1	35366864	Susceptibility of common family Anatidae bird species to clade 2.3.4.4e H5N6 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus: an experimental infection study.	Soda K, Tomioka Y, Hidaka C, Matsushita M, Usui T, Yamaguchi T	BMC Vet Res	 2022 Apr 2;18(1):127	 doi: 101186/s12917-022-03222-7	BACKGROUND: There were large outbreaks of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) caused by clade 2.3.4.4e H5N6 viruses in the winter of 2016-2017 in Japan, which caused large numbers of deaths among several endangered bird species including cranes, raptors, and birds in Family Anatidae. In this study, susceptibility of common Anatidae to a clade 2.3.4.4e H5N6 HPAI virus was assessed to evaluate their potential to be a source of infection for other birds. Eurasian wigeons (Mareca penelope), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and Northern pintails (Anas acuta) were intranasally inoculated with 10(6), 10(4), or 10(2) 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) of clade 2.3.4.4e A/teal/Tottori/1/2016 (H5N6). RESULTS: All birds survived for 10 days without showing any clinical signs of infection. Most ducks inoculated with >/= 10(4) EID50 of virus seroconverted within 10 days post-inoculation (dpi). Virus was mainly shed via the oral route for a maximum of 10 days, followed by cloacal route in late phase of infection. Virus remained in the pancreas of some ducks at 10 dpi. Viremia was observed in some ducks euthanized at 3 dpi, and </= 10(6.3) EID50 of virus was recovered from systemic tissues and swab samples including eyeballs and conjunctival swabs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the subject duck species have a potential to be a source of infection of clade 2.3.4.4e HPAI virus to the environment and other birds sharing their habitats. Captive ducks should be reared under isolated or separated circumstances during the HPAI epidemic season to prevent infection and further viral dissemination.
2	35353676	Differential gene expression reveals host factors for viral shedding variation in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza virus.	Dolinski AC, Homola JJ, Jankowski MD, Robinson JD, Owen JC	J Gen Virol	 2022 Mar;103(3)	 doi: 101099/jgv0001724	Intraspecific variation in pathogen shedding impacts disease transmission dynamics; therefore, understanding the host factors associated with individual variation in pathogen shedding is key to controlling and preventing outbreaks. In this study, ileum and bursa of Fabricius tissues of wild-bred mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAIV) were evaluated at various post-infection time points to determine genetic host factors associated with intraspecific variation in viral shedding. By analysing transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq), we found that LPAIV-infected wild-bred mallards do not exhibit differential gene expression compared to uninfected birds, but that gene expression was associated with cloacal viral shedding quantity early in the infection. In both tissues, immune gene expression was higher in high/moderate shedding birds compared to low shedding birds, and significant positive relationships with viral shedding were observed. In the ileum, expression for host genes involved in viral cell entry was lower in low shedders compared to moderate shedders at 1 day post-infection (DPI), and expression for host genes promoting viral replication was higher in high shedders compared to low shedders at 2 DPI. Our findings indicate that viral shedding is a key factor for gene expression differences in LPAIV-infected wild-bred mallards, and the genes identified in this study could be important for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving intraspecific variation in pathogen shedding.
3	35256126	Philophthalmus gralli in domestic waterfowl: An environmental study in an urban area from Brazil.	Assis JCA, Pulido-Murillo E, Melo AL, Martins NRDS, Pinto HA	Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports	 2022 Apr;29:100701	 doi: 101016/jvprsr2022100701 Epub 2022 Feb 2	Philophthalmosis is a zoonotic ocular disease that affects mainly domestic and wild avian species in different parts of the world. However, aspects related to its epizoology in domestic animals are not completely known. In the present study, 47 Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), 8 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) and 6 African geese (Anser cygnoides), free-living in an urban lake in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, were evaluated for eye fluke infection. The animals were manually contained, and the conjunctival sac and nictitating membrane were evaluated by direct ophthalmic examination (DOE), in which the fluke burden was estimated by a semiquantitative scale. Moreover, the conjunctival sac lavage (CSL) technique was applied for the search of parasite eggs. When possible, the detected trematodes were carefully removed for fixed for taxonomic identification. In order to characterize the parasite-host-environmental system, malacological collections were performed at the locality, and the collected intermediate host mollusks (Melanoides tuberculata) were evaluated for infection with larval philophthalmids. In addition, wild vertebrates found dead in the locality, including one common gallinule (Gallinula galeata) and two capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), were necropsied for the search of eye flukes. Samples from the developmental stages obtained from the hosts were subjected to morphological and molecular studies (amplification and sequencing of a partial region of the Nad-1 gene). In the DOE, the presence of eye flukes was verified in 67% (4/6), 31% (15/47) and 25% (2/8) in geese, Muscovy ducks and mallards, respectively. In most cases, the birds showed mild parasitism (1-5 trematodes), with no apparent eye damage, characterizing a subclinical infection. In only one goose, which had a high fluke burden (20 trematodes), it was possible to obtain eggs by CSL. Regarding the malacological survey, 73/4545 (1.6%) specimens of M. tuberculata evaluated were found infected with megalurous cercariae, compatible with representatives of the family Philophthalmidae. Additionally, 147 flukes were recovered from a specimen of G. galeata found dead at the lake. The morphological and molecular study of parasites obtained from different hosts evaluated in this study enabled the identification of Philophthalmus gralli, a species native from Asia and introduced in the Americas. Factors such as the wide distribution of the intermediate host and the participation of domestic and wild reservoirs in the parasite transmission chain may favor the occurrence of parasite spillover from wild to domestic birds. Furthermore, the occurrence of the life cycle of P. gralli in an urban waterbody serves as an alert to the possibility of human cases of this zoonotic eye parasite.
4	35222974	Effects of weather variation on waterfowl migration: Lessons from a continental-scale generalizable avian movement and energetics model.	Aagaard KJ, Lonsdorf EV, Thogmartin WE	Ecol Evol	 2022 Feb 17;12(2):e8617	 doi: 101002/ece38617 eCollection 2022 Feb	We developed a continental energetics-based model of daily mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) movement during the non-breeding period (September to May) to predict year-specific migration and overwinter occurrence. The model approximates movements and stopovers as functions of metabolism and weather, in terms of temperature and frozen precipitation (i.e., snow). The model is a Markov process operating at the population level and is parameterized through a review of literature. We applied the model to 62 years of daily weather data for the non-breeding period. The average proportion of available habitat decreased as weather severity increased, with mortality decreasing as the proportion of available habitat increased. The most commonly used locations during the course of the non-breeding period were generally consistent across years, with the most inter-annual variation present in the overwintering area. Our model revealed that the distribution of mallards on the landscape changed more dramatically when the variation in daily available habitat was greater. The main routes for avian migration in North America were predicted by our simulations: the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific flyways. Our model predicted an average of 77.4% survivorship for the non-breeding period across all years (range = 76.4%-78.4%), with lowest survivorship during autumn (90.5 +/- 1.4%), intermediate survivorship in winter (91.8 +/- 0.7%), and greatest survivorship in spring (93.6 +/- 1.1%). We provide the parameters necessary for exploration within and among other taxa to leverage the generalizability of this migration model to a broader expanse of bird species, and across a range of climate change and land use/land cover change scenarios.
5	35142170	Surgical Repair of a Complete Transverse Tracheal Rupture in a Mallard Duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Adair JE, Riggs GL	J Avian Med Surg	 2022 Jan;35(4):451-456	 doi: 101647/19-00026	An adult male mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) of unknown age was presented for acute intermittent respiratory distress that resolved when at rest. The duck had no history or evidence of trauma and had never been intubated. Radiographic imaging revealed a 1-cm tracheal defect at the level of the sixth vertebra. Surgical correction of the defect was pursued, during which a complete transverse tracheal rupture of unknown origin was identified. The separated tracheal sections were successfully anastomosed without resection of any tracheal rings. Tracheoscopy performed 2 months after the surgical procedure revealed healthy mucosa at the anastomosis site with a slight narrowing of the tracheal lumen.

Cao P, Nie G, Luo J, Hu R, Li G, Hu G, Zhang C	Food Funct	 2022 Feb 21;13(4):2142-2154	 doi: 101039/d1fo02855c	Cadmium (Cd) and excessive molybdenum (Mo) have adverse impacts on animals. However, the hepatotoxicity co-induced by Cd and Mo in ducks has not been fully elucidated. In order to explore the impacts of Cd and Mo co-exposure on pyroptosis and apoptosis by the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in the livers of ducks, 40 healthy 7-day-old Shaoxing ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were randomly assigned into 4 groups, and Cd or/and Mo were added to the basic diet per kilogram (kg): control group (0 mg Mo and 0 mg Cd), Mo group (100 mg Mo), Cd group (4 mg Cd), and Mo + Cd group (100 mg Mo and 4 mg Cd), with 16 weeks feed management. Results signified that Cd or/and Mo caused trace element imbalance, liver function and histomorphological abnormalities in the duck liver, and activated the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway through increasing PTEN mRNA and protein levels, reducing PI3K, AKT mRNA and p-AKT/AKT protein levels, which triggered pyroptosis and apoptosis via increasing Caspase-1, NLRP3, NEK7, ASC, GSDME, GSDMA, IL-1beta and IL-18 mRNA levels, Caspase-1 p20, NLRP3, ASC and GSDMD protein levels, and IL-1beta and IL-18 contents, and increasing Bak-1, Bax, Cyt C and Caspase-3 mRNA levels and cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 protein level, and downregulating Bcl-2 mRNA level and the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax, respectively. Overall, the results illustrate that pyroptosis and apoptosis induced by Cd or/and Mo may be associated with activating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in the livers of ducks. There may be a synergy between these two elements.
7	35106300	Prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in three groups of domestic poultry managed under backyard system in the Savanna subregion, Department of Sucre, Colombia.	Montes-Vergara DE, Cardona-Alvarez J, Perez-Cordero A	J Adv Vet Anim Res	 2021 Nov 1;8(4):606-611	 doi: 105455/javar2021h551 eCollection 2021 Dec	Objective: To identify the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites that affect the backyard poultry system in the Savanna region, Department of Sucre, Colombia. Materials and Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 860 native birds, both hens (Gallus domesticus), ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), and turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), regardless of age and sex. Samples were processed using direct techniques with ZnSO4 and indirect methods such as modified Sloss. Data were presented as frequencies, and the nonparametric odds ratio test was used for two independent samples. Results: A total of 77.3% (665/860) of the birds were infected with one or more species of gastrointestinal parasites. Among the nematodes, Capillaria spp. (45.6%), Ascaridia galli (18.4%), Heterakis gallinarum (59.4%), Syngamus trachea (38.9%), Tetrameres spp. (25.2%), and Strongylus spp. (12.2%) were recorded. The cestodes were Choanotaenia infundibulum (22.6%), Davainea proglottina (42.3%), Raillietina spp. (58.3%), and Hymenolepis spp. (54.7%), while only Eimeria spp. (90%) was recorded as protozoa. Conclusions: The study showed a high incidence of gastrointestinal parasite infestations, the most common species being Hymenolepis spp., Eimeria spp., Raillietina spp., and Heterakis gallinarum.
8	35094630	Transcriptome analysis of genes potentially associated with white and black plumage formation in Chinese indigenous ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lin R, Li J, Zhao F, Zhou M, Wang J, Xiao T	Br Poult Sci	 2022 Feb 18:1-9	 doi: 101080/0007166820222035676	1. Plumage colour is an important recognisable characteristic of duck (Anas platyrhynchos), but the colouration mechanisms remain largely unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of black and white plumage, the following study applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to catalogue the global gene expression profiles in the duck feather bulbs of black and white colours.2. Black feather bulbs were collected from Putian Black ducks (B-PTB) and black Longsheng Jade-green ducks (B-LS), while white feather bulbs were collected from Putian White ducks (W-PTW), Putian Black ducks (W-PTB) and Longsheng Jade-green ducks (W-LS). Sixteen cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced for transcriptional analysis. Three comparison groups were employed to analyse differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including W-PTB versus B-PTB, W-PTW versus B-PTB and W-LS versus B-LS.3. The results showed 180 DEGs between W-PTB and B-PTB, 303 DEGs between W-PTW and B-PTB, and 108 DEGs between W-LS and B-LS. Further analysis showed that 18 DEGs were directly involved in the pigmentation process and melanogenesis signalling pathway. Additionally, the distribution of DEGs varied amongst groups whereby ASIP appeared only in the W-LS versus B-LS group, GNAI1 and ZEB2 appeared only in the W-PTW versus B-PTB group, and KITLG, EDN3 and FZD4 appeared only in W-PTB versus B-PTB.4. The findings suggested that the mechanism of feather albinism may differ between duck breeds. This study provided new information for discovering genes that are important for feather pigmentation and helps elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in black and white plumage in ducks.

Rosenbaum CS, Wunschmann A, Armien AG, Schott R, Singh VK, Mor SK	J Vet Diagn Invest	 2022 Mar;34(2):231-236	 doi: 101177/10406387221075607 Epub 2022 Jan 28	Papillomaviruses, which are epitheliotropic and may induce epithelial tumors, have been identified in several avian species, including ducks. An adult female mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was admitted to a wildlife rehabilitation center with 2 beige, well-demarcated, firm masses: one in the subcutis under a wing, and the other on a digit of the right foot. After euthanasia, the masses were fixed in formalin for histologic examination. Both tumors had a lobular organization with cartilage cores surrounded by densely cellular interlacing bundles of spindle cells. Neoplastic chondroblasts in both masses, particularly the digital mass, contained basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, which consisted of assembly complexes of icosahedral virions of 44-nm diameter. Next-generation sequencing allowed whole genome assembly of a novel papillomavirus (Anas platyrhynchos papillomavirus 2) related most closely to Fulmarus glacialis papillomavirus 1 (59.49% nucleotide identity). Our case supports the observation that certain papillomaviruses can productively infect mesenchymal cells and induce neoplasia.
10	35068101	Rapid Emergence of the Reassortant 2.3.4.4b H5N2 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in a Live Poultry Market in Xinjiang, Northwest China.	Aji D, Chang N, Zhang C, Du F, Li J, Yun F, Shi W, Bi Y, Ma Z	Avian Dis	 2021 Dec;65(4):578-583	 doi: 101637/aviandiseases-D-21-00075	Live poultry markets (LPMs) play a key role in reassorting and spreading avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In 2018, four strains of H5N2 AIVs were isolated from domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) during AIV surveillance from the LPM in Urumqi, Xinjiang, China. All gene segments of the isolates were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and sequenced; then, the viral genetic mutations, reassortant, and origin were analyzed. Higher nucleotide identities were observed among each gene of the isolates, indicating a common ancestor. The hemagglutinin (HA) genes of the isolates all classified into the clade 2.3.4.4b; the HA, matrix protein (MP), and nonstructural protein (NS) genes were all clustered together with the local H5N6 highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) identified in the same LPM of Urumqi in July 2017; the neuraminidase albumen, polymerase basic proteins 1 and 2, polymerase acidic protein, and nucleocapsid protein genes (NA, PB1, PB2, PA, and NP) all had close phylogenetic relationships with the local H9N2 AIVs identified in the same LPM from September to October 2018. Multiple basic amino acids were present at the cleavage site of the HA protein, which was associated with HPAIVs. These results indicated that the reassortant clade 2.3.4.4b H5N2 HPAIVs were rapidly generated from reassortment between the H5N6 and H9N2 AIVs in the local LPM of Urumqi in 2018.
11	34995644	Sex differences in serum glucocorticoid levels and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios in adult pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Tetel V, Tonissen S, Fraley GS	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2022 Feb 1;317:113975	 doi: 101016/jygcen2021113975 Epub 2022 Jan 4	It is becoming more common for poultry scientists to utilize direct and indirect measures of stress hormones to monitor bird welfare. However, it has been clear that our understanding of the avian hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (HPA) is insufficient as evidenced by the many conflicting reports regarding stress responses, such as transportation stress, in poultry. It has long been assumed that the poultry HPA functions similarly to that of mammals, but now we know that there are considerable differences in the avian HPA compared to mammals. Synthesis and release of glucocorticoids (GC) are stimulated by adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH); GC are synthesized from a common pathway that begins with cholesterol and pregnenolone. The synthesis of one of the glucocorticoids does not depend upon the synthesis of the other. The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that ACTH will stimulate both corticosterone and cortisol release in ducks. To test this hypothesis, we injected artificial ACTH (cosyntropin; 0.0625 mg/kg, 0.031 mg/kg, or 0.016 mg/kg or saline as control) intramuscularly into adult drakes and hens (N = 10/sex/dose). Both glucocorticoids (GC) were assayed in serum using previously verified ELISAs. Blood smears were also assessed for heterophil to lymphocyte ratios (HLR). Data were analyzed by repeated measures 3-way ANOVA with Fishers PLSD as an ad hoc test. We observed that both GC were secreted in significantly (p = 0.0002) different patterns in a dose-dependent manner compared to controls, and that there was a significant (p = 0.0001) sex difference in both GC compared to saline controls. Further, we observed that all doses of ACTH elicited a significant (p = 0.004) sex difference in the HLR response compared to controls, but no dose-dependent effects were noted. Our data suggest that ducks, at least, may utilize more than just corticosterone to maintain physiological homeostasis in response to stress. Further, the time course of the stressor to release GC and subsequent HLR response may be dependent upon sex. More detailed analyses of the HPA are necessary in all avian species to better understand stress responses as we utilize biological bases for welfare assessments and stress responses.
12	34986903	Environmental drivers of autumn migration departure decisions in midcontinental mallards.	Weller FG, Beatty WS, Webb EB, Kesler DC, Krementz DG, Asante K, Naylor LW	Mov Ecol	 2022 Jan 5;10(1):1	 doi: 101186/s40462-021-00299-x	BACKGROUND: The timing of autumn migration in ducks is influenced by a range of environmental conditions that may elicit individual experiences and responses from individual birds, yet most studies have investigated relationships at the population level. We used data from individual satellite-tracked mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to model the timing and environmental drivers of autumn migration movements at a continental scale. METHODS: We combined two sets of location records (2004-2007 and 2010-2011) from satellite-tracked mallards during autumn migration in the Mississippi Flyway, and identified records that indicated the start of long-range (>/= 30 km) southward movements during the migration period. We modeled selection of departure date by individual mallards using a discrete choice model accounting for heterogeneity in individual preferences. We developed candidate models to predict the departure date, conditional on daily mean environmental covariates (i.e. temperature, snow and ice cover, wind conditions, precipitation, cloud cover, and pressure) at a 32 x 32 km resolution. We ranked model performance with the Bayesian Information Criterion. RESULTS: Departure was best predicted (60% accuracy) by a "winter conditions" model containing temperature, and depth and duration of snow cover. Models conditional on wind speed, precipitation, pressure variation, and cloud cover received lower support. Number of days of snow cover, recently experienced snow cover (snow days) and current snow cover had the strongest positive effect on departure likelihood, followed by number of experienced days of freezing temperature (frost days) and current low temperature. Distributions of dominant drivers and of correct vs incorrect prediction along the movement tracks indicate that these responses applied throughout the latitudinal range of migration. Among recorded departures, most were driven by snow days (65%) followed by current temperature (30%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that among the tested environmental parameters, the dominant environmental driver of departure decision in autumn-migrating mallards was the onset of snow conditions, and secondarily the onset of temperatures close to, or below, the freezing point. Mallards are likely to relocate southwards quickly when faced with snowy conditions, and could use declining temperatures as a more graduated early cue for departure. Our findings provide further insights into the functional response of mallards to weather factors during the migration period that ultimately determine seasonal distributions.
13	34970593	RIGI, TLR7, and TLR3 Genes Were Predicted to Have Immune Response Against Avian Influenza in Indigenous Ducks.	Pal A, Pal A, Baviskar P	Front Mol Biosci	 2021 Dec 14;8:633283	 doi: 103389/fmolb2021633283 eCollection 2021	Avian influenza is a disease with every possibility to evolve as a human-to-human pandemic arising out of frequent mutations and genetic reassortment or recombination of avian influenza (AI) virus. The greatest concern is that till date, no satisfactory medicine or vaccines are available, leading to massive culling of poultry birds, causing huge economic loss and ban on export of chicken products, which emphasizes the need to develop an alternative strategy for control of AI. In the current study, we attempt to explore the molecular mechanism of innate immune potential of ducks against avian influenza. In the present study, we have characterized immune response molecules such as duck TLR3, TLR7, and RIGI that are predicted to have potent antiviral activities against the identified strain of avian influenza through in silico studies (molecular docking) followed by experimental validation with differential mRNA expression analysis. Future exploitation may include immunomodulation with the recombinant protein, and transgenic or gene-edited chicken resistant to bird flu.
14	34958264	Phylogenetic Analysis of H5N8 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Ukraine, 2016-2017.	Sapachova M, Kovalenko G, Sushko M, Bezymennyi M, Muzyka D, Usachenko N, Mezhenskyi A, Abramov A, Essen S, Lewis NS, Bortz E	Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis	 2021 Dec;21(12):979-988	 doi: 101089/vbz20210031	Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) can be carried long distances by migratory wild birds and by poultry trade. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is often lethal in domestic poultry and can sporadically infect and cause severe respiratory or systemic disease in other species including humans. Since 2003, the H5 subtype of HPAIV have spread from epicenters in China to neighboring regions in East and Southeast Asia, and across Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent, Europe, Africa, and North America. Outbreaks of H5N1 HPAIV struck poultry in Ukraine in 2005. In 2016, A H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIV outbreaks occurred in wild and domestic birds in Ukraine concurrently with outbreaks in Central Europe, Russia, and the Middle East. We report outbreaks of HPAI in domestic backyard poultry in (2016-2017) in the southern region of Ukraine, in proximity to mass gathering sites for migratory waterfowl including mute swans (Cygnus olor). All eight genome segments of three novel H5N8 HPAIV isolated in November 2016 from two domestic backyard chickens (Gallus gallus) and one backyard mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) found dead of HPAI in Azov-Black Sea region of Ukraine were cladistically related to H5N8 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses isolated from wild shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) in Askania Nova Biopreserve (Kherson district, Ukraine) in 2016-2017 and to other contemporary H5N8 HPAIV strains sequenced from wild birds and poultry in Eurasia. Amino acid variations in hemagglutinin were outside of the polybasic cleavage site (PLREKRRKR/GLF), and D224G suggested avian-like receptor binding specificity; neuraminidase did not have mutations characteristic of oseltamivir drug resistance. Outbreaks of HPAI in Ukraine highlight the continual need for biosurveillance and genomic sequencing of avian influenza viruses along wild bird flyways and interfaces with domestic poultry in Eurasia.

Kumbar V, Ondrusikova S, Trost D, Polcar A, Nedomova S	Foods	 2021 Dec 17;10(12)	 pii: foods10123130 doi: 103390/foods10123130	Liquid egg products are one of the basic raw materials for the food industry. Knowledge of their rheological and flow behaviour in real technical elements is absolutely necessary for the selection of suitable technological equipment for their processing. In this article, the rheological properties of liquid egg products were determined. Eggs from six different species of poultry are used: domestic hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) hybrid Hisex Brown; Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica); German carrier goose (Anser anser f. domestica); domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica); domestic guinea fowl (Numida meleagris f. domestica); and domestic turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo f. domestica). Liquid egg products showed pseudoplastic behaviour in range of shear strain rates from 0.2 up to 200 s(-1) and at the temperature of 18 degrees C. Thus, the flow curves were constructed using the Ostwald-de Waele rheological model, with respect to the pseudoplastic behaviour of liquid egg products. According to the values of the coefficients of determination (R(2)), the sum of squared estimate of errors (SSE) and the root mean square error (RMSE), this model was appropriately chosen. Using the consistency coefficient K, the flow index n and the adjusted equations for the flow rate of technical and biological fluids in standard pipelines, the 3D velocity profiles of liquid egg products were successfully modelled. The values of the Reynolds number of the individual liquid egg products were calculated, and the type of flow was also determined. A turbulent flow has been detected for some liquid egg products.
16	34944363	Effects of Dietary Resveratrol Supplementation on Growth Performance and Anti-Inflammatory Ability in Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) through the Nrf2/HO-1 and TLR4/NF-kappaB Signaling Pathways.	Yang H, Wang Y, Liu M, Liu X, Jiao Y, Jin S, Shan A, Feng X	Animals (Basel)	 2021 Dec 18;11(12)	 pii: ani11123588 doi: 103390/ani11123588	The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dietary resveratrol on the growth performance and anti-inflammatory mechanism in ducks. A total of 280 one-day-old specific pathogen-free male ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) with an average body weight of 35 +/- 1 g were randomly divided into two dietary treatment groups with different supplementation levels of resveratrol for growth performance experiments: R0 and R400 (0 and, 400 mg kg(-1) resveratrol, respectively). At the age of 28 days, 16 ducks were selected from each treatment group and divided into four subgroups for a 2 x 2 factorial pathological experiment: R0; R400; R0 + LPS; R400 + LPS, (0 mg kg(-1) resveratrol, 400 mg kg(-1) resveratrol, 0 mg kg(-1) resveratrol, 400 mg kg(-1) resveratrol + 5 mg lipopolysaccharide/kg body weight). The results showed that resveratrol significantly improved final body weight and average daily gain (p < 0.01) and alleviated the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response with a reduction in IL-1beta and IL-6 in the plasma and the liver (p < 0.05). Resveratrol improved mRNA levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 and decreased the mRNA levels of TLR4 and NF-kappaB in duck liver (p < 0.05). Dietary resveratrol can improve growth performance and reduce inflammation through the Nrf2/HO-1 and TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathways in duck.

The study assessed 34 White Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) (study 1) in a non-stunned halal slaughterhouse in Brazil for time to loss of consciousness using various behavioral and brainstem indices (balance, cranial nerve reflexes, and muscle tension) and assessed the relationship between extent of clotting, location of neck cut, level of damage to neck vessels/tissues, and the time to onset of unconsciousness. In addition, operator practices were separately observed and neck pathology following the cut was examined in 217 carcasses after bleeding (study 2). In study 1 following the neck cut there was a wide variation between birds in the time to loss of behavioral and brainstem indices, ranging from 20 to 334 and 20 to 383 s for neck and beak tension, respectively. The median time to loss of balance following the neck cut was 166 +/- 14 (22-355) seconds. There was a moderate correlation (R = 0.60 and 0.62) between distance of the neck cut and time to loss of balance and neck tension, respectively. This is the first investigation of the time to loss of consciousness following non-stunned slaughter of ducks in commercial conditions. The findings could be used to improve the welfare of ducks during non-stunned slaughter, such as recommending performance of the neck cut closer to the jaw line and ensuring appropriate waiting periods between slaughter and birds entering the scalding tanks.
18	34944291	Resveratrol Relieved Acute Liver Damage in Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) Induced by AFB1 via Modulation of Apoptosis and Nrf2 Signaling Pathways.	Liu F, Wang Y, Zhou X, Liu M, Jin S, Shan A, Feng X	Animals (Basel)	 2021 Dec 10;11(12)	 pii: ani11123516 doi: 103390/ani11123516	The presence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in feed is a serious threat to livestock and poultry health and to human food safety. Resveratrol (Res) is a polyphenolic compound with antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and other biological activities; however, it is not clear whether it can improve AFB1 induced hepatotoxicity. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary Res on liver injury induced by AFB1 and its mechanisms. A total of 270 one-day-old male specific pathogen free (SPF) ducks, with no significant difference in weight, were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the AFB1 group and the AFB1 + Res group, which were fed a basic diet, a basic diet and a basic diet containing 500 mg/kg Res, respectively. On the 70th day, the ducks in theAFB1 group and the AFB1+ 500 mg/kg Res group were given 60 mug/kg AFB1 via gavage. When comparing the AFB1 group and the AFB1 + Res group and also with the control group, AFB1 significantly increased liver damage, cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and AFB1-DNA adduct content, increased oxidative stress levels and induced liver apoptosis, which was improved by Res supplementation. In sum, the addition of Res to feed can increase the activity of the II-phase enzyme, activate the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signal pathway, and protect ducks' livers from the toxicity, oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction induced by AFB1.
19	34924861	Changes of Land Use and Land Cover with the Diversity of Fishes, Aquatic Plants, and Bird's Species at Wetland Ecosystem.	Alam MZ, Baki Bhuiyan MA, Abdullah HM, Ghosh SR, Hassan MM, Akter R, Rokonuzzaman M, Alam MS	ScientificWorldJournal	 2021 Dec 8;2021:7533119	 doi: 101155/2021/7533119 eCollection 2021	Bangladesh is rich in wetland biodiversity with aquatic plants, fishes, and birds. Mohanganj Upazila is known as the capital of lower Bangladesh. The present study focuses on the changes of land use and land cover (LULC) with a diversity of species that are being least concerned (LC), vulnerable (VU), and endangered (EN). Over the last two decades, the wetland species of Mohanganj were gradually declined. Our results showed that 19 fish, 4 aquatic plants, and 7 bird species were LC in 2015. Among the fish and aquatic plant species, 6 fish species (Wallago attu, Ompok pabda, Channa punctate, Chitala chitala, Salmostoma phulo, and Corica soborna) and 2 aquatic plant species (Nymphaea nouchali and Nymphaea lotus) were VU during the dry and rainy season of 2017 and 2019, respectively. In the dry season of 2019, 4 fish species (W. attu, O. pabda, C. punctate, and Ch. chitala), 2 aquatic plant species (N. nouchali and N. lotus), and 7 bird species (Anas platyrhynchos, Ardeola grayii, Gyps bengalensis, Alcedo atthis, Phalacrocorax fuscicollis, Porphyrio porphyria, and Larus ridibundus) were EN. Among the species, W. attu, N. nouchaii, G. bengalensis, P. porphyria, and L. ridibundus were extremely endangered categories. Changes in LULC, the establishment of settlements for the increasing population, indiscriminate use of pesticides, environmental pollutions, and climate change are the potential reasons for declining trends of wetland biodiversity. Stern actions on land use policy, expansion of organic agriculture, bioremediation of industrial effluents, and adoption of sustainable environmental policies should be taken by the Government of Bangladesh for immediate conservation of wetland biodiversity.
20	34923880	Genetic variants in SCNN1B and AHCYL1 are associated with eggshell quality in Chinese domestic laying ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Liao CM, Tan GH, You MF, Li JZ, Wu L, Qin YY, Zhang YY	Br Poult Sci	 2021 Dec 20	 doi: 101080/0007166820212019678	1. The objective of this study was to investigate the evolution of SCNN1B and AHCYL1 proteins among 10 domestic and mammalian animals, to uncover the expression patterns of SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes in ducks, identify the genetic variants of the SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes and analyse their effects on eggshell quality.2. Expression profiles of the SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes in Sansui female ducks were determined using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR to identify SNPs. The duck SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes were amplified to identify SNPs. A total of 502 Sansui female ducks were genotyped by sequencing, and the associations between the mRNA expression/SNP genotypes and six eggshell quality indices were analysed using PASW Statistics 18.0.3. The results showed that the SCNN1B and AHCYL1 proteins are highly conserved in different mammalian or domestic animals, especially the AHCYL1 protein. The SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes were widely expressed in different tissues of male and female ducks, and expression level in the uterus was greater than in other tissues. The expression of SCNN1B and AHCYL1 during oviposition cycle indicated that expression levels were related to the eggshell mineralisation stage.4. The mRNA expression levels of uterine SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes were positively correlated with eggshell strength (ESS), percentage (ESP) and weight (ESW) (P<0.05), respectively. Ten novel SNPs in SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes from Chinese domestic laying ducks were identified through PCR amplicon sequencing.5. Genetic association analysis indicated g.797509 C > T, g.797573 C > T and g.797834 C > T in SCNN1B gene and g.169244 T > A, g.169265 T > C and g.175311T > C in AHCYL1 gene had a significant effect on eggshell quality. Correlation analysis between the SNP genotype and SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes expression in the uterus showed that the genotypes of g.797509 C>T, g.797573 C>T, g.797834 C>T, g.169244 T>A and g.175311T>C sites affected the expression of SCNN1B and AHCYL1 genes in utero (P<0.05).6. The study indicated SCNN1B and AHCYL1 as candidate genes to improve eggshell traits in ducks.

Khalefa HS, Ahmed ZS, Abdel-Kader F, Ismail EM, Elshafiee EA	Vet World	 2021 Oct;14(10):2764-2772	 doi: 1014202/vetworld20212764-2772 Epub 2021 Oct 26	Background and Aim: Salmonella causes most foodborne bacterial illnesses worldwide. It is found in various hosts, including pets, farm animals, and wild animals, as well as the environment. This study aimed to examine the epidemiological relationship between Salmonella isolates from aquatic environments and those from other avian hosts. Materials and Methods: The study examined 12 water samples, 210 aquatic animals, and 45 migratory aquatic bird samples collected from the protected area of Lake Qarun in El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt, during migration seasons from different waterfowl migration areas (from October 2018 to January 2019). In addition, 45 fecal samples from domestic chickens were collected from the same geographic location from poultry farms. Bacteriological examination and polymerase chain reaction assay of two virulence genes (i.e., invA and stn) were performed to isolate and identify Salmonella. Results: Salmonella was isolated from 58.3% (7/12) of Lake Qarun water samples, 13.3% (6/45) of migratory waterfowl, 6.6% of (3/45) of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), and 4.3% (3/70) of fish and pooled brine shrimp. In migratory aquatic bird species that were sampled, Salmonella were isolated from 23.1% (3/13) of Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), 12.5%, (1/8) of green-winged teal (Anas cardolinesis), 10% (2/20) of northern shoveler (Spatula clypeata), and 0% (0/4) of mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). In 35 Tilapia, Salmonella was isolated by (8.6%) 5.7% of external surfaces, 2.85% from the intestine, and 0% from the muscle. No Salmonella was isolated from the 175 brine shrimp samples. Phylogenetic analysis using the stn genes of Salmonella isolated from the aquatic environment, migratory aquatic birds, and chicken showed a strong association between these isolates. In addition, a higher nucleotide identity percentage was observed between the sequences recovered from migratory aquatic birds and Lake Qarun water samples. Conclusion: Salmonella distribution was confirmed through migratory aquatic birds, based on our phylogeny tree analysis, Salmonella considered a likely carrier of zoonotic bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, the close relationship between chicken and fish sequences highlights the scenarios of using chicken manure in fish farms and its public health implications. The presence of Salmonella in different environmental sources spotlights the urgent need to control and break down its epidemiological cycle.
22	34837623	Characterization of the trophic transfer and fate of methylmercury in the food web of Zhalong Wetland, Northeastern China.	Luo J, Zhang W, Bai L, Li H, Gao Z	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	 2022 Apr;29(17):25222-25233	 doi: 101007/s11356-021-17675-0 Epub 2021 Nov 27	The transfer and fate of methylmercury (MeHg) in typical components, such as sediment, sediment-inhabiting animals, pelagic fish, and three large waterfowls, namely, red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana), of the ecosystem in China's Zhalong Wetland were examined using equivalence-based mass balance model. The biomagnification degree of MeHg increased on the species at the high trophic level of the system. Hence, elevated MeHg concentration (3.2 mug g(-1), dry weight) was detected in the endangered G. japonensis. The accumulation of the organometal generally followed the decreasing order of oriental stork (carnivore) > mallard (omnivore) > red-crowned crane (omnivore). The predicted results of MeHg at each node of the food web were generally in accordance with the measured values (F = 0.09, P = 0.78), implying that the model is suitable for the prediction of MeHg fate in the inland aquatic system. According to the model, the respiration for the species at low trophic strata was the key input source of MeHg, but ingestion played an important role for MeHg intake in the species at the high trophic position in the food web. Metabolism was a crucial pathway of MeHg loss for the top predators in the ecosystem.
23	34815022	Acute oral toxicity and tissue residues of saxitoxin in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Dusek RJ, Smith MM, Van Hemert C, Shearn-Bochsler VI, Hall S, Ridge CD, Hardison DR, Kaler RSA, Bodenstein BL, Hofmeister EK, Hall JS	Harmful Algae	 2021 Nov;109:102109	 doi: 101016/jhal2021102109 Epub 2021 Oct 9	Since 2014, widespread, annual mortality events involving multiple species of seabirds have occurred in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Chukchi Sea. Among these die-offs, emaciation was a common finding with starvation often identified as the cause of death. However, saxitoxin (STX) was detected in many carcasses, indicating exposure of these seabirds to STX in the marine environment. Few data are available that describe the effects of STX in birds, thus presenting challenges for determining its contributions to specific mortality events. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted an acute oral toxicity trial in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), a common laboratory avian model, using an up-and-down method to estimate the median lethal dose (LD50) for STX. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we tested select tissues from all birds and feces from those individuals that survived initial dosing. Samples with an ELISA result that exceeded approximately 10 microg 100 g(-1) STX and randomly selected ELISA negative samples were further tested by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Tissues collected from mallards were also examined grossly at necropsy and then later by microscopy to identify lesions attributable to STX. The estimated LD50 was 167 microg kg(-1) (95% CI = 69-275 microg kg(-1)). Saxitoxin was detected in fecal samples of all mallards tested for up to 48 h after dosing and at the end of the sampling period (7 d) in three birds. In those individuals that died or were euthanized <2 h after dosing, STX was readily detected throughout the gastrointestinal tract but only infrequently in heart, kidney, liver, lung, and breast muscle. No gross or microscopic lesions were observed that could be attributable to STX exposure. Given its acute toxicity, limited detectability, and frequent occurrence in the Alaska marine environment, additional research on STX in seabirds is warranted.

Campbell LK, Fleming-Canepa X, Webster RG, Magor KE	Front Immunol	 2021 Nov 5;12:786205	 doi: 103389/fimmu2021786205 eCollection 2021	Ducks are the natural host and reservoir of influenza A virus (IAV), and as such are permissive to viral replication while being unharmed by most strains. It is not known which mechanisms of viral control are globally regulated during infection, and which are specific to tissues during infection. Here we compare transcript expression from tissues from Pekin ducks infected with a recombinant H5N1 strain A/Vietnam 1203/04 (VN1203) or an H5N2 strain A/British Columbia 500/05 using RNA-sequencing analysis and aligning reads to the NCBI assembly ZJU1.0 of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) genome. Highly pathogenic VN1203 replicated in lungs and showed systemic dissemination, while BC500, like most low pathogenic strains, replicated in the intestines. VN1203 infection induced robust differential expression of genes all three days post infection, while BC500 induced the greatest number of differentially expressed genes on day 2 post infection. While there were many genes globally upregulated in response to either VN1203 or BC500, tissue specific gene expression differences were observed. Lungs of ducks infected with VN1203 and intestines of birds infected with BC500, tissues important in influenza replication, showed highest upregulation of pattern recognition receptors and interferon stimulated genes early in the response. These tissues also appear to have specific downregulation of inflammatory components, with downregulation of distinct sets of proinflammatory cytokines in lung, and downregulation of key components of leukocyte recruitment and complement pathways in intestine. Our results suggest that global and tissue specific regulation patterns help the duck control viral replication as well as limit some inflammatory responses in tissues involved in replication to avoid damage.
25	34780047	Identification of Trueperella bernardiae isolated from peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) by phenotypical and genotypical investigations and by a newly developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay.	Ahmed MFE, Alssahen M, Lammler C, Kohler B, Metzner M, Plotz M, Abdulmawjood A	Folia Microbiol (Praha)	 2022 Apr;67(2):277-284	 doi: 101007/s12223-021-00927-4 Epub 2021 Nov 15	Trueperella (T.) bernardiae is a well-known bacterial pathogen in infections of humans, rarely in animals. In the present study, five T. bernardiae isolates, isolated from five Peking ducks of four different farms, were identified by phenotypic properties, by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis, and genotypically by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, the superoxide dismutase A encoding gene sodA, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoding gene gap. In addition, the T. bernardiae isolates could be identified with a newly developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay based on the gyrase encoding housekeeping gene gyrA. All these tests clearly identified the T. bernardiae isolates to the species level. However, the detection of the specific gene gyrA with the newly designed LAMP assay appeared with a high sensitivity and specificity, and could help to identify this bacterial species in human and animal infections in future. The importance of the T. bernardiae isolates for the clinical condition of the ducks and for the problems at farm level remains unclear.
26	34729831	Dietary resveratrol alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced ileitis through Nrf2 and NF-kappaB signalling pathways in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Yang H, Wang Y, Jin S, Pang Q, Shan A, Feng X	J Anim Physiol Anim Nutr (Berl)	 2021 Nov 2	 doi: 101111/jpn13657	Gram-negative bacteria contamination of feed can occur at all the stage of feed production, storage, transportation and utilization. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major toxic metabolite of Gram-negative bacteria. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dietary resveratrol on the duck ileitis caused by LPS and its optimum addition level in diet. The results showed that LPS-induced duck ileitis with the destruction of intestinal structure, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory response and permeability alteration. Dietary resveratrol alleviated LPS-induced intestinal dysfunction and the increase of intestinal permeability by linearly increasing mRNA levels of tight junction protein genes (Claudin-1, Occludin-1, ZO-1) (p < 0.05) and protein expression of Claudin-1 (p < 0.01). In addition, dietary resveratrol improved the antioxidant capacity of duck ileum by reducing the production of MDA and increasing the activity of T-SOD (p < 0.01) and CAT. Lipopolysaccharide increased Keap1 at mRNA and protein level (p < 0.01) and decreased the protein level of Nrf2 (p < 0.05). Dietary resveratrol significantly downregulated expression of Keap1 and upregulated expression of Nrf2 in duck (p < 0.05). Dietary resveratrol suppressed the TLR4/NF-kappaB signalling pathway and the expression of its downstream genes including IKK, TXNIP, NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-6 and IL-18. Meanwhile, the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-alpha) showed a linearly decrease (p < 0.01) with increasing dietary resveratrol level. These results demonstrated that resveratrol alleviated the LPS-induced acute ileitis of duck through Nrf2 and NF-kappaB signalling pathways, and the dietary resveratrol of 500 mg/kg is more efficiently.
27	34679819	Comparison of Two Different Feather Sampling Methods to Measure Corticosterone in Wild Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) and Wild Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Voit M, Baumgartner K, von Fersen L, Merle R, Reese L, Wiegard M, Will H, Tallo-Parra O, Carbajal A, Lopez-Bejar M, Thone-Reineke C	Animals (Basel)	 2021 Sep 25;11(10)	 pii: ani11102796 doi: 103390/ani11102796	This research project had the aim to validate the possible alternative and less-painful sampling method of cutting feathers close to the skin instead of plucking them for subsequent feather corticosterone analysis, confirming recently-published results for other species in captivity. Analyzing CORTf is often used in animal welfare studies in combination with behavioral monitoring. The background of this idea was to act in the sense of animal welfare and reduce the burden of animal studies according to the 3-R-Principle (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) by refining procedures. To confirm the hypothesis that the sampling method itself has no influence on CORTf levels measured, plucked and cut samples of the respective bird were collected. Birds of two wild species were used: the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus). The CORTf was measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The determined values were inspected for their mean values, standard deviation (SD), and average differences. Afterwards, the CORTf levels of both species were compared, according to the sampling method, with the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). In the Bland-Altman (BA) plot the differences of the methods were displayed against the mean values. Additionally, sex, as a possible factor influencing CORTf, was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The values of CCC showed poor agreement in the comparability of the two methods, whereas the concordance of the BA plot was decent. The average differences between the methods were marginal for both species (Mallards: -0.16 pg/mm, Flamingos -0.13 pg/mm). In summary, all anomalies or differences between the methods were negligible. Therefore, the alternative sampling method seems to be as suitable as the common standard method. No significant difference was found between females and males. Nevertheless, our results suggest that CORTf should not be interpreted in just considering the values themselves, but the results they should be analyzed in the context of a wider set of parameters. Hence, further studies are encouraged to create a larger data pool.
28	34677035	Osseous Migration of a Perforating Gastrointestinal Foreign Body in an Indian Runner Duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Hollwarth AJ, Reese DJ, Dutton TAG	J Avian Med Surg	 2021 Sep;35(3):361-366	 doi: 101647/20-00051	An Indian runner duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) was presented for a second opinion after a linear, metallic foreign body was identified on radiographic images. The primary veterinarian performed diagnostic imaging while investigating the presenting complaint of the duck's left pelvic limb lameness. The images obtained from a computed tomography scan performed during the second-opinion visit revealed a linear, metallic foreign body with an associated migration tract originating from the ventriculus and terminating in the proximal left femur. Significant osteomyelitis was noted at the proximal left femur associated with the presence of the linear, metallic object. The foreign body and the adhesions associated with its migration were removed in 2, staged, surgical procedures. Although penetrating ventricular foreign bodies have been previously reported, migration through the cortex of a long bone is an unusual presentation. This case demonstrates that perforating, migrating, gastrointestinal foreign bodies can result in lameness refractory to analgesia and ancillary supportive care.

Here, we report chromosome-level high-quality genome assemblies for meat and laying duck breeds, and the Mallard. Our new genomic databases contain annotations for thousands of new protein-coding genes and recover a major percentage of the presumed "missing genes" in birds. We obtain the entire genomic sequences for the C-type lectin (CTL) family members that regulate eggshell biomineralization. Our population and comparative genomics analyses provide more than 36 million sequence variants between duck populations. Furthermore, a mutant cell line allows confirmation of the predicted anti-adipogenic function of NR2F2 in the duck, and uncovered mutations specific to Pekin duck that potentially affect adipose deposition. Our study provides insights into avian evolution and the genetics of oviparity, and will be a rich resource for the future genetic improvement of commercial traits in the duck.
30	34582734	Imprinting on time-structured acoustic stimuli in ducklings.	Monteiro T, Hart T, Kacelnik A	Biol Lett	 2021 Sep;17(9):20210381	 doi: 101098/rsbl20210381 Epub 2021 Sep 29	Filial imprinting is a dedicated learning process that lacks explicit reinforcement. The phenomenon itself is narrowly heritably canalized, but its content, the representation of the parental object, reflects the circumstances of the newborn. Imprinting has recently been shown to be even more subtle and complex than previously envisaged, since ducklings and chicks are now known to select and represent for later generalization abstract conceptual properties of the objects they perceive as neonates, including movement pattern, heterogeneity and inter-component relationships of same or different. Here, we investigate day-old Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings' bias towards imprinting on acoustic stimuli made from mallards' vocalizations as opposed to white noise, whether they imprint on the temporal structure of brief acoustic stimuli of either kind, and whether they generalize timing information across the two sounds. Our data are consistent with a strong innate preference for natural sounds, but do not reliably establish sensitivity to temporal relations. This fits with the view that imprinting includes the establishment of representations of both primary percepts and selective abstract properties of their early perceptual input, meshing together genetically transmitted prior pre-dispositions with active selection and processing of the perceptual input.
31	34521392	Rainfall driven and wild-bird mediated avian influenza virus outbreaks in Australian poultry.	Ferenczi M, Beckmann C, Klaassen M	BMC Vet Res	 2021 Sep 14;17(1):306	 doi: 101186/s12917-021-03010-9	Globally, outbreaks of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) in poultry continue to burden economies and endanger human, livestock and wildlife health. Wild waterbirds are often identified as possible sources for poultry infection. Therefore, it is important to understand the ecological and environmental factors that directly influence infection dynamics in wild birds, as these factors may thereby indirectly affect outbreaks in poultry. In Australia, where large parts of the country experience erratic rainfall patterns, intense rainfalls lead to wild waterfowl breeding events at temporary wetlands and increased proportions of immunologically naive juvenile birds. It is hypothesized that after breeding, when the temporary wetlands dry, increasing densities of immunologically naive waterbirds returning to permanent water bodies might strongly contribute to AIV prevalence in wild waterfowl in Australia. Since rainfall has been implicated as an important environmental driver in AIV dynamics in wild waterbirds in southeast Australia and wild waterbirds are identified globally to have a role in virus spillover into poultry, we hypothesise that rainfall events have an indirect effect on AIV outbreaks in poultry in southeast Australia. In this study we investigated this hypothesis by examining the correlation between the timing of AIV outbreaks in poultry in and near the Murray-Darling basin in relation to temporal patterns in regional rainfall since 1970. Our findings support our hypothesis and suggest that the risk of AIV outbreaks in poultry increases after a period of high rainfall, with peak AIV risk two years after the onset of the high-rainfall period. This is presumably triggered by increased rates of waterbird breeding and consequent higher proportions of immunologically naive juvenile waterbirds entering the population directly after major rainfall events, which subsequently aggregate near permanent water bodies when the landscape dries out.
32	34474531	Plasma metabolites associated with physiological and biochemical indexes indicate the effect of caging stress on mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Zheng C, Wu Y, Liang ZH, Pi JS, Cheng SB, Wei WZ, Liu JB, Lu LZ, Zhang H	Anim Biosci	 2022 Feb;35(2):224-235	 doi: 105713/ab210241 Epub 2021 Aug 25	OBJECTIVE: Cage rearing has critical implications for the laying duck industry because it is convenient for feeding and management. However, caging stress is a type of chronic stress that induces maladaptation. Environmental stress responses have been extensively studied, but no detailed information is available about the comprehensive changes in plasma metabolites at different stages of caging stress in ducks. We designed this experiment to analyze the effects of caging stress on performance parameters and oxidative stress indexes in ducks. METHODS: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) was used to determine the changes in metabolites in duck plasma at 5 (CR5), 10 (CR10), and 15 (CR15) days after cage rearing and traditional breeding (TB). The associated pathways of differentially altered metabolites were analyzed using Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that caging stress decreased performance parameters, and the plasma total superoxide dismutase levels were increased in the CR10 group compared with the other groups. In addition, 1,431 metabolites were detected. Compared with the TB group, 134, 381, and 190 differentially produced metabolites were identified in the CR5, CR10, and CR15 groups, respectively. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) show that the selected components sufficiently distinguish the TB group and CR10 group. KEGG analysis results revealed that the differentially altered metabolites in duck plasma from the CR5 and TB groups were mainly associated with ovarian steroidogenesis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and phenylalanine metabolism. CONCLUSION: In this study, the production performance, blood indexes, number of metabolites and PCA were compared to determine effect of the caging stress stage on ducks. We inferred from the experimental results that caging-stressed ducks were in the sensitive phase in the first 5 days after caging, caging for approximately 10 days was an important transition phase, and then the duck continually adapted.

Sadaf T, Javid A, Hussain A, Bukhari SM, Hussain SM, Ain Q, Ashraf S, Suleman S, Saleem M, Azam SM, Ahmad U, Ali W	Braz J Biol	 2021 Aug 27;83:e246229	 doi: 101590/1519-6984246229 eCollection 2021	During this one year study, blood and fecal samples of doves (Zenaida asiatica), ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), pigeons (Columba livia), partridges (Alectoris chukar), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and goose (Chen caerulescens) were collected to assess the parasitic prevalence in these birds. The birds were kept at Avian Conservation and Research Center, Department of Wildlife and Ecology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore. All these avian species were kept in separate cages and their entire body was inspected on regularly basis to record external parasites. For internal parasites, 100 blood and 100 fecal samples for each species were analyzed. During present study, two species of ectoparasites i.e. fowl ticks (Args persicus) and mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) while 17 species of endoparasites; three from blood and 14 from fecal samples were identified. Prevalence of blood parasites was Plasmodium juxtanucleare 29.3%, Aegyptinella pullorum 15% and Leucoctoyzoon simond 13%. Parasitic species recorded from fecal samples included 6 species of nematodes viz. Syngamus trachea with parasitic prevalence of 50%, Capillaria anatis 40%, Capillaria annulata 37.5%, Heterakis gallinarum 28.3%, Ascardia galli 24% and Allodpa suctoria 2%. Similarly, two species of trematodes viz. Prosthogonimus ovatus having parasitic prevalence of 12.1% and Prosthogonimus macrorchis 9.1% were also recorded from fecal samples of the birds. Single cestode species Raillietina echinobothrida having parasitic prevalence of 27% and 3 protozoan species i.e. Eimeria maxima having prevalence 20.1%, Histomonas meleagridis 8% and Giardia lamblia 5.3% were recorded. In our recommendation, proper medication and sanitation of the bird's houses and cages is recommended to avoid parasites.
34	34460868	Avian influenza A virus susceptibility, infection, transmission, and antibody kinetics in European starlings.	Ellis JW, Root JJ, McCurdy LM, Bentler KT, Barrett NL, VanDalen KK, Dirsmith KL, Shriner SA	PLoS Pathog	 2021 Aug 30;17(8):e1009879	 doi: 101371/journalppat1009879 eCollection 2021 Aug	Avian influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose risks to public, agricultural, and wildlife health. Bridge hosts are spillover hosts that share habitat with both maintenance hosts (e.g., mallards) and target hosts (e.g., poultry). We conducted a comprehensive assessment of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a common visitor to both urban and agricultural environments, to assess whether this species might act as a potential maintenance or bridge host for IAVs. First, we experimentally inoculated starlings with a wild bird IAV to investigate susceptibility and replication kinetics. Next, we evaluated whether IAV might spill over to starlings from sharing resources with a widespread IAV reservoir host. We accomplished this using a specially designed transmission cage to simulate natural environmental transmission by exposing starlings to water shared with IAV-infected mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We then conducted a contact study to assess intraspecies transmission between starlings. In the initial experimental infection study, all inoculated starlings shed viral RNA and seroconverted. All starlings in the transmission study became infected and shed RNA at similar levels. All but one of these birds seroconverted, but detectable antibodies were relatively transient, falling to negative levels in a majority of birds by 59 days post contact. None of the contact starlings in the intraspecies transmission experiment became infected. In summary, we demonstrated that starlings may have the potential to act as IAV bridge hosts if they share water with IAV-infected waterfowl. However, starlings are unlikely to act as maintenance hosts due to limited, if any, intraspecies transmission. In addition, starlings have a relatively brief antibody response which should be considered when interpreting serology from field samples. Further study is needed to evaluate the potential for transmission from starlings to poultry, a possibility enhanced by starling's behavioral trait of forming very large flocks which can descend on poultry facilities when natural resources are scarce.
35	34426624	Occurrence of Mycoplasma spp. in wild birds: phylogenetic analysis and potential factors affecting distribution.	Sawicka-Durkalec A, Kursa O, Bednarz L, Tomczyk G	Sci Rep	 2021 Aug 23;11(1):17065	 doi: 101038/s41598-021-96577-0	Different Mycoplasma species have been reported in avian hosts. However, the majority of studies focus on one particular species of Mycoplasma or one host. In our research, we screened a total of 1141 wild birds representing 55 species, 26 families, and 15 orders for the presence of mycoplasmas by conventional PCR based on the 16S rRNA gene. Selected PCR products were sequenced to perform the phylogenetic analysis. All mycoplasma-positive samples were tested for M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae, which are considered the major pathogens of commercial poultry. We also verified the influence of ecological characteristics of the tested bird species including feeding habits, habitat types, and movement patterns. The presence of Mycoplasma spp. was confirmed in 498 birds of 29 species, but none of the tested birds were positive for M. gallisepticum or M. synoviae. We found possible associations between the presence of Mycoplasma spp. and all investigated ecological factors. The phylogenetic analysis showed a high variability of Mycoplasma spp.; however, some clustering of sequences was observed regarding particular bird species. We found that wild migratory waterfowl, particularly the white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) could be reservoirs and vectors of mycoplasmas pathogenic to commercial waterfowl.
36	34421865	Dual Transcriptomic Analyses Unveil Host-Pathogen Interactions Between Salmonella enterica Serovar Enteritidis and Laying Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Zhang Y, Song L, Hou L, Cao Z, Vongsangnak W, Zhu G, Xu Q, Chen G	Front Microbiol	 2021 Aug 5;12:705712	 doi: 103389/fmicb2021705712 eCollection 2021	Salmonella enteritidis (SE) is a pathogen that can readily infect ovarian tissues and colonize the granulosa cell layer such that it can be transmitted via eggs from infected poultry to humans in whom it can cause food poisoning. Ducks are an important egg-laying species that are susceptible to SE infection, yet the host-pathogen interactions between SE and ducks have not been thoroughly studied to date. Herein, we performed dual RNA-sequencing analyses of these two organisms in a time-resolved infection model of duck granulosa cells (dGCs) by SE. In total, 10,510 genes were significantly differentially expressed in host dGCs, and 265 genes were differentially expressed in SE over the course of infection. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of dGCs were enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway via KEGG analyses, and the DEGs in SE were enriched in the two-component system, bacterial secretion system, and metabolism of pathogen factors pathways as determined. A subsequent weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway is mostly enriched at 6 h post-infection (hpi). Moreover, a number of pathogenic factors identified in the pathogen-host interaction database (PHI-base) are upregulated in SE, including genes encoding the pathogenicity island/component, type III secretion, and regulators of systemic infection. Furthermore, an intracellular network associated with the regulation of SE infection in ducks was constructed, and 16 cytokine response-related dGCs DEGs (including IL15, CD40, and CCR7) and 17 pathogenesis-related factors (including sseL, ompR, and fliC) were identified, respectively. Overall, these results not only offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions between SE and ducks, but they may also aid in the selection of potential targets for antimicrobial drug development.
37	34358313	A PRECIS AND CHECKLIST OF HELMINTH PARASITES FOR 14 SPECIES OF WATERFOWL FROM THE CHIHUAHUA DESERT IN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO.	Canaris AG, Lehker MW	J Parasitol	 2021 Jul 1;107(4):621-629	 doi: 101645/19-41	A precis of helminth parasite infections and a host-parasite checklist are presented for the following 14 species of waterfowl from the Chihuahua Desert in the United States and Mexico: Chen rossii, Chen caerulescens, Anas platyrhynchos, Anas diazi, Anas acuta, Anas strepera, Anas americana, Anas clypeata, Anas cyanoptera, Anas crecca, Bucephala albeola, Oxyura jamaicensis, Fulica americana, and Podiceps nigricollis. There was a total of 127 species of helminths recovered from the 14 species of waterfowl. Total abundance, which included data available for 12 species of waterfowl, was 134,202 (mean = 11,184, median = 1,376, and 95% confidence limit [CL] = 14,485). Mean species richness ranged from 1.5 in Ross's goose, C. rossii, to 4.3 in the bufflehead, B. albeola. Host mean abundance ranged from 7.5 in the Mexican duck, A. diazi, and green-winged teal, A. crecca, to a high of 811 for the ruddy duck, O. jamaicensis. Ninety-one percent of the helminth species were generalists. Most specialists were associated with the American coot, F. americana (7), and the eared grebe, P. nigricollis (5). Percent helminth species contribution was cestodes 45%, nematodes 25%, trematodes 22%, and acanthocephalans 8%. The most commonly occurring helminth species among the 14 host species were the trematode Notocotylus attenuatus (12), the cestode Cloacotaenia megalops (10), the acanthocephalan Corynosoma constrictum (9), and the nematode Capillaria anatis (6). Low ingestion of invertebrates may have contributed to the lower number of helminth species and abundance in wintering and spring dabbling ducks (Anatini). Wild dabbling ducks ranging in age from 6 mo to 8 yr and 8 mo were infected with helminth parasites. Helminth parasite data from resident and nesting hosts and pre-fledged young birds indicated as many as 43 helminth life cycles may be occurring in the Chihuahua Desert. Host-parasite species checklists are included.
38	34339137	An Uncommon Case of Trueperella pyogenes Infection in an Adult Backyard Rooster and a Retrospective Study; 2000-20.	da Silva AP, Shivaprasad HL, Jerry C, Stoute S	Avian Dis	 2021 Mar;65(1):171-176	 doi: 101637/aviandiseases-D-20-00125	Trueperella pyogenes is an opportunistic Gram-positive bacterium that induces purulent lesions and abscesses in cattle, small ruminants, and swine. In birds, T. pyogenes infections have been linked to lameness and osteomyelitis in turkeys (Phasianidae) and hepatic fibriscess in turkeys and pigeons (Columbidae). An 18-mo-old backyard rooster with a history of progressive emaciation was submitted to the California Animal Health and Food Safety (CAHFS) laboratory system. At necropsy, unusual numerous miliary granulomas were identified, primarily in the spleen, but granulomas were also observed in air sacs and lungs. Microscopically, few to moderate numbers of granulomas with giant cells were observed in the spleen, lung, air sacs, and crop composed of necrosis and mixed inflammatory cell inflammation including multinucleated giant cells, fibrin deposition, and fibrosis. Trueperella pyogenes was isolated from the air sacs and trachea. Avibacterium paragallinarum PCR was positive from the tracheal swab. A retrospective analysis of CAHFS data on T. pyogenes between 2000 and 2020 identified 24 cases in avian species: chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus; 16/24), turkeys (5/24), Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus; 1/24), parrot (Psittaciformes; 1/24), and pheasant (Phasianidae; 1/24). Although T. pyogenes infection in birds is rare, the clinical signs and gross lesions might be indistinguishable from avian mycobacteriosis in some cases and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
39	34330207	A chromosome-level genome assembly of Cairina moschata and comparative genomic analyses.	Jiang F, Jiang Y, Wang W, Xiao C, Lin R, Xie T, Sung WK, Li S, Jakovlic I, Chen J, Du X	BMC Genomics	 2021 Jul 30;22(1):581	 doi: 101186/s12864-021-07897-4	BACKGROUND: The Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) is an economically important duck species, with favourable growth and carcass composition parameters in comparison to other ducks. However, limited genomic resources for Muscovy duck hinder our understanding of its evolution and genetic diversity. RESULTS: We combined linked-reads sequencing technology and reference-guided methods for de novo genome assembly. The final draft assembly was 1.12 Gbp with 29 autosomes, one sex chromosome and 4,583 unlocalized scaffolds with an N50 size of 77.35 Mb. Based on universal single-copy orthologues (BUSCO), the draft genome assembly completeness was estimated to be 93.30 %. Genome annotation identified 15,580 genes, with 15,537 (99.72 %) genes annotated in public databases. We conducted comparative genomic analyses and found that species-specific and rapidly expanding gene families (compared to other birds) in Muscovy duck are mainly involved in Calcium signaling, Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and GnRH signaling pathways. In comparison to the common domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos), we identified 104 genes exhibiting strong signals of adaptive evolution (Ka/Ks > 1). Most of these genes were associated with immune defence pathways (e.g. IFNAR1 and TLR5). This is indicative of the existence of differences in the immune responses between the two species. Additionally, we combined divergence and polymorphism data to demonstrate the "faster-Z effect" of chromosome evolution. CONCLUSIONS: The chromosome-level genome assembly of Muscovy duck and comparative genomic analyses provide valuable resources for future molecular ecology studies, as well as the evolutionary arms race between the host and influenza viruses.
40	34323380	Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N2 (clade 2.3.4.4) challenge of mallards age appropriate to the 2015 midwestern poultry outbreak.	Hall JS, Grear DA, Krauss S, Seiler JP, Dusek RJ, Nashold SW, Webster RG	Influenza Other Respir Viruses	 2021 Nov;15(6):767-777	 doi: 101111/irv12886 Epub 2021 Jul 29	BACKGROUND: The 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 outbreak in upper midwestern U.S. poultry operations was not detected in wild birds to any great degree during the outbreak, despite wild waterfowl being implicated in the introduction, reassortment, and movement of the virus into North America from Asia. This outbreak led to the demise of over 50 million domestic birds and occurred mainly during the northward spring migration of adult avian populations. OBJECTIVES: There have been no experimental examinations of the pathogenesis, transmission, and population impacts of this virus in adult wild waterfowl with varying exposure histories-the most relevant age class. METHODS: We captured, housed, and challenged adult wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with HPAIV H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 and measured viral infection, viral excretion, and transmission to other mallards. RESULTS: All inoculated birds became infected and excreted moderate amounts of virus, primarily orally, for up to 14 days. Cohoused, uninoculated birds also all became infected. Serological status had no effect on susceptibility. There were no obvious clinical signs of disease, and all birds survived to the end of the study (14 days). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, adult mallards are viable hosts of HPAIV H5N2 regardless of prior exposure history and are capable of transporting the virus over short and long distances. These findings have implications for surveillance efforts. The capture and sampling of wild waterfowl in the spring, when most surveillance programs are not operating, are important to consider in the design of future HPAIV surveillance programs.
41	34296480	Evaluation of a two-season banding program to estimate and model migratory bird survival.	Devers PK, Emmet RL, Boomer GS, Zimmerman GS, Royle JA	Ecol Appl	 2021 Oct;31(7):e02425	 doi: 101002/eap2425 Epub 2021 Aug 24	The management of North American waterfowl is predicated on long-term, continental-scale banding implemented prior to the hunting season (i.e., July-September) and subsequent reporting of bands recovered by hunters. However, single-season banding and encounter operations have a number of characteristics that limit their application to estimating demographic rates and evaluating hypothesized limiting factors throughout the annual cycle. We designed and implemented a two-season banding program for American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes), Mallards (A. platyrhynchos), and hybrids in eastern North America to evaluate potential application to annual life cycle conservation and sport harvest management. We assessed model fit and compared estimates of annual survival among data types (i.e., pre-hunting season only [July-September], post-hunting season only [January-March], and two-season [pre- and post-hunting season]) to evaluate model assumptions and potential application to population modeling and management. There was generally high agreement between estimates of annual survival derived using two-season and pre-season only data for all age and sex cohorts. Estimates of annual survival derived from post-season banding data only were consistently higher for adult females and juveniles of both sexes. We found patterns of seasonal survival varied by species, age, and to a lesser extent, sex. Hunter recovered birds exhibited similar spatial distributions regardless of banding season suggesting banded samples were from the same population. In contrast, goodness-of-fit tests suggest this assumption was statistically violated in some regions and years. We conclude that estimates of seasonal and annual survival for Black Ducks and Mallards based on the two-season banding program are valid and accurate based on model fit statistics, similarity in survival estimates across data and models, and similarities in the distribution of recoveries. The two-season program provides greater precision and insight into the survival process and will improve the ability of researchers and managers to test competing hypotheses regarding population regulation resulting in more effective management.
42	34277337	Sarcocystis rileyi (Apicomplexa) in Anas platyrhynchos in Europe with a potential for spread.	Zuo S, Sorensen SR, Kania PW, Buchmann K	Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl	 2021 Jul 2;15:270-275	 doi: 101016/jijppaw202106007 eCollection 2021 Aug	Four specimens of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) shot by local hunters (December 2020 to January 2021 along the eastern coastline of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea) were diagnosed with a heavy load of sarcocysts in the musculature. Morphometric and molecular diagnosis based on rDNA (18 S, ITS1, 28 S) of parasites recovered from two of the birds revealed the causative pathogen to be Sarcocystis rileyi. We further present novel sequences for the entire 5.8 S and ITS2 for this species. Elongate cysts (mean length 5.25 (SD 0.6) mm, width 1.37 (SD 0.2) mm) were recorded in all parts of the striated skeletal musculature of the birds. The main part (72%) of the 2585 cysts in one female mallard was located in the outer superficial pectoral musculature, with 11% in the inner pectoral musculature. Minor but significant parts were found in the dorsal, ventral abdominal, neck and head, legs, hand and arm (wing) musculature. No cysts were found in the smooth musculature. Each cyst contained a median of 3.2 mio bradyzoites indicating that more than 8 billion bradyzoites are available for infection of one or more predators/scavengers ingesting the bird. Bradyzoites (median length 13.5 mum (range 12.1-14.5) and median width 2.66 mum (range 2.1-3.3)) were highly resistant to proteinase treatment, which secures the passage through the stomach of the predator to its intestine where wall penetration takes place. One of the birds was ringed (tagged) in Sweden Island Oland in the Baltic Sea two years before being shot. This is documenting immigration of mallards from northern locations. The parasite species was originally described in North America in 1893 and was commonly reported in this region during the 20th century but not in Europe. Recent cases from Norway, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, UK and Hungary suggest that the species may be spreading geographically. Experienced duck hunters with a 40 years record of hunting on the island reported that this type of infection unprecedented. The final host is reported to be canines (fox, raccoon dog), skunk and mustelids, including ermines and American mink. Presence of these hosts in Europe may allow establishment of the life cycle and further colonization of the local duck populations which calls for implementation of a survey program in Europe.
43	34198498	Dietary Curcumin Alleviated Acute Ileum Damage of Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) Induced by AFB1 through Regulating Nrf2-ARE and NF-kappaB Signaling Pathways.	Jin S, Yang H, Jiao Y, Pang Q, Wang Y, Wang M, Shan A, Feng X	Foods	 2021 Jun 14;10(6)	 pii: foods10061370 doi: 103390/foods10061370	Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a stable toxic metabolite threatening health of human and animal and widely contaminated animal feed and human food. This present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary curcumin on ileum injury in ducks induced by AFB1 administration and explore its underlying mechanisms. Ducks (N = 450, one-day-old male) with a similar weight were randomly assigned to 3 groups, containing the control group, AFB1 group (60 mug AFB1 kg(-1) body weight) and curcumin (500 mg curcumin kg(-1) diet) + AFB1 group. AFB1 administration markedly increased the ileum damage, AFB1-DNA adducts in the plasma and oxidation stress and inflammation. Adding curcumin into diet protected the ileum against morphology damage induced by AFB1 administration, decreased AFB1-DNA adducts in the plasma and eliminated oxidation stress and inflammation in the ileum of ducks. Anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin could protect the ileum against acute damage via activating Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway and inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Conclusively, curcumin was a dietary anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation agent via activating Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway and inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway to protect ileum against acute damage induced by AFB1 administration.
44	34188813	Nocturnal incubation recess and flushing behavior by duck hens.	Croston R, Peterson SH, Hartman CA, Herzog MP, Feldheim CL, Casazza ML, Ackerman JT	Ecol Evol	 2021 May 1;11(12):7292-7301	 doi: 101002/ece37561 eCollection 2021 Jun	Incubating birds must balance the needs of their developing embryos with their own physiological needs, and many birds accomplish this by taking periodic breaks from incubation. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and gadwall (Mareca strepera) hens typically take incubation recesses in the early morning and late afternoon, but recesses can also take place at night. We examined nocturnal incubation recess behavior for mallard and gadwall hens nesting in Suisun Marsh, California, USA, using iButton temperature dataloggers and continuous video monitoring at nests. Fourteen percent of all detected incubation recesses (N = 13,708) were nocturnal and took place on 20% of nest-days (N = 8,668). Video monitoring showed that hens covered their eggs with down feathers when they initiated a nocturnal recess themselves as they would a diurnal recess, but they left the eggs uncovered in 94% of the nocturnal recesses in which predators appeared at nests. Thus, determining whether or not eggs were left uncovered during a recess can provide strong indication whether the recess was initiated by the hen (eggs covered) or a predator (eggs uncovered). Because nest temperature decreased more rapidly when eggs were left uncovered versus covered, we were able to characterize eggs during nocturnal incubation recesses as covered or uncovered using nest temperature data. Overall, we predicted that 75% of nocturnal recesses were hen-initiated recesses (eggs covered) whereas 25% of nocturnal recesses were predator-initiated recesses (eggs uncovered). Of the predator-initiated nocturnal recesses, 56% were accompanied by evidence of depredation at the nest during the subsequent nest monitoring visit. Hen-initiated nocturnal recesses began later in the night (closer to morning) and were shorter than predator-initiated nocturnal recesses. Our results indicate that nocturnal incubation recesses occur regularly (14% of all recesses) and, similar to diurnal recesses, most nocturnal recesses (75%) are initiated by the hen rather than an approaching predator.
45	34152291	Morphological and complete mitogenomic characterisation of the acanthocephalan Polymorphus minutus infecting the duck Anas platyrhynchos.	Sarwar H, Zhao WT, Kibet CJ, Sitko J, Nie P	Folia Parasitol (Praha)	 2021 Jun 1;68	 doi: 1014411/fp2021015	Morphological characteristics of the acanthocephalan Polymorphus minutus (Goeze, 1782), which was collected from the duck Anas platyrhynchos Linnaeus in the Czech Republic, are described. The mitochondrial (mt) genome of P. minutus was sequenced, with a total length of 14,149 bp, comprising 36 genes including 12 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and two ribosomal RNA genes (rrnL and rrnS). This genome is similar to the mt genomes of other syndermatan species. All these genes were encoded on the same DNA strand and in the same orientation. The overall nucleotide composition of the P. minutus mt genome was 38.2% T, 27.3% G, 26.2% A, and 8.3% C. The amino acid sequences of 12 PCGs for mt genomes of 28 platyzoans, including P. minutus, were used for phylogenetic analysis, and the resulting topology recovers P. minutus as sister to Southwellina hispida (Van Cleave, 1925), and the two taxa form a sister clade to Centrorhynchus aluconis (Muller, 1780) and Plagiorhynchus transversus (Rudolphi, 1819), which are all species in the Palaeacanthocephala, thus supporting the monophyly of this class.
46	34142323	Molecular characterization of Toll-like receptor type-3 in mallard duck and its response to Newcastle disease virus infection.	Elfeil WK, Abouelmaatti RR, Talat S, Fawzy M, Rady M, Diab M, Alkahtani S, Sultan H, Sun C, Lei L, Han W, Sedeik M, Abdel-Daim MM	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	 2021 Oct;28(39):55786-55795	 doi: 101007/s11356-021-14759-9 Epub 2021 Jun 18	Toll-like receptors (TLRs), type I transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), are composed of the extracellular domain that is implicated in the recognition of microbial products and initiates the innate and adaptive immune response. Previous reports on TLRs in birds showed significant levels of inter- and intraspecific genetic variation. Little is known about the structure and function of the avian immune system, especially waterfowl species. This work aimed to identify and clone Anas platyrhynchos (mallard duck) TLR-3 (dTLR-3) and its expression level following challenge with velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model for waterfowl species. The mallard duck TLR-3 full-length cDNA sequence had been cloned, which consisted of 2457 nucleotides. The translated amino acid sequence showed identity degree as 97% with Muscovy duck, 95% with geese, 89% with helmeted guineafowls, 88% with the chickens TLR-3 gene, 82% with turkey TLR-3, and 79% with zebra finch, while it showed 54% with human one; the analysis data suggested that the new sequence is probably homologous to vertebrates' TLR-3. The predicted protein encoded by the duck dTLR-3 mRNA sequence is composed of 819 amino acids. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that dTLR-3 has typical structural features and contains the main components of proteins in the TLR family. The dTLR-3 expressed in almost all examined tissues of mallard duck following quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis and using B-actin as a housekeeping gene. To check the functionality of the receptor and its role in viral infection, we evaluate the expression level in different tissues and its changes following NDV infection. The results showed significant (P < 0.05) upregulated in the brain at 24 h (1.84-fold), reached a peak at 48 h (4.82-fold), and recovered to normal levels at 72 h post-infection. These results indicate a complete and functional dTLR-3 that is orthologous to other vertebrate receptors with its potential role in early response against viral infection in mallard duck species.
47	34116495	Effects of dietary resveratrol supplementation on the chemical composition, oxidative stability and meat quality of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Jin S, Pang Q, Yang H, Diao X, Shan A, Feng X	Food Chem	 2021 Nov 30;363:130263	 doi: 101016/jfoodchem2021130263 Epub 2021 Jun 1	The effects of dietary resveratrol (0, 300, 400 and 500 mg/kg) on the chemical composition, antioxidative capacity, meat quality and volatile compound concentrations of duck meat were investigated. The results showed that dietary resveratrol had no significant effects on the chemical composition. Dietary resveratrol supplementation increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase activity, pH15 min, pH24 h and color, and reduced the malondialdehyde, and carbonyl contents and shear force, thereby improving water mobility and distribution (T2b, T21, T22), drip loss, cooking loss and volatile compounds concentration of duck meat. In conclusion, dietary resveratrol supplementation improved the meat quality of ducks by enhancing the antioxidant capacity, improving the color and shear force, and suppressing lipid and protein oxidation, and 500 mg/kg dietary resveratrol had the greatest effect in this study.

Assis JCA, Lopez-Hernandez D, Favoretto S, Medeiros LB, Melo AL, Martins NRS, Pinto HA	Parasitology	 2021 Sep;148(11):1383-1391	 doi: 101017/S0031182021000986 Epub 2021 Jun 9	Typhlocoelum cucumerinum is a tracheal parasite of birds widely distributed across the globe. Nevertheless, aspects of the biology of this cyclocoelid are still poorly understood. Herein, we report the finding of T. cucumerinum in definitive and intermediate hosts from an urban waterbody of Brazil. The parasite was initially detected during the necropsy of domestic Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) found dead in the locality. Coproparasitological tests in live animals revealed that 12/47 (25.53%) Muscovy ducks and 2/8 (25%) mallards (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) were infected with T. cucumerinum. Moreover, rediae and metacercariae morphologically similar to T. cucumerinum were found in 3/248 (1.33%) Biomphalaria straminea collected in the same waterbody frequented by the birds. The conspecificity between the adult and the larval stages was confirmed molecularly (100% similarity in Cox-1). Moreover, the phylogenetic position of T. cucumerinum was determined for the first time based on partial fragments of the 28S, Cox-1 and Nad-1 genes. The species grouped with other members of the subfamily Typhlocoelinae with sequences available, but the data obtained do not support the distinctiveness of the genera Typhlocoelum and Tracheophilus. Further studies involving a broader range of species can result in taxonomic rearrangements in Typhlocoelinae.
49	34076170	Interspecific variations in external and internal egg quality among various captive avian species from Punjab, Pakistan.	Sadaf T, Rashid M, Hussain A, Mahmud A, Bukhari SM, Noor R, Mustafa G, Saleem M, Ali A, Ashraf S, Ali W, Javid A	Braz J Biol	 2021 May 28;82:e245261	 doi: 101590/1519-6984245261 eCollection 2021	Present study was planned to determine variations in external and internal quality egg parameters of different avian species including ostrich Struthio camelus, ducks Anas platyrhynchos, chicken Gallus gallus, turkeys Meleagris gallopavo and grey francolin Francolinus pondicerinus. All the birds were kept under similar rearing conditions. A total of 150 eggs were collected for each species to record external features of these eggs. Statistically significant (p<0.05) variations were recorded in egg weight, egg length and egg width between ostrich, ducks, chicken, turkey and quail eggs. Significantly (p<0.05) higher egg weight, egg length and egg width was observed for ostrich eggs while the same was lowest for grey francolin eggs. Similarly, significantly (p<0.05) greater shape index and egg volume values were observed for ostrich eggs while lowest shape index values were recorded for turkey eggs and egg volume was lowest for grey francolin. Significantly, higher (p<0.05) values of egg density were noted for eggs of the quail and the same were lowest for ostrich eggs. Non-significant variations in egg density values were observed between eggs of the ducks, chicken, turkey and grey francolin. It has been concluded that the positive correlations between the internal and external egg quality traits indicated that the traits can be improved through selection.

Jax E, Muller I, Borno S, Borlinghaus H, Eriksson G, Fricke E, Timmermann B, Pendl H, Fiedler W, Klein K, Schreiber F, Wikelski M, Magor KE, Kraus RHS	Sci Rep	 2021 May 24;11(1):10815	 doi: 101038/s41598-021-90212-8	Monitoring and early detection of emerging infectious diseases in wild animals is of crucial global importance, yet reliable ways to measure immune status and responses are lacking for animals in the wild. Here we assess the usefulness of bio-loggers for detecting disease outbreaks in free-living birds and confirm detailed responses using leukocyte composition and large-scale transcriptomics. We simulated natural infections by viral and bacterial pathogens in captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), an important natural vector for avian influenza virus. We show that body temperature, heart rate and leukocyte composition change reliably during an acute phase immune response. Using genome-wide gene expression profiling of whole blood across time points we confirm that immunostimulants activate pathogen-specific gene regulatory networks. By reporting immune response related changes in physiological and behavioural traits that can be studied in free-ranging populations, we provide baseline information with importance to the global monitoring of zoonotic diseases.
51	34020141	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of duck CCCH-type zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP).	Zhang R, He Y, Zhu X, Wen G, Luo Q, Zhang T, Lu Q, Liu S, Xiao S, Fang L, Shao H	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	 2021 Jul 5;561:52-58	 doi: 101016/jbbrc202105019 Epub 2021 May 18	This is the first study to clone duck CCCH-type zinc finger antiviral protein (duZAP) from Jingjiang duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Full-length duZAP cDNA was 2154 bp and encoded a 717-amino acid polypeptide containing four highly conserved CCCH-type finger motifs, a WWE domain and a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) domain. duZAP was expressed in multiple duck tissues, with the highest mRNA expression in the spleen. Overexpression of duZAP in duck embryo fibroblast cells (DEFs) led to activation of the transcription factors IRF1 and NF-kappaB, and induction of IFN-beta. Analysis of deletion mutants revealed that both the WWE and PARP domains of duZAP were essential for activating the IFN-beta promoter. Knockdown of duZAP in DEFs significantly reduced poly (I:C)- and duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV)-induced IFN-beta activation. Our findings further the understanding of the role of duZAP in the duck innate immune response.
52	33997340	Effect of hybrid rice varieties on growth and development of broilers and ducks.	LeMieux FM, Villemarette CP, Lyons EK, Shields TH, German N	Anim Nutr	 2021 Mar;7(1):127-133	 doi: 101016/janinu202006004 Epub 2020 Nov 14	Three experiments (Exp. 1, n = 144 broilers [Ross x Ross]; Exp. 2, n = 118 mallard ducklings [Anas platyrhynchos]; and Exp. 3, n = 75 mature mallard ducks) were conducted to determine the effects of 3 levels of unmilled hybrid rice on growth performance and organ and gastrointestinal tract development. The dietary treatments were 1) corn-soybean meal (basal), 2) basal + 5% hybrid rice, and 3) basal + 10% hybrid rice for Exp. 1 to 3, respectively. One bird from each pen in Exp. 1 (n = 24) and all the birds in Exp. 2 (n = 118) and Exp. 3 (n = 75) were randomly selected and euthanized to determine linear measurements and organ and gastrointestinal tract weight. In Exp. 1 and 2, birds fed 10% rice experienced slower growth (P < 0.05) than birds fed the basal diet. In Exp. 3, the addition of rice did not affect growth performance. Rice addition did not affect organ length or weight (P > 0.05) in Exp. 1. However, birds fed 5% rice had significantly increased (P < 0.05) pancreas, ileum, and jejunum weights in Exp. 2, and 10% rice significantly increased (P < 0.05) liver weight in Exp. 3. The addition of 10% unmilled rice to broiler and duck diets may reduce growth performance.
53	33919914	Ontogeny of OPN4, OPN5, GnRH and GnIH mRNA Expression in the Posthatch Male and Female Pekin Duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) Suggests OPN4 May Have Additional Functions beyond Reproduction.	Van Wyk B, Fraley G	Animals (Basel)	 2021 Apr 14;11(4)	 pii: ani11041121 doi: 103390/ani11041121	The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) is known to be regulated by daylength through the deep brain photoreceptor (DBP) system. The post-hatch ontogeny is not known for any of the DBPs. We set out to determine the ontogeny of OPN4 and OPN5 gene expression relative to GnRH and GnIH using qRT-PCR. Brains and serum were collected from five drakes and five hens on the day of hatching (Day 0) and again at 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 19, 25 and 31 weeks of age and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Hen and drake serum was assayed for circulating levels of estradiol and testosterone, respectively. Data were analyzed between sexes over time using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA. Interestingly, the results show that on the day of hatching (Day 0), ducks showed adult-like levels of relative OPN4, but not OPN5, gene expression. During week 10, DBP levels increased, achieving highest relative expression levels at week 19 that maintained through week 31, typically peak fertility in ducks. GnRH mRNA levels increased following the DBP expression at the onset of puberty, and gonadal steroids increased after GnRH at week 14 while estradiol preceded testosterone. GnIH mRNA levels did not appreciably change during the time course of this experiment. These observations suggest that OPN4 may be active during the peri-hatch period and may have physiological roles beyond puberty and fertility.
54	33898795	Association between human cercarial dermatitis (HCD) and the occurrence of Trichibilarizia in duck and snail in main wetlands from Mazandaran Province, northern Iran.	Kia Lashaki E, Gholami S, Fakhar M, Karamian M, Daryani A	Parasite Epidemiol Control	 2021 Mar 16;13:e00211	 doi: 101016/jparepi2021e00211 eCollection 2021 May	BACKGROUND: Avian schistosomes are considered as main causative agents of human cercarial dermatitis (HCD) in Iran. The study was conducted to determine bird schistosomes in their final and intermediate hosts, in main wetlands of Mazandaran. METHODS: A total of 255 domestic and wild ducks were collected and the infection of nasal tissues of five (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus, Aythya ferina, Cairina moschata, Anas platyrhynchos and Spatula clypeata) species were analyzed using morphological techniques. Also, 1687 freshwater snails were collected and surveyed by cercarial shedding and crushing tests. Detection of HCD was performed for the presence of clinical symptoms of itching and maculopapular rashs by physical examination. RESULTS: Of 255 ducks, in 41 (16%) infection with nasal Trichibilarizia spp. were recognized by observing eggs and/or adult worms. The most infected ducks were Anas clypeata and Anas platyrhynchos domesticus. Overall, 0.17% of snails were infected with avian schistosomes. Also, clinical examination of 951 rice farmers revealed that 588 (61.82%) of them were suffered from HCD. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that domestic ducks could play a prominent role as a reservoir host for establishing life cycle of Trichobilharzia in the area. Also, existence of domestic reservoir ducks and suitable snail hosts in ponds and paddy fields of this area, climate conditions of the wetlands in Mazandaran leads to a high incidence of HCD.

Sauvala M, Woivalin E, Kivisto R, Laukkanen-Ninios R, Laaksonen S, Stephan R, Fredriksson-Ahomaa M	Food Microbiol	 2021 Sep;98:103768	 doi: 101016/jfm2021103768 Epub 2021 Feb 19	Game birds may carry zoonotic bacteria in their intestines and transmit them to hunters through bird handling or through the handling and consumption of contaminated meat. In this study, the prevalence of foodborne bacteria was screened from game bird faeces and mallard breast meat using PCR. The sampling occurred in southern Finland from August to December during the hunting season. Isolates were characterized by multi-locus sequence typing. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria and Escherichia coli counts were used to assess the microbial contamination of mallard meat. In total, 100 woodpigeon (Columba palumbus), 101 pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), 110 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and 30 teals (Anas crecca) were screened during the hunting season. Additionally, 100 mallard breast meat samples were collected. Campylobacter and Listeria were commonly detected in the faeces and Listeria on mallard meat. L. monocytogenes of sequence types associated with human listeriosis were frequently found in game bird faeces and on mallard meat. Good hygiene during game bird handling, storing the game bird meat frozen, and proper heat treatment are important measures to minimize the health risk for hunters and consumers.
56	33849442	Analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data of ducks reveals a diverse demographic history and extensive gene flow between Southeast/South Asian and Chinese populations.	Jiang F, Lin R, Xiao C, Xie T, Jiang Y, Chen J, Ni P, Sung WK, Han J, Du X, Li S	Genet Sel Evol	 2021 Apr 13;53(1):35	 doi: 101186/s12711-021-00627-0	BACKGROUND: The most prolific duck genetic resource in the world is located in Southeast/South Asia but little is known about the domestication and complex histories of these duck populations. RESULTS: Based on whole-genome resequencing data of 78 ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and 31 published whole-genome duck sequences, we detected three geographic distinct genetic groups, including local Chinese, wild, and local Southeast/South Asian populations. We inferred the demographic history of these duck populations with different geographical distributions and found that the Chinese and Southeast/South Asian ducks shared similar demographic features. The Chinese domestic ducks experienced the strongest population bottleneck caused by domestication and the last glacial maximum (LGM) period, whereas the Chinese wild ducks experienced a relatively weak bottleneck caused by domestication only. Furthermore, the bottleneck was more severe in the local Southeast/South Asian populations than in the local Chinese populations, which resulted in a smaller effective population size for the former (7100-11,900). We show that extensive gene flow has occurred between the Southeast/South Asian and Chinese populations, and between the Southeast Asian and South Asian populations. Prolonged gene flow was detected between the Guangxi population from China and its neighboring Southeast/South Asian populations. In addition, based on multiple statistical approaches, we identified a genomic region that included three genes (PNPLA8, THAP5, and DNAJB9) on duck chromosome 1 with a high probability of gene flow between the Guangxi and Southeast/South Asian populations. Finally, we detected strong signatures of selection in genes that are involved in signaling pathways of the nervous system development (e.g., ADCYAP1R1 and PDC) and in genes that are associated with morphological traits such as cell growth (e.g., IGF1R). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide valuable information for a better understanding of the domestication and demographic history of the duck, and of the gene flow between local duck populations from Southeast/South Asia and China.
57	33834927	Presence and shedding of Chlamydia psittaci in waterfowl in a rehabilitation facility and in the wild in New Zealand.	Soon XQ, Gartrell B, Gedye K	N Z Vet J	 2021 Jul;69(4):240-246	 doi: 101080/0048016920211915212 Epub 2021 May 7	AIMS: To determine the frequency of Chlamydia psittaci infection, shedding dynamics of C. psittaci, and C. psittaci genotype diversity in waterfowl temporarily resident in a rehabilitation facility and in mallards in the wild. METHODS: Conjunctival-choanal-cloacal swabs were collected from apparently healthy captive wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos; n = 114) and paradise shelducks (Tadorna variegata; n = 10) temporarily housed at a waterfowl breeding and rehabilitation facility (Wellington, NZ) and from wild mallards in Palmerston North (n = 50), and Southland (n = 50). DNA extracted from the swabs was analysed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) high-resolution melt curve (HRM) analysis, targeting the ompA gene of C. psittaci. RESULTS: Of the captive waterfowl, 39/114 (34%) mallards and 6/10 (60%) paradise shelducks were positive for C. psittaci as were 24/100 (24%) wild mallards. All wild mallards and paradise shelducks carried only C. psittaci genotype C. In captive wild mallards, genotypes A and C, and a mixed infection of both genotypes were found. Captive wild mallards and paradise shelducks were found to be shedding 4 to 5 x 10(4) and 1 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) copies of C. psittaci DNA per swab, respectively, with wild mallards shedding 4-677 DNA copies/swab. CONCLUSIONS: Based on qPCR-HRM analysis, a high proportion of wild mallards were infected with C. psittaci but these birds were shedding only a small amount of bacterial DNA. The proportion of sampled ducks that were infected and the extent of bacterial shedding were higher in the birds in a wildlife rehabilitation facility. The major C. psittaci genotype found in the mallards and paradise shelducks was genotype C. This is the first detection of C. psittaci genotype A and co-infection of genotype A and C in ducks. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results indicate that mallards are a reservoir of C. psittaci and therefore may pose a zoonotic risk to people involved in duck hunting, wildlife care and recreational duck feeding. Mallards may also pose a transmission risk to native birds, especially in captive facilities and this has conservation implications for the management of endangered native birds.
58	33827194	ISOFLURANE RESPIRATORY ANESTHETIC INDEX IN CHICKENS (GALLUS GALLUS DOMESTICUS).	Midon M, Escobar A, Yamada DI, de Freitas PO, Minto BW, Barletta M	J Zoo Wildl Med	 2021 Apr;52(1):327-331	 doi: 101638/2020-0140	Respiratory depression from isoflurane seems to be greater in birds than in mammals. Isoflurane respiratory anesthetic index (AI) has only been evaluated in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), which indeed showed a lower AI compared to mammals, but the isoflurane AI for other avian species is not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the isoflurane AI in chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). Six adult hens were anesthetized with isoflurane for determination of the minimum anesthetic concentration (MAC) using the bracketing method. During a second anesthetic event, the isoflurane AI was determined by progressively increasing the expired fraction of isoflurane by 0.5 times MAC until apnea was achieved (ETiso-apnea). The isoflurane AI was considered the ratio between the ETiso-apnea and the MAC. Heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were continuously monitored throughout both anesthetic events. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effect model with Greenhouse-Geisser correction, followed by Tukey's test. The MAC for isoflurane was 1.18% +/- 0.09% (mean +/- SD). The ETiso-apnea was 3.31% +/- 0.34% and the isoflurane AI was 2.80 +/- 0.26. In chickens, isoflurane AI is similar to that measured in mammals, which is in contrast with published data in other avian species.
59	33796733	A species-specific triplex PCR assay for authentication of Galli Gigerii Endothelium Corneum.	Zhang Y, Li J, Yang S, Xu C, Gblinwon RT, Hu J, Sun X, Xia G, Yang H, Shen Y	Mitochondrial DNA B Resour	 2021 Mar 19;6(3):1044-1049	 doi: 101080/2380235920211899075	A triplex PCR assay was developed to identify animal species and adulteration of a natural medicine Galli Gigerii Endothelium Corneum (GGEC). Three species-specific primer sets were designed according to the difference in mitochondrial genome of Gallus gallus domesticus, Anas platyrhynchos and Anser anse. The PCR conditions were optimized and the assay was well validated for high specificity and sensitivity (1 mg/muL). Especially, when artificial adulterants made from the mixture of three species were analyzed, the assay has still exhibited strong capability of differentiation. By using this developed method, two batches out of fourteen commercial GGEC products were identified to be adulterated by Anser anse. The newly proposed assay showed sufficient merits as a regular tool for the identification of counterfeits or adulterants of GGEC product for their pulverized and processed form, and even Chinese patent medicines composed of these species.
60	33767842	Interrupted incubation: How dabbling ducks respond when flushed from the nest.	Croston R, Hartman CA, Herzog MP, Peterson SH, Kohl JD, Overton CT, Feldheim CL, Casazza ML, Ackerman JT	Ecol Evol	 2021 Feb 23;11(6):2862-2872	 doi: 101002/ece37245 eCollection 2021 Mar	Nesting birds must provide a thermal environment sufficient for egg development while also meeting self-maintenance needs. Many birds, particularly those with uniparental incubation, achieve this balance through periodic incubation recesses, during which foraging and other self-maintenance activities can occur. However, incubating birds may experience disturbances such as predator or human activity which interrupt natural incubation patterns by compelling them to leave the nest. We characterized incubating mallard Anas platyrhynchos and gadwall Mareca strepera hens' responses when flushed by predators and investigators in Suisun Marsh, California, USA. Diurnal incubation recesses initiated by investigators approaching nests were 63% longer than natural diurnal incubation recesses initiated by the hen (geometric mean: 226.77 min versus 142.04 min). Nocturnal incubation recesses, many of which were likely the result of predators flushing hens, were of similar duration regardless of whether the nest was partially depredated during the event (115.33 [101.01;131.68] minutes) or not (119.62 [111.96;127.82] minutes), yet were 16% shorter than natural diurnal incubation recesses. Hens moved further from the nest during natural diurnal recesses or investigator-initiated recesses than during nocturnal recesses, and the proportion of hen locations recorded in wetland versus upland habitat during recesses varied with recess type (model-predicted means: natural diurnal recess 0.77; investigator-initiated recess 0.82; nocturnal recess 0.31). Hens were more likely to take a natural recess following an investigator-initiated recess earlier that same day than following a natural recess earlier that same day, and natural recesses that followed an investigator-initiated recess were longer than natural recesses that followed an earlier natural recess, suggesting that hens may not fulfill all of their physiological needs during investigator-initiated recesses. We found no evidence that the duration of investigator-initiated recesses was influenced by repeated visits to the nest, whether by predators or by investigators, and trapping and handling the hen did not affect investigator-initiated recess duration unless the hen was also fitted with a backpack-harness style GPS-GSM transmitter at the time of capture. Hens that were captured and fitted with GPS-GSM transmitters took recesses that were 26% longer than recesses during which a hen was captured but a GPS-GSM transmitter was not attached. Incubation interruptions had measurable but limited and specific effects on hen behavior.
61	33736731	Helminths of the mallard Anas platyrhynchos Linnaeus, 1758 from Austria, with emphasis on the morphological variability of Polymorphus minutus Goeze, 1782.	Jirsa F, Reier S, Smales L	J Helminthol	 2021 Mar 19;95:e16	 doi: 101017/S0022149X21000079	The mallard Anas platyrhynchos is the most abundant water bird species in Austria, but there is no record of its helminth community. Therefore, this work aimed to close that gap by recording and analysing the parasite community of a large number of birds from Austria for the first time. A total of 60 specimens shot by hunters in autumn were examined for intestinal parasites. The following taxa were recovered (prevalence given in parentheses): Cestoda: Diorchis sp. (31.7%) and Fimbriarioides intermedia (1.7%); Acanthocephala: Filicollis anatis (5%), Polymorphus minutus (30%) and one cystacanth unidentified (1.7%); Trematoda: Apatemon gracilis (3.3%), Echinostoma grandis (6.7%), Echinostoma revolutum (6.7%) and Notocotylus attenuatus (23.3%); Nematoda: Porrocaecum crassum (1.7%) and one not identified (1.7%). The frequency distribution of parasites showed a typical pattern in which 39 birds (65%) were either not parasitized or were harbouring up to five worms, whereas more intense infestations occurred in a lesser number of hosts. Compared to other studies from central and eastern Europe, an extremely depauperate helminth community, particularly of the cestodes and nematodes, was found. Polymorphus minutus was observed as having highly variable morphology and, therefore, molecular genetic characterization by DNA barcoding was carried out. Species identification was confirmed by comparing data with the reference cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene sequence from P. minutus available in GenBank.
62	33735694	A visual method to detect meat adulteration by recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick.	Lin L, Zheng Y, Huang H, Zhuang F, Chen H, Zha G, Yang P, Wang Z, Kong M, Wei H, Zou X, Lin M	Food Chem	 2021 Aug 30;354:129526	 doi: 101016/jfoodchem2021129526 Epub 2021 Mar 10	Determining the animal source in meat and meat products is crucial to prevent meat adulteration and fraud. Conventional methods require considerable operator skills, expensive instruments and are unable to provide fast mobile on-site detection systems to detect contamination of meat products. We developed a visual method based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) to identify beef (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries), pork (Sus scrofa), duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and chicken (Gallus gallus). The reaction was completed within 20 min. The results were determined by the naked eye. The detection limits of the RPA-LFD assays for duck, beef, sheep, chicken and pork were 10(1)/microL, 10(2)/microL, 10(2)/microL, 10(1)/microL and 10(1)/microL, respectively. Furthermore, the RPA-LFD assays could differentiate species in boiled, microwaved, pressure-cooked or fried samples. These RPA-LFD assays represent a rapid, mobile detection system for determining meat product contamination.
63	33689826	Notocotylus ikutai n. sp. (Digenea: Notocotylidae) from lymnaeid snails and anatid birds in Hokkaido, Japan.	Sasaki M, Kobayashi M, Yoshino T, Asakawa M, Nakao M	Parasitol Int	 2021 Aug;83:102318	 doi: 101016/jparint2021102318 Epub 2021 Mar 6	An unknown species of the genus Notocotylus (Digenea: Notocotylidae) was found as the larval stage from the lymnaeid snail, Radix auricularia, in a static water area of the Chubetsu River, Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. A DNA barcoding identification system was applied to detect the adult stage. Through the inspection of anatid game birds in Hokkaido, Anas crecca, Anas platyrhynchos, Anas zonorhyncha, and Mareca penelope were demonstrated to serve as the definitive hosts. The detailed morphological features of the species were characterized using adults raised experimentally in immunosuppressed mice and naturally developed larvae in R. auricularia. Although the species is morphologically similar to Notocotylus attenuatus and Notocotylus magniovatus in both adult and larval stages, its taxonomic independence was confirmed by a comprehensive study based on molecular phylogeny, morphology, and ecology. Here we propose Notocotylus ikutai n. sp. for this species. The migratory behavior of the anatid hosts and the North-Eurasian distribution of R. auricularia suggest that the new species is widely distributed in the northern Far East.
64	33686142	Plasticity in timing of avian breeding in response to spring temperature differs between early and late nesting species.	Messmer DJ, Alisauskas RT, Poysa H, Runko P, Clark RG	Sci Rep	 2021 Mar 8;11(1):5410	 doi: 101038/s41598-021-84160-6	Plasticity for breeding dates may influence population vulnerability to climate change via phenological mismatch between an organism's life cycle requirements and resource availability in occupied environments. Some life history traits may constrain plasticity, however there have been remarkably few comparisons of how closely-related species, differing in key traits, respond to common phenology gradients. We compared population- and individual-level plasticity in clutch initiation dates (CID) in response to spring temperature among five duck species with early- to late-season nesting life histories. Plasticity was strongest in females of the earliest breeding species (common goldeneye [Bucephala clangula], mallard [Anas platyrhynchos], and gadwall [Mareca strepera]), whereas late-nesting lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and white-winged scoter (Melanitta fusca deglandi) did not respond. These results contrast with previous work in other bird families that suggested late-breeders are generally more flexible. Nevertheless, late-breeding species exhibited annual variation in mean CID, suggesting response to other environmental factors unrelated to spring temperature. Goldeneye and gadwall females varied in their strength of individual plasticity ('individual x environment' interactions) and goldeneye and scoter females showed evidence of interannual repeatability of CID. Fitness consequences of CID plasticity in response to spring phenology, including trophic mechanisms and population consequences, warrant investigation.
65	33677537	Whole-genome resequencing reveals genetic characteristics of different duck breeds from the Guangxi region in China.	Wang R, Sun J, Han H, Huang Y, Chen T, Yang M, Wei Q, Wan H, Liao Y	G3 (Bethesda)	 2021 Apr 15;11(4)	 pii: 6156632 doi: 101093/g3journal/jkab054	Distinctive indigenous duck (Anas platyrhynchos) populations of Guangxi, China, evolved due to the geographical, cultural, and environmental variability of this region. To investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of the indigenous ducks of Guangxi, 78 individuals from eight populations were collected and sequenced by whole-genome resequencing with an average depth of approximately 9.40x. The eight indigenous duck populations included four breeds and four resource populations. Moreover, the genome data of 47 individuals from two typical meat-type breeds and two native egg-type breeds were obtained from a public database. Calculation of heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity (pi), Tajima's D, and FST indicated that the Guangxi populations were characterized by higher genetic diversity and lower differentiation than meat-type breeds. The highest diversity was observed in the Xilin-Ma ducks. Principal component, structure, and phylogenetic tree analyses revealed the relationship between the indigenous duck populations of Guangxi. A mild degree of differentiation was observed among the Guangxi populations, although three populations were closer to the meat or egg breeds. Indigenous populations are famous for their special flavor, small body size, and slow growth rates. Selective sweep analysis revealed the candidate genes and pathways associated with these growth traits. Our findings provide a valuable source of information regarding genetic diversity, population conservation, and genome-associated breeding of ducks.
66	33669581	Skeletal Muscle Transcriptome Analysis of Hanzhong Ma Duck at Different Growth Stages Using RNA-Seq.	Hu Z, Cao J, Zhang J, Ge L, Zhang H, Liu X	Biomolecules	 2021 Feb 19;11(2)	 pii: biom11020315 doi: 103390/biom11020315	As one of the most important poultry worldwide, ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) are raised mainly for meat and egg products, and muscle development in ducks is important for meat production. Therefore, an investigation of gene expression in duck skeletal muscle would significantly contribute to our understanding of muscle development. In this study, twenty-four cDNA libraries were constructed from breast and leg muscles of Hanzhong Ma ducks at day 17, 21, 27 of the embryo and postnatal at 6-month-old. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics were used to determine the abundances and characteristics of transcripts. A total of 632,172,628 (average 52,681,052) and 637,213,938 (average 53,101,162) reads were obtained from the sequencing data of breast and leg muscles, respectively. Over 71.63% and 77.36% of the reads could be mapped to the Anas platyrhynchos genome. In the skeletal muscle of Hanzhong duck, intron variant (INTRON), synonymous variant (SYNONYMOUS_CODING), and prime 3' UTR variant (UTR_3_PRIME) were the main single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) annotation information, and "INTRON", "UTR_3_PRIME", and downstream-gene variant (DOWNSTREAM) were the main insertion-deletion (InDel) annotation information. The predicted number of alternative splicing (AS) in all samples were mainly alternative 5' first exon (transcription start site)-the first exon splicing (TSS) and alternative 3' last exon (transcription terminal site)-the last exon splicing (TTS). Besides, there were 292 to 2801 annotated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in breast muscle and 304 to 1950 annotated DEGs in leg muscle from different databases. It is worth noting that 75 DEGs in breast muscle and 49 DEGs in leg muscle were co-expressed at all developmental points of comparison, respectively. The RNA-Seq data were confirmed to be reliable by qPCR. The identified DEGs, such as CREBL2, RHEB, GDF6, SHISA2, MYLK2, ACTN3, RYR3, and STMN1, were specially highlighted, indicating their strong associations with muscle development in the Hanzhong Ma duck. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that regulation of actin cytoskeleton, oxidative phosphorylation, and focal adhesion were involved in the development of skeletal muscle. The findings from this study can contribute to future investigations of the growth and development mechanism in duck skeletal muscle.
67	33525657	The First Report of the Prion Protein Gene (PRNP) Sequence in Pekin Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica): The Potential Prion Disease Susceptibility in Ducks.	Jeong MJ, Kim YC, Jeong BH	Genes (Basel)	 2021 Jan 28;12(2)	 pii: genes12020193 doi: 103390/genes12020193	Pathogenic prion protein (PrP(Sc)), converted from normal prion protein (PrP(C)), causes prion disease. Although prion disease has been reported in several mammalian species, chickens are known to show strong resistance to prion diseases. In addition to chickens, the domestic duck occupies a large proportion in the poultry industry and may be regarded as a potential resistant host against prion disease. However, the DNA sequence of the prion protein gene (PRNP) has not been reported in domestic ducks. Here, we performed amplicon sequencing targeting the duck PRNP gene with the genomic DNA of Pekin ducks. In addition, we aligned the PrP sequence of the Pekin duck with that of various species using ClustalW2 and carried out phylogenetic analysis using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis X (MEGA X). We also constructed the structural modeling of the tertiary and secondary structures in avian PrP using SWISS-MODEL. Last, we investigated the aggregation propensity on Pekin duck PrP using AMYCO. We first reported the DNA sequence of the PRNP gene in Pekin ducks and found that the PrP sequence of Pekin ducks is more similar to that of geese than to that of chickens and mallards (wild ducks). Interestingly, Pekin duck PrP showed a high proportion of beta-sheets compared to that of chicken PrP, and a high aggregation propensity compared to that of avian PrPs. However, Pekin duck PrP with substitutions of chicken-specific amino acids showed reduced aggregation propensities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the genetic characteristics of the PRNP sequence in Pekin ducks.
68	33477842	Whole Genome Analysis of Environmental Pseudomonas mendocina Strains: Virulence Mechanisms and Phylogeny.	Ruiz-Roldan L, de Toro M, Saenz Y	Genes (Basel)	 2021 Jan 19;12(1)	 pii: genes12010115 doi: 103390/genes12010115	Pseudomonas mendocina is an environmental bacterium, rarely isolated in clinical specimens, although it has been described as producing endocarditis and sepsis. Little is known about its genome. Whole genome sequencing can be used to learn about the phylogeny, evolution, or pathogenicity of these isolates. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the resistome, virulome, and phylogenetic relationship of two P. mendocina strains, Ps542 and Ps799, isolated from a healthy Anas platyrhynchos fecal sample and a lettuce, respectively. Among all of the small number of P. mendocina genomes available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repository, both strains were placed within one of two well-defined phylogenetic clusters. Both P. mendocina strains lacked antimicrobial resistance genes, but the Ps799 genome showed a MOBP3 family relaxase. Nevertheless, this study revealed that P. mendocina possesses an important number of virulence factors, including a leukotoxin, flagella, pili, and the Type 2 and Type 6 Secretion Systems, that could be responsible for their pathogenesis. More phenotypical and in vivo studies are needed to deepen the association with human infections and the potential P. mendocina pathogenicity.
69	33472667	DDX1 from Cherry valley duck mediates signaling pathways and anti-NDRV activity.	Zhang H, Song X, Li T, Wang J, Xing B, Zhai X, Luo J, Hu X, Hou X, Wei L	Vet Res	 2021 Jan 20;52(1):9	 doi: 101186/s13567-020-00889-4	Novel duck reovirus (NDRV) causes severe economic losses to the duck industry, which is characterized by hemorrhagic spots and necrotic foci of the livers and spleens. DEAD-box helicase 1 (DDX1) plays a critical role in the innate immune system against viral infection. However, the role of duck DDX1 (duDDX1) in anti-RNA virus infection, especially in the anti-NDRV infection, has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of duDDX1 (2223 bp encode 740 amino acids) was firstly cloned from the spleen of healthy Cherry valley ducks, and the phylogenetic tree indicated that the duDDX1 has the closest relationship with Anas platyrhynchos in the bird branch. The duDDX1 mRNA was widely distributed in all tested tissues, especially in the duodenum, liver, and spleen. Overexpression of duDDX1 in primary duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells triggered the activation of transcription factors IRF-7 and NF-kappaB, as well as IFN-beta expression, and the expression of the Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4) was significantly increased. Importantly, after overexpressing or knocking down duDDX1 and infecting NDRV in DEF cells, duDDX1 inhibits the replication of NDRV virus and also regulates the expression of pattern recognition receptors and cytokines. This indicates that duDDX1 may play an important role in the innate immune response of ducks to NDRV. Collectively, we first cloned DDX1 from ducks and analyzed its biological functions. Secondly, we proved that duck DDX1 participates in anti-NDRV infection, and innovated new ideas for the prevention and control of duck virus infection.
70	33433322	Migratory routes, domesticated birds and cercarial dermatitis: the distribution of Trichobilharzia franki in Northern Iran.	Ashrafi K, Sharifdini M, Darjani A, Brant SV	Parasite	 2021;28:4	 doi: 101051/parasite/2020073 Epub 2021 Jan 12	BACKGROUND: One of the major migration routes for birds going between Europe and Asia is the Black Sea-Mediterranean route that converges on the Volga Delta, continuing into the area of the Caspian Sea. Cercarial dermatitis is a disorder in humans caused by schistosome trematodes that use aquatic birds and snails as hosts and is prevalent in areas of aquaculture in Northern Iran. Before the disorder can be addressed, it is necessary to determine the etiological agents and their host species. This study aimed to document whether domestic mallards are reservoir hosts and if so, to characterize the species of schistosomes. Previous work has shown that domestic mallards are reservoir hosts for a nasal schistosome. RESULTS: In 32 of 45 domestic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) (71.1%), the schistosome Trichobilharzia franki, previously reported only from Europe, was found in visceral veins. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed the species designation. These findings extend the range of T. franki from Europe to Eurasia. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of cercarial dermatitis in Iran is high in areas of aquaculture. Previous studies in the area have shown that domestic mallards are reservoir hosts of T. regenti, a nasal schistosome and T. franki, as shown in this study. The genetic results support the conclusion that populations of T. franki from Iran are not differentiated from populations in Europe. Therefore, the schistosomes are distributed with their migratory duck hosts, maintaining the gene flow across populations with compatible snail hosts in Iran.
71	33372351	A single nucleotide polymorphism variant located in the cis-regulatory region of the ABCG2 gene is associated with mallard egg colour.	Liu H, Hu J, Guo Z, Fan W, Xu Y, Liang S, Liu D, Zhang Y, Xie M, Tang J, Huang W, Zhang Q, Xi Y, Li Y, Wang L, Ma S, Jiang Y, Feng Y, Wu Y, Cao J, Zhou Z, Hou S	Mol Ecol	 2021 Mar;30(6):1477-1491	 doi: 101111/mec15785 Epub 2021 Mar 3	Avian egg coloration is shaped by natural selection, but its genetic basis remains unclear. Here, we used genome-wide association analysis and identity by descent to finely map green egg colour to a 179-kb region of Chr4 based on the resequencing of 352 ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) from a segregating population resulting from the mating of Pekin ducks (white-shelled eggs) and mallards (green-shelled eggs). We further narrowed the candidate region to a 30-kb interval by comparing genome divergence in seven indigenous duck populations. Among the genes located in the finely mapped region, only one transcript of the ABCG2 gene (XM_013093252.2) exhibited higher uterine expression in green-shelled individuals than in white-shelled individuals, as supported by transcriptome data from four populations. ABCG2 has been reported to encode a protein that functions as a membrane transporter for biliverdin. Sanger sequencing of the whole 30-kb candidate region (Chr4: 47.41-47.44 Mb) and a plasmid reporter assay helped to identify a single nucleotide polymorphism (Chr4: 47,418,074 G>A) located in a conserved predicted promoter region whose variation may alter ABCG2 transcription activity. We provide a useful molecular marker for duck breeding and contribute data to the research on ecological evolution based on egg colour patterns among birds.
72	33361418	Host Range of Influenza A Virus H1 to H16 in Eurasian Ducks Based on Tissue and Receptor Binding Studies.	Verhagen JH, Eriksson P, Leijten L, Blixt O, Olsen B, Waldenstrom J, Ellstrom P, Kuiken T	J Virol	 2021 Feb 24;95(6)	 pii: JVI01873-20 doi: 101128/JVI01873-20 Print 2021 Feb 24	Dabbling and diving ducks partly occupy shared habitats but have been reported to play different roles in wildlife infectious disease dynamics. Influenza A virus (IAV) epidemiology in wild birds has been based primarily on surveillance programs focused on dabbling duck species, particularly mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Surveillance in Eurasia has shown that in mallards, some subtypes are commonly (H1 to H7 and H10), intermediately (H8, H9, H11, and H12), or rarely (H13 to H16) detected, contributing to discussions on virus host range and reservoir competence. An alternative to surveillance in determining IAV host range is to study virus attachment as a determinant for infection. Here, we investigated the attachment patterns of all avian IAV subtypes (H1 to H16) to the respiratory and intestinal tracts of four dabbling duck species (Mareca and Anas spp.), two diving duck species (Aythya spp.), and chicken, as well as to a panel of 65 synthetic glycan structures. We found that IAV subtypes generally showed abundant attachment to colon of the Anas duck species, mallard, and Eurasian teal (Anas crecca), supporting the fecal-oral transmission route in these species. The reported glycan attachment profile did not explain the virus attachment patterns to tissues but showed significant attachment of duck-originated viruses to fucosylated glycan structures and H7 virus tropism for Neu5Gc-LN. Our results suggest that Anas ducks play an important role in the ecology and epidemiology of IAV. Further knowledge on virus tissue attachment, receptor distribution, and receptor binding specificity is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying host range and epidemiology of IAV.IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in wild birds worldwide. From wild birds, the viruses can cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadically and indirectly infect humans. A high IAV diversity has been found in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), which are most often sampled as part of surveillance programs; meanwhile, little is known about the role of other duck species in IAV ecology and epidemiology. In this study, we investigated the attachment of all avian IAV hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H1 to H16) to tissues of six different duck species and chicken as an indicator of virus host range. We demonstrated that the observed virus attachment patterns partially explained reported field prevalence. This study demonstrates that dabbling ducks of the Anas genus are potential hosts for most IAV subtypes, including those infecting poultry. This knowledge is useful to target the sampling of wild birds in nature and to further study the interaction between IAVs and birds.
73	33329501	A Comparative Study of the Innate Humoral Immune Response to Avian Influenza Virus in Wild and Domestic Mallards.	van Dijk JGB, Verhagen JH, Hegemann A, Tolf C, Olofsson J, Jarhult JD, Waldenstrom J	Front Microbiol	 2020 Nov 30;11:608274	 doi: 103389/fmicb2020608274 eCollection 2020	Domestic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) are traditionally used as a model to investigate infection dynamics and immune responses to low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) in free-living mallards. However, it is unclear whether the immune response of domestic birds reflects the response of their free-living counterparts naturally exposed to these viruses. We investigated the extent to which the innate humoral immune response was similar among (i) wild-type domestic mallards in primary and secondary infection with LPAIV H4N6 in a laboratory setting (laboratory mallards), (ii) wild-type domestic mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs in a semi-natural setting (sentinel mallards), and (iii) free-living mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs. We quantified innate humoral immune function by measuring non-specific natural antibodies (agglutination), complement activity (lysis), and the acute phase protein haptoglobin. We demonstrate that complement activity in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure was higher in primary-exposed laboratory mallards than in sentinel and free-living mallards. LPAIV H4N6 likely activated the complement system and the acute phase response in primary-exposed laboratory mallards, as lysis was higher and haptoglobin lower at day 3 and 7 post-exposure compared to baseline immune function measured prior to exposure. There were no differences observed in natural antibody and haptoglobin concentrations among laboratory, sentinel, and free-living mallards in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure. Our study demonstrates that, based on the three innate humoral immune parameters measured, domestic mallards seem an appropriate model to investigate innate immunology of their free-living counterparts, albeit the innate immune response of secondary-LPAIV exposed mallards is a better proxy for the innate immune response in pre-exposed free-living mallards than that of immunologically naive mallards.
74	33215508	Pattern-recognition receptors in duck (Anas platyrhynchos): identification, expression and function analysis of toll-like receptor 3.	Gu T, Li G, Wu X, Zeng T, Xu Q, Li L, Vladyslav S, Chen G, Lu L	Br Poult Sci	 2021 Jun;62(3):346-352	 doi: 101080/0007166820201853045 Epub 2020 Dec 7	1. Innate immunity provides the first line of defence against pathogenic organisms through a myriad of germline encoded receptors called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, as an important member of PRRs, is indispensable for host defence against viral infection by recognising virus-derived RNAs. However, little is known about the structure and function of TLR3 in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), a natural host for the avian influenza virus.2. This study cloned the full-length cDNA of duck TLR3 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA sequence of duck TLR3 was 4046 bp in length and encoded 895 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignment showed that duck TLR3 shared high similarity with that from other vertebrates.3. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis suggested that TLR3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all tissues tested, having higher levels in the kidney, liver, breast muscle, ovary and heart. After stimulation with viral- or bacterial-mimics, including LPS, poly(I:C), pam3CSK4, FLS-1, FLA-ST and R848, the TLR3 transcript was significantly upregulated. Meanwhile, overexpression of duck TLR3 significantly promoted the transcription of IFN-beta, IRF7, TRIF, Mx, STAT1 and STAT2 mRNA after stimulation with poly(I:C).4. These results suggested that TLR3 play an important role in resistance against viral and bacterial infections in ducks.
75	33207803	Prevalence and Distribution of Avian Influenza Viruses in Domestic Ducks at the Waterfowl-Chicken Interface in Wetlands.	Hassan MM, Islam A, Hasan RB, Rahman MK, Webby RJ, Hoque MA, El Zowalaty ME	Pathogens	 2020 Nov 16;9(11)	 pii: pathogens9110953 doi: 103390/pathogens9110953	Ducks are a natural reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and can act as a reassortment vessel. Wetlands, such as Hakaluki and Tanguar haor in Bangladesh, have unique ecosystems including domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) rearing, especially household and free-range ducks. A cross-sectional study was, therefore, conducted to explore avian influenza status and its distribution and risk factors in the wetland areas. During the three consecutive winters of 2015-2017, specifically in December of these years, we collected a total of 947 samples including blood, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from domestic ducks (free-range duck (n = 312 samples) and household ducks (n = 635 samples) in wetlands. We screened serum samples using a nucleoprotein competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) to estimate seroprevalence of IAV antibodies and swab samples by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect IA viral M gene. Eleven (11) M gene positive samples were subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Serological and viral prevalence rates of IAVs were 63.8% (95% CI: 60.6-66.8) and 10.7% (8.8-12.8), respectively. Serological and viral RNA prevalence rates were 51.8% (95% CI: 47.2-56.4) and 10.2% (7.6-13.3) in Hakaluki haor, 75.6% (71.5-79.4) and 11.1% (8.5-14.3) in Tanguar haor, 66.3% (62.5-69.9) and 11.2% (8.8-13.9) in household ducks and 58.7% (52.9-64.2) and 9.6% (6.5-13.4) in free-range ducks, respectively. The risk factors identified for higher odds of AI seropositive ducks were location (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 2.2-3.8, p < 0.001; Tanguar haor vs. Hakaluki haor), duck-rearing system (OR = 1.4, 1.1-1.8, household vs. free-range), farmer's education status (OR = 1.5, 1.2-2.0, p < 0.05 illiterate vs. literate) and contact type (OR = 3.0, 2.1-4.3, p < 0.001; contact with chicken vs. no contact with chicken). The risk factors identified for higher odds of AI RNA positive ducks were farmer's education status (OR = 1.5, 1.0-2.3, p < 0.05 for illiterate vs literate), contact type (OR = 2.7, 1.7-4.2, p < 0.001; ducks having contact with chicken vs. ducks having contact with waterfowl). The phylogenetic analysis of 11 partial M gene sequences suggested that the M gene sequences detected in free-range duck were very similar to each other and were closely related to the M gene sequences of previously reported highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtypes in waterfowl in Bangladesh and Southeast Asian countries. Results of the current study will help provide significant information for future surveillance programs and model IAV infection to predict the spread of the viruses among migratory waterfowl, free-range ducks and domestic poultry in Bangladesh.
76	33193588	Development and Validation of a Novel Five-Dye Short Tandem Repeat Panel for Forensic Identification of 11 Species.	Cui W, Jin X, Guo Y, Chen C, Zhang W, Wang Y, Lan J, Zhu B	Front Genet	 2020 Sep 24;11:1005	 doi: 103389/fgene202001005 eCollection 2020	Species identification of unknown biological samples is of fundamental importance for forensic applications, especially in crime detection, poaching, and illegal trade of endangered animals as well as meat fraud. In this study, a novel panel was developed to simultaneously identify 10 different animal species (Gallus domesticus, Anas platyrhynchos domesticus, Ovis aries, Sus scrofa domesticus, Bos taurus, Equus caballus, Columba livia domestica, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, and Canis lupus familiaris) and human beings by amplifying 22 short tandem repeat (STR) loci in a multiplex PCR using a set of five fluorescently labeled dyes. This novel 22-STR panel was validated by optimization of PCR conditions as well as species specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, precision, DNA mixture, and tissue/organ consistency. The results of developmental validation showed that the 22-STR loci achieved high species specificity among 10 animal species and human beings, and the sensitivity of this panel was 0.09 ng. This 22-STR panel identified different meats in mixed samples, and the minimum detected mixture ratio in the current test was 10% (0.1 ng/1 ng). This sensitive, accurate, and specific 22-STR panel can be used for forensic species identification and the detection of meat fraud and adulteration.
77	33167978	The association between SAalpha2,3Gal occurrence frequency and avian influenza viral load in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and blue-winged teals (Spatula discors).	Dolinski AC, Jankowski MD, Fair JM, Owen JC	BMC Vet Res	 2020 Nov 10;16(1):430	 doi: 101186/s12917-020-02642-7	BACKGROUND: Individual heterogeneity in pathogen load can affect disease transmission dynamics; therefore, identifying intrinsic factors responsible for variation in pathogen load is necessary for determining which individuals are prone to be most infectious. Because low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) preferentially bind to alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptors (SAalpha2,3Gal) in the intestines and bursa of Fabricius in wild ducks (Anas and Spatula spp.), we investigated juvenile mallards (Anas platyrhyncos) and blue-winged teals (Anas discors) orally inoculated with A/northern pintail/California/44221-761/2006 (H5N9) and the virus titer relationship to occurrence frequency of SAalpha2,3Gal in the intestines and bursa. To test the natural variation of free-ranging duck populations, birds were hatched and raised in captivity from eggs collected from nests of free-ranging birds in North Dakota, USA. Data generated from qPCR were used to quantify virus titers in cloacal swabs, ileum tissue, and bursa of Fabricius tissue, and lectin histochemistry was used to quantify the occurrence frequency of SAalpha2,3Gal. Linear mixed models were used to analyze infection status, species, and sex-based differences. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between virus titer and SAalpha2,3Gal occurrence frequency. RESULTS: In mallards, we found high individual variation in virus titers significantly related to high variation of SAalpha2,3Gal in the ileum. In contrast to mallards, individual variation in teals was minimal and significant relationships between virus titers and SAalpha2,3Gal were not determined. Collectively, teals had both higher virus titers and a higher occurrence frequency of SAalpha2,3Gal compared to mallards, which may indicate a positive association between viral load and SAalpha2,3Gal. Statistically significant differences were observed between infected and control birds indicating that LPAIV infection may influence the occurrence frequency of SAalpha2,3Gal, or vice versa, but only in specific tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide quantitative evidence that SAalpha2,3Gal abundance is related to LPAIV titers; thus, SAalpha2,3Gal should be considered a potential intrinsic factor influencing variation in LPAIV load.
78	33117797	Transcriptome Reveals Multi Pigmentation Genes Affecting Dorsoventral Pattern in Avian Body.	Xi Y, Liu H, Li L, Xu Q, Liu Y, Wang L, Ma S, Wang J, Bai L, Zhang R, Han C	Front Cell Dev Biol	 2020 Oct 1;8:560766	 doi: 103389/fcell2020560766 eCollection 2020	Certain animals exhibit a special dorsoventral pattern with a lighter ventral side compared to the dorsal one and this phenomenon was preserved in the long-term evolution process. Birds also retain this trait. Recently, Inaba et al. (2019) found that ASIP (agouti signal protein) regulated interconversion between different melanocyte types leads to dorsal stripe pattern, which may partly explain the birds' dorsoventral plumage color difference. In this study, we used the embryo samples of LBM (light brown mottling) ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) with white ventral and dark dorsal body parts to investigate the mechanism of dorsoventral color variation. Firstly, melanin deposition process of duck embryos was investigated. The result indicated that E13 and E16 were the active stages of melanin synthesis. Moreover, the melanin deposition on the dorsum of LBM ducks was higher than that on the ventral side throughout. Then, RNA-seq was conducted for the dorsal and ventral skin tissues from E7 (early), E13 (middle) and E19 (late) of LBM ducks. Expression pattern analysis showed that the mRNA expression of most melanin synthesis related genes were at the highest level at E13, which was consistent with the section analysis. A correlation was found between melanogenesis pathway and dorsoventral color difference by co-expression analysis. In the DEG (differentially expressed gene) analysis, we added the dorsal skin transcriptome of embryonic white and black duck of same subspecies (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) for horizontal comparison. The results showed that 8 melanogenesis related genes (TYR, TYRP1, MLANA, RAB38, OCA2, TSPAN10, MC1R, and MSLN) were the common DEGs (Differential expressed genes) in the comparisons of body parts and breeds suggesting that the underlying molecular regulatory mechanism of dorsoventral plumage color difference may be similar to that of albino and melanic duck, which were caused by the different expression of multiple genes in melanin synthesis pathway. In addition, the molecular regulation of melanin synthesis pathway in the dorsal and ventral side of LBM ducks was analyzed. In this pathway, ASIP, MC1R, TYR, and TYRP1 have differential mRNA expression. ASIP, as an upstream gene in this pathway, was likely to play a decisive role in determining the dorsoventral plumage pattern.
79	33053451	Pathogenicity of a Jinding duck-origin cluster 2.1 isolate of Tembusu virus in 3-week-old Pekin ducklings.	Feng C, Jin M, Yang L, Lv J, Qu S, Meng R, Yang B, Wang X, Zhang D	Vet Microbiol	 2020 Dec;251:108870	 doi: 101016/jvetmic2020108870 Epub 2020 Sep 29	Tembusu virus (TMUV) infection most commonly affects breeder and layer ducks during laying period, and can also affect young ducks below 7 weeks of age. Here, we report our investigation of a TMUV-caused fatal disease of Jingding ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) in Northeast China. The disease resulted in mortalities of up to 40 % in 2 to 4-week-old ducks, up to 25 % in 5 to 6-week-old ducks, and less than 10 % in 7 to 8-week-old ducks. Using a TMUV-specific reverse transcription-PCR assay, all 44 ducks collected from 10 different farms were found positive for TMUV. Phylogenetic analysis of the E nucleotide sequence revealed that five of the six TMUV strains detected from three young ducks and three laying ducks were grouped within cluster 2.1. Inoculation of the liver sample of a 40-day-old sick duck in BHK-21 cells resulted in isolation of cluster 2.1 TMUV strain H. In experimental infections performed using 3-week-old Pekin ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) (n = 30; 10 birds/group), high mortality (60 %) was caused by strain H, in sharp contrast with a very low mortality (10 %) caused by strain Y which was isolated during outbreaks of the TMUV-related disease of young Jinding ducks in 2014 in the same region. These findings clearly demonstrated that the cluster 2.1 TMUV strain H is more pathogenic for 3-week-old ducklings as compared to the cluster 2.2 TMUV strain Y. The present study may enhance our understanding of pathogenicity of TMUV in young ducks, and will stimulate further studies on the pathogenesis of TMUV infection.
80	33046566	Manipulating plasma thyroid hormone levels at hatching alters development of endothermy and ventilation in Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Sirsat TS, Dzialowski EM	J Exp Biol	 2020 Nov 30;223(Pt 22)	 pii: jeb237701 doi: 101242/jeb237701	At hatching in precocial birds, there are rapid physiological and metabolic phenotypic changes associated with attaining endothermy. During the transition to ex ovo life, thyroid hormone levels naturally increase, peaking at hatching, and then decline. To better understand the role of the natural increase in thyroid hormone at hatching in regulating the developmental trajectory of the Pekin duck's endothermic phenotype, we examined development of O2 consumption (V O2 ) and ventilation (frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation) while inhibiting the developmental increase in thyroid hormones that occurs at hatching via administration of the thyroid-peroxidase inhibitor methimazole (MMI) or accelerating the developmental increase via triiodothyronine (T3) supplementation. Animals were dosed only on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period and studied on incubation day 25, during external pipping (EP) and 1 day post-hatching (dph). On day 25, there was an increase in V O2 in the hyperthyroid treatment compared with the other two treatments. During the EP stage, there was a significant effect of thyroid status on V O2 , with hyperthyroid V O2 being highest and hypothyroid V O2 the lowest. By 1 dph, the supplemented T3 and control animals had similar V O2 responses to cooling with comparable thermal neutral zones followed by increased V O2 Hypothyroid 1 dph hatchlings had a lower resting V O2 that did not increase to the same extent as the supplemented T3 and control animals during cooling. During EP, inhibiting the rise in T3 resulted in embryos with lower ventilation frequency and tidal volume than control and supplemented T3 embryos. At 1 dph, ventilation frequency of all animals increased during cooling, but tidal volume only increased in supplemented T3 and control hatchlings. Our data support the role of the late incubation increase in T3 in regulating the systemic development of endothermic metabolic capacity and associated control of ventilation occurring at hatching of the Pekin duck.
81	33005675	Free-ranging avifauna as a source of generalist parasites for captive birds in zoological settings: An overview of parasite records and potential for cross-transmission.	Carrera-Jativa PD, Morgan ER, Barrows M, Jimenez-Uzcategui G, Tituana JRA	J Adv Vet Anim Res	 2020 Aug 22;7(3):482-500	 doi: 105455/javar2020g445 eCollection 2020 Sep	Captive birds in zoological settings often harbor parasites, but little information is available about the potential for free-ranging avifauna to act as a source of infection. This review summarizes the gastrointestinal parasites found in zoo birds globally and in seven common free-ranging avian species [mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Eurasian jackdaw (Corvus monedula), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), European robin (Erithacus rubecula), and rock dove (Columba livia)] to identify the overlap and discuss the potential for cross-species transmission. Over 70 references were assessed, and papers spanned over 90 years from 1925 to 2019. A total of 60 studies from 1987 to 2019 met the eligibility criteria. All examined free-ranging avifauna harbored parasite species that were also reported in zoo birds, except for the European jackdaw. Parasites reported in captive and free-ranging birds include nematodes (Capillaria caudinflata, Dispharynx nasuta, Ornithostrongylus quadriradiatus, Strongyloides avium, Syngamus trachea, and Tetrameres fissispina), cestodes (Dicranotaenia coronula, Diorchis stefanskii, Fimbriaria fasciolaris, and Raillietina cesticillus, Sobolevicanthus gracilis), trematode (Echinostoma revolutum), and protozoa (Cryptosporidium baileyi). Although no study effectively proved cross-transmission either experimentally or by genetic analysis, these parasites demonstrate low host specificity and a high potential for parasite sharing. There is potential for parasite sharing whenever determinants such as host specificity, life cycle, and husbandry are favorable. More research should be carried out to describe parasites in both captive and free-ranging birds in zoological settings and the likelihood of cross-infection. Such information would contribute to evidence-based control measures, enhancing effective husbandry and preventive medicine protocols.
82	32989837	Reproductive season and male effect on quantitative and qualitative traits of individually collected Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) semen.	Lukaszewicz E, Jerysz A, Kowalczyk A	Reprod Domest Anim	 2020 Dec;55(12):1735-1746	 doi: 101111/rda13833 Epub 2020 Nov 3	Males of Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) are mainly used for mule duck production via artificial insemination of females originated from wild mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos); therefore, the quantity and quality of drake semen play a crucial role. The assessment results of male reaction to sexual stimulation by dummy female and basic semen characteristic (ejaculate volume, sperm concentration and morphology) of 12 individually kept Muscovy drakes carried out during the entire reproductive season are described. The male and period of the reproductive season effect on scored semen traits are documented. In total, 792 individual semen collections and evaluations were performed. The average of positive reaction in the entire reproductive season varied from 90.6% in December and April to 50.0% in July, while for individual males, it varied between 97.1% and 29.0%. Throughout the season, the ejaculate volumes ranged from 0.05 to 2.45 ml, sperm concentration from 0.15 x 10(9) ml(-1) to 4.44 x 10(9) ml(-1) , total number of live spermatozoa from 68.0% to 100% and live normal (properly formed, with any deformations) from 51.0% to 99.0%. Our study indicates the necessity of male breeders pre-selection before the onset of the reproductive season, and the need to leave an appropriate number of males to ensure adequate amount of semen for female insemination, especially when using Muscovy drakes (Cairina moschata) for interspecies crossing with Anas platyrhynchos ducks.
83	32956594	Identification of key genes and pathways associated with duck (Anas platyrhynchos) embryonic skin development using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.	Yuan X, Guo Q, Bai H, Jiang Y, Zhang Y, Liang W, Wang Z, Xu Q, Chang G, Chen G	Genome	 2020 Dec;63(12):615-628	 doi: 101139/gen-2020-0054 Epub 2020 Sep 21	Skin and feather follicle morphogenesis are important processes for duck development; however, the mechanisms underlying morphogenesis at the embryonic stage remain unclear. To improve the understanding of these processes, we used transcriptome and weighted gene co-expression network analyses to identify the critical genes and pathways involved in duck skin development. Five modules were found to be the most related to five key stages in skin development that span from embryonic day 8 (E8) to postnatal day 7 (D7). Using STEM software, 6519 genes from five modules were clustered into 10 profiles to reveal key genes. Above all, we obtained several key module genes including WNT3A, NOTCH1, SHH, BMP2, NOG, SMAD3, and TGFbeta2. Furthermore, we revealed that several pathways play critical roles throughout the skin development process, including the Wnt pathway and cytoskeletal rearrangement-related pathways, whereas others are involved in specific stages of skin development, such as the Notch, Hedgehog, and TGF-beta signaling pathways. Overall, this study identified the pathways and genes that play critical roles in skin development, which may provide a basis for high-quality down-type meat duck breeding.
84	32920930	Differential expression and localization of TRPV channels in the mature sperm of Anas platyrhynchos.	Majhi RK, Kumar A, Giri SC, Goswami C	Reprod Domest Anim	 2020 Nov;55(11):1619-1628	 doi: 101111/rda13822 Epub 2020 Oct 14	Sperm cells perform precise chemotactic and thermotactic movement which is crucial for fertilization. However, the key molecules involved in detection of different chemical and physical stimuli which guide the sperm during navigation are not well understood. Ca(2+) -signalling mediated by ion channels seem to play important role in motility and other fertility parameters. In this work, we explored the endogenous localization pattern of TRPV channels in the mature spermatozoa of avian species. Using sperm from white pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) as the representative avian model, we demonstrate that duck sperm endogenously express the thermosensitive channels TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, and highly Ca(2+) -selective channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 in specific yet differential locations. All of these TRPV channels are enriched in the sperm tail, indicating their relevance in sperm motility. Interestingly, the TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels are present in the mitochondrial region. Calcium selective TRPV5 channel is exclusively present in sperm tail and is most abundant among the TRPV channels. This is the first report describing the endogenous presence of TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels in the sperm of any species. Using confocal imaging and super-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that though the TRPV channels are evolutionarily closely related, they have distinct localization pattern in the duck sperm, which could impact their role in fertilization.
85	32873059	Molecular cloning, tissue expression and polymorphism analysis of the Caveolin-3 gene in ducks.	Zhang Y, Zhang Y, Xu L, Wang H, Shao F, Yu J, Gilbert E, Gu Z	Br Poult Sci	 2021 Feb;62(1):17-24	 doi: 101080/0007166820201817324 Epub 2020 Sep 29	1. Duck meat is considered a delicacy, but choosing the best meat is problematic. Caveolin-3 (CAV-3) is a muscle-specific protein marker in animals. The goal of the current study was to detect the characteristics of CAV-3 gene in ducks. 2. Full-length CAV-3 was acquired from ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) using reverse transcriptase PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. DNAMAN software was used for homology comparisons. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing were used to determine CAV-3 expression and polymorphism of a single nucleotide, respectively. The study examined four types of ducks, including Jinding, Chaohu, Cherry Valley, and Gaoyou ducks. 3. The study acquired 1066 bp of CAV-3 cDNA sequences, including a 456 bp complete open reading frame encoding 151 amino acids. Both coding sequences (CDSs) and translated amino acids exhibited highest homology with Gallus gallus (CDS homology 91.67%, amino acids 94.04%), followed by mammalian species (CDS homology 79.0%, amino acids 78.0%). Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed five mutations in exons (A489G, G501A, A557G, T563A, and A602G), and a C805T mutation in an intron. Among amplified polymorphic loci detected using primer 2, allele frequency was higher for A (489A501G507A563T602A) than B (489G501G507G563T602C) or C (489G501A507G563A602C). The highest occurred in Cherry Valley ducks (0.7587). Using primer 4, the M allele frequency was higher than that of the N allele. CAV-3 was most highly expressed in the heart, followed by skeletal muscles. Additionally, CAV-3 had higher expression in heart and breast muscle of overfed Muscovy ducks than control ducks, but no difference was seen in thigh muscle. 4. CAV-3 in ducks had the highest homology with Gallus gallus CAV-3, and it could be used as a marker for muscle quality in ducks.
86	32866175	Differences in the growth rate and immune strategies of farmed and wild mallard populations.	Svobodova J, Pinkasova H, Hyrsl P, Dvorackova M, Zita L, Kreisinger J	PLoS One	 2020 Aug 31;15(8):e0236583	 doi: 101371/journalpone0236583 eCollection 2020	Individuals reared in captivity are exposed to distinct selection pressures and evolutionary processes causing genetic and phenotypic divergence from wild populations. Consequently, restocking with farmed individuals may represent a considerable risk for the fitness of free-living populations. Supportive breeding on a massive scale has been established in many European countries to increase hunting opportunities for the most common duck species, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). It has previously been shown that mallards from breeding facilities differ genetically from wild populations and there is some indication of morphological differences. Using a common-garden experiment, we tested for differences in growth parameters between free-living populations and individuals from breeding facilities during the first 20 days of post-hatching development, a critical phase for survival in free-living populations. In addition, we compared their immune function by assessing two haematological parameters, H/L ratio and immature erythrocyte frequency, and plasma complement activity. Our data show that farmed ducklings exhibit larger morphological parameters, a higher growth rates, and higher complement activity. In haematological parameters, we observed high dynamic changes in duckling ontogeny in relation to their morphological parameters. In conclusion, our data demonstrate pronounced phenotype divergence between farmed and wild mallard populations that can be genetically determined. We argue that this divergence can directly or indirectly affect fitness of farmed individuals introduced to the breeding population as well as fitness of farmed x wild hybrids.
87	32783837	Diversity of wintering waterbirds enhanced by restoring aquatic vegetation at Shengjin Lake, China.	Zhou J, Zhou L, Xu W	Sci Total Environ	 2020 Oct 1;737:140190	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv2020140190 Epub 2020 Jun 16	The restoration of planted vegetation contributes towards improving the habitat quality of waterbirds and enhancing the diversity of their communities. Thus, the success of projects attempting to restore aquatic vegetation could, in part, be quantified by evaluating the community structure of wintering waterbirds. Here, we evaluated the effect of wetland restoration (through planting aquatic vegetation) by comparing waterbird communities in restored versus unrestored areas over two wintering periods (2017-2018 and 2018-2019). Specifically, the use of aquatic vegetation by waterbirds was evaluated following restoration, and was compared against three control (unrestored) areas; namely, a Euryale ferox planting area, freshwater aquaculture area, and rice planting area. Twenty-nine species belonging to eleven families of waterbirds were recorded across the four habitats. Species richness and density of waterbirds in the restored aquatic vegetation area were significantly higher than those in the three control areas. The restored aquatic vegetation area had the highest absolute value of Temporal Beta-diversity Index (TBI), while species gains (C) were significantly greater than species losses (B). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the number of wintering waterbird species from three foraging guilds in the restored aquatic vegetation area during the wintering period of 2018-2019 compared to 2017-2018 (Granivore guild; Invertivore guild; Piscivore guild). The restoration of aquatic vegetation mainly caused the number of Anatidae species to increase, including ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), common teal (Anas crecca), common mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha), and common pochard (Aythya ferina). Submerged vegetation provides ducks with important food resources, such as seeds. And emerging vegetation facilitating the concealment of waterbirds. In conclusion, the artificial promotion of aquatic vegetation restoration at Shengjin Lake has contributed towards maintaining the structure of wintering waterbird communities.
88	32768221	Isolation and partial genetic characterization of a new duck adenovirus in China.	Huang Y, Kang H, Dong J, Li L, Zhang J, Sun J, Zhang J, Sun M	Vet Microbiol	 2020 Aug;247:108775	 doi: 101016/jvetmic2020108775 Epub 2020 Jun 23	A novel duck adenovirus, isolated from Jinding Ducks(Anas platyrhynchos domestica), was proposed to be duck adenovirus 4 (DAdV-4), extending the genus Aviadenovirus. In this study, we sequenced the central genome part from Iva2 gene to fiber gene of the DAdV-4 that is conserved in all adenovirus genera. Phylogenetic analysis and protease cleavage site analysis verified the classification of DAdV-4 in the genus Aviadenovirus. Nucleotide identity analysis showed low sequence identity between central genome part genes of DAdV-4 with that of other aviadenoviruses. The phylogenetic tree based on the full amino acid sequence of hexon and DNA polymerase showed that the DAdV-4 appeared on a relatively independent branch. Our analysis suggested that DAdV-4 is a distinct type and represents a novel species. Although DAdV-4 has not caused serious disease outbreaks among ducks yet, the virus should be considered as a potential threat to the poultry industry.
89	32609043	Molecular cloning, tissue distribution and function analysis of duck TLR7.	Gu T, Li G, Wu X, Zeng T, Xu Q, Li L, Vladyslav S, Chen G, Lu L	Anim Biotechnol	 2022 Apr;33(2):234-241	 doi: 101080/1049539820201784186 Epub 2020 Jul 1	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Among the TLRs, TLR7 is involved in the recognition of antiviral compounds and single-stranded RNA. This study was designed to explore the structure and function of TLR7 in duck (Anas platyrhynchos), a natural host for avian influenza virus. Firstly, the full-length cDNA of Shaoxing egg-laying duck TLR7 (duTLR7) was obtained using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). It consisted of 38 base pairs (bp) 5'-untranslated region (UTR), 187 bp 3'-UTR, and 3270 bp open reading frame that encodes a single protein of 1089 amino acid residues. DuTLR7 shares high identity with TLR7 genes from other vertebrates. In healthy ducks, duTLR7 transcripts were broadly expressed in different tissues, with higher expression levels in the liver, kidney, and thymus. The highest relative transcript level of duTLR7 could be induced with R848 stimulation. In addition, overexpression of duTLR7 by stimulating with poly(I:C) significantly promoted IFN-beta, NF-kappaB, IRF7, TRIF, Mx, STAT1 and STAT2 expressions. Taken together, these results suggest that TLR7 may play an important role in the innate immune response of ducks.
90	32608095	Does the renal portal valve exist in a raptor species- A study aimed at further evaluating the mechanism of toxicity of diclofenac in vultures.	Havenga L, Naidoo V, Wolter K, Duncan N, Groenewald HB	Anat Histol Embryol	 2020 Nov;49(6):836-841	 doi: 101111/ahe12590 Epub 2020 Jun 30	Diclofenac has been responsible for the deaths of millions of vultures on the Asian subcontinent. While the pathology of toxicity is well described, the mechanism of toxicity remains elusive. However, it was postulated that toxicity could be related to the unique avian renal vascular structure known as the renal portal valve and that that diclofenac altered valve functionality with subsequent renal ischaemia. While plausible, the valva renalis portalis has only been described in a small number of other bird species such as the chicken (Gallus domesticus), the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and ostrich (Struthio camelus) but not a raptor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the renal anatomy and related vasculature of the Cape griffon vulture (Gyps coprotheres) (CGV), a species sensitive to the toxic effects of diclofenac, using gross anatomy, histology and vascular casting. The vasculature of the vulture was found to be almost identical to that of the domestic chicken with the valva renalis portalis present in the v. iliaca externa between the v. renalis renalis cranialis and the v. renalis caudalus. The valve was ring-shaped with finger-like processes and histologically was composed of smooth muscle. The valve was also well vascularized and was associated with a nerve plexus. Based on the findings of this study, the proposed mechanism of toxicity is anatomically possible.
91	32603233	Micro- and macroanatomical features of the uropygial gland of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and pigeon (Columba livia).	Hassanin A, Shoeib M, Massoud D	Biotech Histochem	 2021 Apr;96(3):213-222	 doi: 101080/1052029520201782990 Epub 2020 Jun 30	We describe the morphological, histological and histochemical characteristics of the uropygial gland of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and pigeon (Columba livia). The weight and dimensions of the glands were recorded. The gland openings onto the papilla in ducks were surrounded by double tufts of downy feathers; the tufts were held together by an oily secretion. In the pigeon, the gland opening was onto naked skin. Samples for light and transmission electron microscopy were obtained from adult birds. Gland morphometry of the duck showed greater dimensions and relative gland weight than the pigeon. In both species the gland was lined by stratified epithelium, packed with secretary tubules and filled with oil droplets that were discharged into a central cavity. In the pigeon, the gland was branched and alveolar with a wide central lumen, whereas in the duck it was simple and branched tubular. Ultrastructural analysis of both species revealed that the fat globules tended to condense in the peripheral layers of the secretory and degenerative cells, and the nuclei exhibited pyknosis, which suggest the holocrine nature of the gland. Morphometric and histological analysis of the gland showed that the architecture is similar among birds; however, some species-specific differences suggest a functional correlation with the habitat.
92	32545281	YearRound Influenza A Virus Surveillance in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) Reveals Genetic Persistence During the UnderSampled Spring Season.	Lauterbach SE, McBride DS, Shirkey BT, Nolting JM, Bowman AS	Viruses	 2020 Jun 11;12(6)	 pii: v12060632 doi: 103390/v12060632	Active influenza A virus (IAV) surveillance in wild waterfowl in the United States has revolved around convenience-based sampling methods, resulting in gaps in surveillance during the spring season. We conducted active IAV surveillance in mallards continuously from July 2017 to July 2019 in the coastal marshes of Lake Erie near Port Clinton, Ohio. We aimed to understand ecological and evolutionary dynamics of IAV across multiple seasons, including the undersampled spring season. We collected 2096 cloacal swabs and estimated a 6.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.050-0.071) prevalence during the study period. Prevalence was lowest during spring (1.0%, 95% CI: 0.004-0.015). Timestamped phylogenetic analyses revealed local persistence of genetic lineages of multiple gene segments. The PA segment consists of a lineage detected in multiple seasons with a time to most recent common ancestor of 2.48 years (95% highest posterior density: 2.16-2.74). Analysis of the H3 and H6 segments showed close relation between IAVs detected in spring and the following autumn migration. Though the mechanisms behind viral persistence in a single location are not well understood, we provide evidence that viruses can persist across several seasons. Current surveillance methods should be evaluated to ensure they are capturing the breadth of genetic diversity of IAV in waterfowl and prepare for IAV outbreaks in both animals and humans.
93	32526407	Is intraspecies QSTR model answer to toxicity data gap filling: Ecotoxicity modeling of chemicals to avian species.	Kar S, Leszczynski J	Sci Total Environ	 2020 Oct 10;738:139858	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv2020139858 Epub 2020 Jun 1	Interspecies model represents an established approach for the response data gap filling for regulatory agencies and researchers. We propose a novel approach of intraspecies modeling within the animals of the same species, instead of animals from different species. The proposed intraspecies model is capable of more precise extrapolation of data than the interspecies model, as animals under the same species share a similar mechanism of action (MOA) and target sites for the response. Along with the advantage of better prediction over the interspecies model, the intraspecies model has all the significant features like recognition of MOA, species-specific toxicity, reduction of animal experimentation, and money and time. To establish and test the intraspecies modeling approach, we have modeled ecotoxicity of organic chemicals to three avian species: Anas platyrhynchos, Colinus virginianus, and Phasianus colchicus. The intraspecies models offer to identify the mechanistic interpretation of the ecotoxicity of the studied chemicals along with the toxicity data gap filling. The success of the intraspecies modeling relies on connecting the missing dots of toxicity for the regulatory purposes, especially when there is a scarcity of ecotoxicity experimental data and in silico models for avian species.
94	32366736	Molecular cloning, expression and mimicking antiviral activity analysis of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I in duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Gu T, Li G, Tian Y, Chen L, Wu X, Zeng T, Xu Q, Vladyslav S, Chen G, Lu L	J Genet	 2020;99		Intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a chief sign of replication for many viruses. Pattern recognition receptors(PRRs) of the innate immune system detected the dsRNA and initiate the antiviral responses. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a member of PRRs, plays an essential regulatory role in dsRNA-induced signalling. In this study, the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of duck RIG-I (duRIG-I) was cloned using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA of duRIG-I contained 97-bp 5'UTR, 141-bp 3'-UTR and 2802 bp complete open-reading frame (ORF) encoding 933 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignments showed that duRIG-I shared high similarity with RIG-I from other vertebrates. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that duRIG-I mRNA was expressed in all tested tissues, with high levels in the liver, heart, spleen, kidney and thymus, while lower in the duodenum. duRIG-I could be induced by treatment with poly(I:C). Further, overexpression of duRIG-I significantly activated the transcription of poly(I:C)-induced IFN-b, IRF7, TRIF, Mx, STAT1 and STAT2 mRNA, and duRIG-I knockdown showed the opposite results. Overall, our results suggested that duRIG-I could be an important receptor for mimicking antiviral state in duck, which warrant further studies to show the possible mechanism.
95	32359603	High-temperature exposure alters the community structure and functional features of the intestinal microbiota in Shaoxing ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Tian Y, Li G, Chen L, Bu X, Shen J, Tao Z, Zeng T, Du X, Lu L	Poult Sci	 2020 May;99(5):2662-2674	 doi: 101016/jpsj201912046 Epub 2020 Apr 2	The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that contributes to host nutrition and health. However, our current knowledge of the relationship between ambient temperature and gut microbiota of poultry is still limited. The objective of the present study was to characterize the intestinal microbiota of ducks exposed to high ambient temperature. Sixty 60-day-old Shaoxing ducks were allocated to control and heat-treated groups. The ducks in the control group were kept at 25 degrees C, and the ducks in the heat treatment group were raised at 30-40 degrees C, which simulated the temperature change of day and night in summer. After 15 D, the intestinal contents of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were obtained from 6 ducks of each group. Genomic DNA was extracted and amplified based on the V4-V5 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA. The results showed that Firmicutes was the dominant bacterial phylum with the highest abundance in the contents of the small intestine of ducks, and the relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes in all 3 intestinal segments was increased by high temperature. At the genus level, Lactobacillus was found to be the most dominant bacterial genus across 3 gut segments, and its abundance was increased in ducks under heat treatment. Compared with the corresponding intestine segment of control ducks, a total of 36 genera in the duodenum, 19 genera in the jejunum, and 6 genera in the ileum of heat-treated ducks were found to be significantly different in the abundance (linear discriminant analysis score >3.0, P < 0.05). Functional prediction of gut microbiota revealed that high temperature caused changes in the abundance of metabolism and transcription-related pathways. It is noteworthy that most of the altered pathways are related to metabolism. In conclusion, high temperature induced remarkable taxonomic changes in the gut microbiome of ducks, which might be related to the negative effects of high temperature in ducks. Our present study provided an important theoretical ground for high-temperature intervention.
96	32333043	Feathers of Three Waterfowl Bird Species from Northern Iran for Heavy Metals Biomonitoring.	Solgi E, Mirzaei-Rajeouni E, Zamani A	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	 2020 Jun;104(6):727-732	 doi: 101007/s00128-020-02852-7 Epub 2020 Apr 24	Waterbirds are considered the effective sentinels of aquatic ecosystems contamination and their feathers are widely used as non-destructive biological tools for contaminant biomonitoring. In this work, we measure and evaluate the concentrations of lead, copper and zinc in the breast feathers of three species namely Fulica atra, Anas crecca and Anas platyrhynchos in the wetland National Park Boujagh. Levels of lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) were below the threshold that causes sub-lethal and reproductive effects. Significant differences in metal concentrations were found among bird species. The finding indicated that highest Pb and Zn concentrations were observed in common Coot. The effect of sex on heavy metal was observed for Pb in Anas platyrhynchos and while Cu, Zn in Anas crecca. Concentrations of metals were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in resident birds than in migratory. High levels of these heavy metals show that these birds can be used to monitor contamination in the wetland.
97	32184998	Timing, frequency, and duration of incubation recesses in dabbling ducks.	Croston R, Hartman CA, Herzog MP, Casazza ML, Feldheim CL, Ackerman JT	Ecol Evol	 2020 Feb 12;10(5):2513-2529	 doi: 101002/ece36078 eCollection 2020 Mar	Nest attendance is an important determinant of avian reproductive success, and identifying factors that influence the frequency and duration of incubation recesses furthers our understanding of how incubating birds balance their needs with those of their offspring. We characterized the frequency and timing (start time, end time, and duration) of incubation recesses for mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and gadwall (Mareca strepera) hens breeding in Suisun Marsh, California, USA, and examined the influences of day of year, ambient temperature at the nest, incubation day, and clutch size on recess frequency and timing using linear mixed models. Mallard, on average, took more recesses per day (1.69 +/- 0.80, mean +/- standard deviation) than did gadwall (1.39 +/- 0.69), and 45% of mallard nest-days were characterized by two recesses, while only 27% of gadwall nest-days were characterized by two recesses. Mallard morning recesses started at 06:14 +/- 02:46 and lasted 106.11 +/- 2.01 min, whereas mallard afternoon recesses started at 16:39 +/- 02:11 and lasted 155.39 +/- 1.99 min. Gadwall morning recesses started at 06:30 +/- 02:46 and lasted 91.28 +/- 2.32 min, and gadwall afternoon recesses started at 16:31 +/- 01:57 and lasted 192.69 +/- 1.89 min. Mallard and gadwall started recesses earlier in the day with increasing ambient temperature, but later in the day as the season progressed. Recess duration decreased as the season progressed and as clutch size increased, and increased with ambient temperature at the nest. The impending darkness of sunset appeared to be a strong cue for ending a recess and returning to the nest, because hens returned to their nests earlier than expected when recesses were expected to end after sunset. Within hens, the timing of incubation recesses was repeatable across incubation days and was most repeatable for mallard afternoon recesses and on days in which hens took only one recess. Hens were most likely to be away from nests between 04:00 and 07:00 and between 16:00 and 19:00; therefore, investigators should search for nests between 07:00 and 16:00. Our analyses identified important factors influencing incubation recess timing in dabbling ducks and have important implications for nest monitoring programs.

In this study, we identified and characterized the function of duck SP3 (duSP3). The full-length cDNA sequence of the duSP3 gene was cloned via rapid amplification of cDNA ends. It contained 2468 nucleotides, including a 111 base pair (bp) 5'-untranslated region (UTR), 215 bp 3'-UTR, and 2142 bp open reading frame (ORF), which encoded a 713 amino acid (AA) strongly conserved with Avian SP3. Tissue specificity analysis demonstrated that duSP3 was constitutively expressed in the eight tissues tested: liver, spleen, lung, heart, kidney, thymus, breast, and leg; and low expression levels were observed in all tissues, except the spleen and thymus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that duSP3 expression rapidly increased in vitro after stimulation with both the hepatitis virus (DHV-1) and polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). However, the expression under these treatments varied in kidney and liver tissues; in the liver, duSP3 increased significantly at 36 h after the DHV-1 treatment and peaked at 72 h after poly(I:C) stimulation. These results suggested that SP3 may play a positive role in immune responses against viral infections in ducks.
99	32088756	Systemic collapse of a host-parasite trematode network associated with wetland birds in Europe.	Sitko J, Heneberg P	Parasitol Res	 2020 Mar;119(3):935-945	 doi: 101007/s00436-020-06624-4 Epub 2020 Feb 22	As host community diversity decreases, parasite diversity may also decline. The life cycles of trematodes involve multiple hosts from different orders, with many trematodes displaying narrow host specialization. In the 1960s and 2010s, we performed full-body necropsies of juvenile or first-year birds of four wetland bird species, Anas platyrhynchos, Aythya fuligula, Fulica atra, and Chroicocephalus ridibundus which originated from the southern Czech Republic, and examined them for the presence of trematodes. We compared the trematode species richness and diversity of the analyzed component communities. We found complete disintegration of host-parasite networks, which led to declining populations and local extinctions of the majority of trematode species, particularly those with narrow host preferences. For example, in black-headed gulls, 67% of trematode species recorded in the 1960s were absent in gulls that were examined in the 2010s. In contrast, we did not identify any trematode species that were absent in the 1960s but present in the 2010s. This collapse provides new insight into the recent debate regarding whether human-caused extinctions should be considered a problem when locally extinct host species are replaced by an equal or even higher number of nonnative species, thus maintaining local alpha diversities but leading to biotic homogenization and consequently reducing beta diversity. By documenting the collapse of the host-parasite network, we provide a strong argument that biodiversity cannot be assessed by simple measures alone, as only local-scale conservation measures allow the preservation of host-pathogen interactions and nutrient cycles and thus prevent the loss of low-visibility species, such as helminths.
100	32076524	Seed mass, hardness, and phylogeny explain the potential for endozoochory by granivorous waterbirds.	Lovas-Kiss A, Vincze O, Kleyheeg E, Sramko G, Laczko L, Fekete R, Molnar V A, Green AJ	Ecol Evol	 2020 Jan 15;10(3):1413-1424	 doi: 101002/ece35997 eCollection 2020 Feb	Field studies have shown that waterbirds, especially members of the Anatidae family, are major vectors of dispersal by endozoochory for a broad range of plants lacking a fleshy fruit, yet whose propagules can survive gut passage. Widely adopted dispersal syndromes ignore this dispersal mechanism, and we currently have little understanding of what traits determine the potential of angiosperms for endozoochory by waterbirds. Results from previous experimental studies have been inconsistent as to how seed traits affect seed survival and retention time in the gut and have failed to control for the influence of plant phylogeny. Using 13 angiosperm species from aquatic and terrestrial habitats representing nine families, we examined the effects of seed size, shape, and hardness on the proportion of seeds surviving gut passage through mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and their retention time within the gut. We compiled a molecular phylogeny for these species and controlled for the nonindependence of taxa due to common descent in our analyses. Intact seeds from all 13 species were egested, but seed survival was strongly determined by phylogeny and by partial effects of seed mass and hardness (wet load): species with seeds harder than expected from their size, and smaller than expected from their loading, had greater survival. Once phylogeny was controlled for, a positive partial effect of seed roundness on seed survival was also revealed. Species with seeds harder than expected from their size had a longer mean retention time, a result retained after controlling for phylogeny. Our study is the first to demonstrate that seed shape and phylogeny are important predictors of seed survival in the avian gut. Our results demonstrate that the importance of controlling simultaneously for multiple traits and relating single traits (e.g., seed size) alone to seed survival or retention time is not a reliable way to detect important patterns, especially when phylogenetic effects are ignored.
101	32059679	Detection of fowl adenovirus D strains in wild birds in Poland by Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP).	Niczyporuk JS, Kozdrun W, Czekaj H, Stys-Fijol N, Piekarska K	BMC Vet Res	 2020 Feb 14;16(1):58	 doi: 101186/s12917-020-2271-4	BACKGROUND: The present study on the role of strains of adenovirus in wildlife reservoirs, and their prevalence is under exploration. In several previous studies, the presence of adenovirus strains in wild birds has been investigated. Worldwide distribution and outbreaks of adenovirus infections have been reported by many authors. The present study investigated the prevalence of FAdVs in 317 samples of different bird species from the northwestern region of Poland. An applied specific, sensitive, and efficient, without cross-reactivity loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to gauge the prevalence of fowl adenovirus strains in wild birds was developed and used. RESULTS: The method was based on the sequence of the loop L1 HVR1-4 region of the hexon gene of the FAdV genome reference strains FAdV-2 KT862805 (ANJ02325), FAdV-3 KT862807 (ANJ02399) and FAdV-11 KC750784 (AGK29904). The results obtained by LAMP were confirmed by real-time PCR. Among 317 samples obtained from wild birds, eight FAdV isolates (2.52%) were identified and produced a cytopathic effect (CPE) in chicken embryo kidney cells (CEK). Three FAdV types belonging to species Fowl adenovirus D were detected, which were isolated from three adenovirus types 2/3/11, and have been confirmed in three mute swans (Cygnus olor), three wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), one owl (Strigiformes), and one common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first accurate quantitative data for the replication of fowl adenovirus strains in wild birds in Poland, indicating adenovirus interspecies transmission, and demonstrating the circulation of FAdVs in wild birds.
102	31969057	Modulation of lethal HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4B infection in AIV pre-exposed mallards.	Koethe S, Ulrich L, Ulrich R, Amler S, Graaf A, Harder TC, Grund C, Mettenleiter TC, Conraths FJ, Beer M, Globig A	Emerg Microbes Infect	 2020 Jan 23;9(1):180-193	 doi: 101080/2222175120201713706 eCollection 2020	In 2016/2017, a severe epidemic of HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 group B (H5N8B) affected Europe. To analyse the role of mallards in the spatiotemporal dynamics of global HPAIV H5N8B dispersal, mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), naturally exposed to various AIV and therefore seropositive, were challenged with H5N8B. All experiments were controlled by infection and co-housing of seronegative juvenile Pekin ducklings. All ducks that survived the first infection were re-challenged 21 dpi with the homologous H5N8B strain. After the first H5N8B infection, seropositive mallards showed only mild clinical symptoms. Moderate to low viral shedding, occurring particularly from the oropharynx and lasting for 7 days maximum, led to severe clinical disease of all contact ducklings. All challenged seronegative Pekin ducks and contact ducklings died or had to be euthanized. H5-specific antibodies were detected in surviving birds within 2 weeks. Virus and viral RNA could be isolated from several water samples until 6 and 9 dpi, respectively. Conversely, upon re-infection with homologous H5N8B neither inoculated nor contact ducklings showed any clinical symptoms, nor was an antibody titer increase of seropositive mallards or any seroconversion of contact ducklings observed. Mallard ducks naturally pre-exposed to LPAIV can play a role as a clinically unsuspicious virus reservoir for H5N8B effective in virus transmission. Mallards with homologous immunity did not contribute to virus transmission.
103	31952469	Dynamic accumulation of fatty acids in duck (Anas platyrhynchos) breast muscle and its correlations with gene expression.	Fan W, Liu W, Liu H, Meng Q, Xu Y, Guo Y, Wang B, Zhou Z, Hou S	BMC Genomics	 2020 Jan 17;21(1):58	 doi: 101186/s12864-020-6482-7	BACKGROUND: Fatty acid composition contributes greatly to the quality and nutritional value of meat. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying fatty acid accumulation in poultry have not yet been cleared. The aims of this study were to characterize the dynamics of fatty acid accumulation in duck breast muscle and investigate its correlations with gene expression. RESULTS: Here, we analyzed the fatty acid profile and transcriptome of breast muscle derived from Pekin ducks and mallards at the ages of 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks. Twenty fatty acids were detected in duck breast muscle, with palmitic acid (C16:0, 16.6%~ 21.1%), stearic acid (C18:0, 9.8%~ 17.7%), oleic acid (C18:1n-9, 15.7%~ 33.8%), linoleic acid (C18:2n-6, 10.8%~ 18.9%) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6, 11.7%~ 28.9%) as the major fatty acids. Our results showed that fatty acid composition was similar between the two breeds before 6 weeks, but the compositions diverged greatly after this point, mainly due to the stronger capacity for C16:0 and C18:1n-9 deposition in Pekin ducks. By comparing the multistage transcriptomes of Pekin ducks and mallards, we identified 2025 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Cluster analysis of these DEGs revealed that the genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid degradation and the PPAR signaling pathway were upregulated in mallard at 8 weeks. Moreover, correlation analysis of the DEGs and fatty acid composition traits suggested that the DEGs involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis and fatty acid beta-oxidation may interact to influence the deposition of fatty acids in duck breast muscle. CONCLUSIONS: We reported the temporal progression of fatty acid accumulation and the dynamics of the transcriptome in breast muscle of Pekin ducks and mallards. Our results provide insights into the transcriptome regulation of fatty acid accumulation in duck breast muscle, and will facilitate improvements of fatty acid composition in duck breeding.

Yaghoubi H, Ghalyanchi Langeroudi A, Karimi V, Ghafouri SA, Hashemzadeh M, Hosseini H, Fallah Mehrabadi MH, Sadat Mousavi F, Najafi H	Arch Razi Inst	 2019 Dec;74(4):349-355	 doi: 1022092/ari20181167861176 Epub 2019 Dec 1	Gamma Coronaviruses (GCoVs) are distributed worldwide, affecting a wide range of bird species, the beluga whale, and bottlenose dolphins. Because of the limited proofreading capability in the viral encoded polymerase, they emerge genetically diverse. There has been no molecular surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of GCOVs in avian species. The present study was conducted to detect GCOVs in Tehran birds&amp;rsquo; parks, 2015. Cloacal swabs (267 samples) from eight different bird species ((Chickens (Gallus gallus), Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Partridge (Perdix perdix), Quail (Coturnix coturnix), Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Goose (Anserini),and Guinea fowl (Numididae)) were collected, the viral RNA was extracted, the RT-PCR was performed using QIAGEN one step RT-PCR kit and the primers targeting &amp;ldquo;3&amp;#39;-UTR&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Nucleocapsid&amp;rdquo; genes. The detection rate was approximately 8.99%. GCOVs were detected in the chicken, quail, pheasant, turkey, and the partridge with different prevalence rates. Phylogenetic tree based on partial nucleotide sequences of the N gene clustered the samples into two groups. It is the first report of GCOVs in non-commercial birds in Iran. According to our results, GCOVs are circulating in different avian species, and further studies are needed to isolate these viruses and evaluate their pathogenesis.
105	31895644	GEOGRAPHIC AND ECOLOGIC ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF TREMATODES OF MALLARDS (ANAS PLATYRHYNCHOS) IN NORTHERN POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC.	Rzad I, Sitko J, Dzika E, Zalewski K, Smietana P, Busse P	J Wildl Dis	 2020 Jul;56(3):576-587	 doi: 107589/2019-02-041 Epub 2020 Jan 2	Trematode infestation of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) varies between northern Poland and the Czech Republic. We determined the trematode fauna of juvenile and adult Mallards from Poland in 2010-16 (n=79 Mallards) and from the Czech Republic in 1964-2001 (n=296). Infracommunity diversity of trematodes from juvenile Mallards, defined by the Brillouin index and mean number of species, was significantly greater in Poland than it was in the Czech Republic. There were more species and greater biodiversity in the trematode communities of Mallards from Poland, where the environment is more natural and less altered by human activity than it is in the Czech Republic. In the trematode community of juvenile Mallards, the Simpson's index of biodiversity was higher in the Czech Republic than it was in Poland. The Berger-Parker dominance index was comparable in both countries. In terms of prevalence, the structure of the trematode fauna was hierarchic, and trematode species had different positions in this hierarchy in the two countries. Statistically significant differences in the epidemiologic indices between infection of juvenile Mallards from Poland and the Czech Republic were noted for Bilharziella polonica, Echinostoma miyagawai, Echinostoma revolutum, Prosthogonimus cuneatus, Prosthogonimus ovatus, Notocotylus attenuatus, Echinoparyphium recurvatum, Australapatemon minor, Apatemon gracilis, Cyathocotyle prussica, Hypoderaeum conoideum, Metorchis xanthosomus, Psilochasmus oxyurus, and Cotylurus cornutus.
106	31872482	Assessing changes in genomic divergence following a century of human-mediated secondary contact among wild and captive-bred ducks.	Lavretsky P, McInerney NR, Mohl JE, Brown JI, James HF, McCracken KG, Fleischer RC	Mol Ecol	 2020 Feb;29(3):578-595	 doi: 101111/mec15343 Epub 2020 Jan 8	Along with manipulating habitat, the direct release of domesticated individuals into the wild is a practice used worldwide to augment wildlife populations. We test between possible outcomes of human-mediated secondary contact using genomic techniques at both historical and contemporary timescales for two iconic duck species. First, we sequence several thousand ddRAD-seq loci for contemporary mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) throughout North America and two domestic mallard types (i.e., known game-farm mallards and feral Khaki Campbell's). We show that North American mallards may well be becoming a hybrid swarm due to interbreeding with domesticated game-farm mallards released for hunting. Next, to attain a historical perspective, we applied a bait-capture array targeting thousands of loci in century-old (1842-1915) and contemporary (2009-2010) mallard and American black duck (Anas rubripes) specimens. We conclude that American black ducks and mallards have always been closely related, with a divergence time of ~600,000 years before present, and likely evolved through prolonged isolation followed by limited bouts of gene flow (i.e., secondary contact). They continue to maintain genetic separation, a finding that overturns decades of prior research and speculation suggesting the genetic extinction of the American black duck due to contemporary interbreeding with mallards. Thus, despite having high rates of hybridization, actual gene flow is limited between mallards and American black ducks. Conversely, our historical and contemporary data confirm that the intensive stocking of game-farm mallards during the last ~100 years has fundamentally changed the genetic integrity of North America's wild mallard population, especially in the east. It thus becomes of great interest to ask whether the iconic North American mallard is declining in the wild due to introgression of maladaptive traits from domesticated forms. Moreover, we hypothesize that differential gene flow from domestic game-farm mallards into the wild mallard population may explain the overall temporal increase in differentiation between wild black ducks and mallards, as well as the uncoupling of genetic diversity and effective population size estimates across time in our results. Finally, our findings highlight how genomic methods can recover complex population histories by capturing DNA preserved in traditional museum specimens.
107	31779284	Botulism in Wild Birds and Changes in Environmental Habitat: A Relationship to be Considered.	Circella E, Camarda A, Bano L, Marzano G, Lombardi R, D'Onghia F, Greco G	Animals (Basel)	 2019 Nov 26;9(12)	 pii: ani9121034 doi: 103390/ani9121034	Any human activity, even if aimed at the improvement of a natural area, can potentially affect wildlife, leading to possible short-term or long-term changes due to the human-wildlife interaction. In this study, a botulism outbreak which occurred in waterfowl in a nature reserve after a conservative environmental action is reported. More than 180 different species of wild birds, including seventy waterfowl species, live in the area. The wildlife reserve rangers built an artificial pond equipped with draining canals in the wetland in order to improve the environment of waterfowl species and to facilitate their supply of food. Then, presumably due to tidal rides, gray mullets (Mugil cephalus) arrived from the sea and settled in the pond. The number of fishes gradually increased, and several fishes died with a peak of mortality in the summer of 2017, creating a great amount of decaying organic material and the optimal conditions for Clostridium botulinum growth and toxin production. A botulism outbreak then occurred rapidly and was characterised by flaccid paralysis and sudden mortality of the birds. Seven mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), 4 common teals (Anas crecca), 1 garganey (Anas querquedula), 2 wood sandpipers (Tringa glareola), 1 little egret (Egretta garzetta), 1 little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), and 4 Eurasian coots (Fulica atra) were found dead. Interestingly, the toxin identified as responsible for the disease outbreak was the mosaic of type C and D toxins (C/D type). The prompt removal of the fish carcasses led to a rapid resolution of the outbreak of the disease, highlighting the relevance of a correct management for any action in environmental contexts. The conclusion is that any human activity in wildlife habitats should be carefully considered in order to assess the possible impacts and to quickly identify the possible risks of changes in wildlife population.
108	31770824	Comparison of immunohistochemistry and Ziehl-Neelsen staining for detecting the distribution of Mycobacterium avium subsp avium in naturally infected domestic Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Zhu D, Chen H, Ou X, Liu M, Wang M, Zhao X, Jia R, Chen S, Sun K, Yang Q, Wu Y, Chen X, Cheng A	Vet Med Sci	 2020 May;6(2):242-247	 doi: 101002/vms3223 Epub 2019 Nov 26	In order to detect the distribution of Mycobacterium avium subsp avium (MAA) in naturally infected domestic Pekin ducks, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining were used and compared. Six organs, the liver, spleen, lung, kidney, duodenum and pectoralis muscle, were collected from naturally infected Pekin ducks. Paraffin embedded tissues were examined, and the results were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-Square test. The results showed that the detection rates by IHC were similar with ZN staining in liver, lung, spleen and pectoralis muscle, but the detection rates by IHC were much higher than ZN staining in kidney and duodenum (p = .013, p = .0044). The liver (87.5%) and lung (81.3%) had the highest detection rates. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were primarily found intracellularly in six organs using ZN staining. Similarly, the MAA antigens in those selected organs were also detected in the cytoplasm with different cell types. Specifically, MAA antigen was distributed in epithelioid macrophages and necrotic centres within the liver, lung, spleen and kidney, while they were observed in macrophages of the lamina propria and duodenal glands and degenerative myocytes in the pectoralis muscle. This comparative study provides an important insight into the distribution of MAA in infected domestic ducks and indicates that the detection rate by IHC was higher than that of ZN staining.
109	31754106	Full-length transcriptome sequencing from multiple tissues of duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Yin Z, Zhang F, Smith J, Kuo R, Hou ZC	Sci Data	 2019 Nov 21;6(1):275	 doi: 101038/s41597-019-0293-1	Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), one of the most economically important waterfowl, is an ideal model for studying the immune protection mechanism of birds. An incomplete duck reference genome and very limited availability of full-length cDNAs has hindered the identification of alternatively spliced transcripts and slowed down many basic studies in ducks. We applied PacBio Iso-Seq technologies to multiple tissues from duck for use in transcriptome sequencing. We obtained 199,993 full-length transcripts and comprehensively annotated these transcripts. 23,755 lncRNAs were predicted from all identified transcripts and 35,031 alternative splicing events, which divided into 5 models, were accurately predicted from 3,346 genes. Our data constitute a large increase in the known number of both lncRNA, and alternatively spliced transcripts of duck and plays an important role in improving current genome annotation. In addition, the data will be extremely useful for functional studies in other birds.
110	31741265	Inter genotype differences in expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism in the establishment of hepatic steatosis in Muscovy, Pekin and mule ducks.	Tavernier A, Davail S, Houssier M, Bernadet MD, Ricaud K, Gontier K	Mol Biol Rep	 2020 Feb;47(2):1527-1533	 doi: 101007/s11033-019-05182-y Epub 2019 Nov 19	In waterfowls, overfeeding leads to a hepatic steatosis, also called "foie gras". Our main objectives were to determine what is the share of genes involvement of glucose metabolism in the establishment of fatty liver in three genotypes of waterfowls: Muscovy (Cairina moschata), Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and their crossbreed, the mule duck. 288 male ducks of Pekin, Muscovy and mule genotypes were reared until weeks 12 and overfed between weeks 12 and 14. We analysed gene expression at the beginning, the middle and the end of the overfeeding period in different tissues. We have shown an upregulation of glucose transporters (GLUT) in peripheral tissues (pectoralis major or adipose tissue) in Pekin ducks. In addition, GLUT2 was not found in jejunal mucosa and another GLUT seems to replace it 3 h after the meal: GLUT3. Mule ducks upregulating GLUT3 earlier compared to Pekin ducks. However, these results need further investigations. In liver, globally, Pekin ducks exhibit the highest expression of GLUT or enzymes implicated in glycolysis. The few significant variations of gene expressions in glucose metabolism between these three genotypes and the momentary specific overexpression of GLUT do not allow us to detect a lot of specific genotype differences. To conclude, the differences in response to overfeeding of Pekin, Muscovy and mule ducks, for the establishment of hepatic steatosis, cannot be only explained by the glucose metabolism at transcriptomic level.
111	31724070	Cellular elements organization in the trachea of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) with a special reference to its local immunological role.	Mokhtar DM, Hussien MM	Protoplasma	 2020 Mar;257(2):407-420	 doi: 101007/s00709-019-01444-5 Epub 2019 Nov 13	Many studies have been carried out to investigate the histological structure of the trachea in many species of birds. However, the cellular organization of the trachea in the mallard duck is still unclear. This study was performed on 12 sexually mature male Mallard duck to demonstrate the cellular organization of the trachea using light and electron microscopy. The tracheal epithelium is considered the first line of defense against airborne pathogens. The mallard trachea was lined by a pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium that contained many morphologically distinct cell types: ciliated, non-ciliated, basal cells that encircled by a population of sub-epithelial immune cells, fibroblasts, and telocytes (TCs). Telocytes were first recorded in duck trachea in this study and showed a wide variety of staining affinity. They presented two long telopodes that made up frequent close contacts with epithelium, tracheal cartilages, and other neighboring TCs, immune cells, blood capillaries, and nerve fibers. TCs express VEGF and S-100 protein. The immune cells include mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and dendritic reticular cells. The ciliated tracheal epithelium was interrupted by numerous intraepithelial mucous glands and solitary goblet cells. This mucociliary apparatus constitutes the major defense mechanism against inhaled foreign materials. The cellular organization of the duck trachea and its relation to the immunity was discussed.
112	31662999	Integrated Analysis of mRNA Expression, CpG Island Methylation, and Polymorphisms in the MITF Gene in Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lin R, Lin W, Zhou S, Chen Q, Pan J, Miao Y, Zhang M, Huang Z, Xiao T	Biomed Res Int	 2019 Sep 23;2019:8512467	 doi: 101155/2019/8512467 eCollection 2019	Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a key regulator for the development and function of melanocytes in skin, eye, and plumage pigmentations. Thus, the MITF was selected as a candidate gene associated with plumage coloration in ducks. This study analyzed the mRNA expression, promoter methylation, and polymorphisms in the MITF gene in ducks with different plumage colors (Putian Black, Putian White, Liancheng White, and Longsheng Jade-green). No expression of the MITF melanin-specific isoform (MITF-M) was detected in white feather bulbs. By contrast, the mRNA expression levels of MITF-M were high in black feather bulbs. Bioinformatics analysis showed that two CpG islands were present in the promoter region of the MITF gene. The methylation level of the second CpG island was significantly lower in black feather bulbs than in white feather bulbs. However, the methylation level of the first CpG island was not different among the feather bulbs with various colors except Liancheng White feather bulbs. The methylation status of the whole CpG island significantly and negatively correlated with the mRNA expression of MITF-M (P < 0.05). Furthermore, four novel SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were identified in the 5'UTR, exon 4, intron 7, and intron 8 of the MITF gene. Allele T in g.39807T>G and allele G in g.40862G>A were the predominant alleles only found in Putian White, whereas the variant A allele in g.32813G>A exhibited a high allele frequency in Liancheng White. Collectively, these results contributed to the understanding of the function of the MITF gene in duck plumage coloration.
113	31605424	Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in zoo birds caused by HA clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 subtype viruses in Japan in winter 2016.	Usui T, Soda K, Sumi K, Ozaki H, Tomioka Y, Ito H, Murase T, Kawamoto T, Miura M, Komatsu M, Imanishi T, Kurobe M, Ito T, Yamaguchi T	Transbound Emerg Dis	 2020 Mar;67(2):686-697	 doi: 101111/tbed13386 Epub 2019 Oct 25	In late 2016, two zoos, one in northern Japan and the other in central Japan, experienced highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, in which multiple zoo birds were infected with H5N6 subtype HPAI virus (HPAIV). Here, we report an overview of these HPAI outbreaks. HPAIV infections were confirmed by virus isolation in three black swans (Cygnus atratus) and three snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) kept in the Omoriyama Zoo hospital. At Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, following the death of a black swan at a zoo pond, nine waterfowl, including two black swans, four cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii leucopareia), two mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and a wigeon (Anas penelope), died after HPAIV infection in isolation facilities. Based on the presence of H5-specific antibodies in their sera, two surviving black swans and a surviving mallard at Higashiyama Zoo appeared to have HPAIV infection, although the virus was not isolated. The detectable levels of antibodies (>/=10 HI) were maintained for at least 5-9 months, as determined by haemagglutinin inhibition test. Isolation of two H5N6 subtype HPAIVs from an open-air pond where affected zoo birds were previously housed at Higashiyama Zoo strongly indicates that wild waterfowl associated with aquatic environments brought the virus to the zoo. The phylogenetic relationships of the 18 isolates indicated direct viral transmission among birds within each zoo. In both zoos, containment of suspected birds in isolation facilities might have allowed the virus spread among birds inside the facility. However, maintaining containment measures and strict sanitation procedures could facilitate successful physical containment and clearance of HPAIV in both zoos.

Migratory waterfowl are considered the natural hosts of HPAI virus, and HPAI viruses are known to be transmitted over long distances during seasonal bird migration. Bird migration is greatly affected by the weather. Many studies have shown the relationship between either autumn or spring bird migration and climate. However, few studies have shown the relationship between annual bird migration and annual weather. This study aimed to establish a model for the number of migratory waterfowl involved in HPAI virus transmission based on meteorological data. From 136 species of waterfowl that were observed at Futatsudate in Miyazaki, Japan, from 2008 to 2016, we selected potential high-risk species that could introduce the HPAI virus into Miyazaki and defined them as 'risky birds'. We also performed cluster analysis to select meteorological factors. We then analysed the meteorological data and the total number of risky birds using a generalised linear mixed model. We selected 10 species as risky birds: Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Northern pintail (Anas acuta), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), Eurasian teal (Anas crecca), Common pochard (Aythya ferina), Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), Northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), Common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), Tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) and Herring gull (Larus argentatus). We succeeded in clustering 35 meteorological factors into four clusters and identified three meteorological factors associated with their migration: (1) the average daily maximum temperature; (2) the mean value of global solar radiation and (3) the maximum daily precipitation. We thus demonstrated the relationship between the number of risky birds and meteorological data. The dynamics of migratory waterfowl was relevant to the risk of an HPAI outbreak, and our data could contribute to cost and time savings in strengthening preventive measures against epidemics.
115	31556839	LIMITED DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO CLADE 2.3.4.4 A/GOOSE/GUANGDONG/1/1996 LINEAGE HIGHLY PATHOGENIC H5 AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS IN NORTH AMERICAN WATERFOWL.	Stallknecht DE, Kienzle-Dean C, Davis-Fields N, Jennelle CS, Bowman AS, Nolting JM, Boyce WM, Crum JM, Santos JJS, Brown JD, Prosser DJ, De La Cruz SEW, Ackerman JT, Casazza ML, Krauss S, Perez DR, Ramey AM, Poulson RL	J Wildl Dis	 2020 Jan;56(1):47-57	 Epub 2019 Sep 26	During 2014, highly pathogenic (HP) influenza A viruses (IAVs) of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage (GsGD-HP-H5), originating from Asia, were detected in domestic poultry and wild birds in Canada and the US. These clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 viruses included reassortants possessing North American lineage gene segments; were detected in wild birds in the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi flyways; and caused the largest HP IAV outbreak in poultry in US history. To determine if an antibody response indicative of previous infection with clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 IAV could be detected in North American wild waterfowl sampled before, during, and after the 2014-15 outbreak, sera from 2,793 geese and 3,715 ducks were tested by blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using both clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HPH5 and North American lineage low pathogenic (LP) H5 IAV antigens. We detected an antibody response meeting a comparative titer-based criteria (HI titer observed with 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 antigens exceeded the titer observed for LP H5 antigen by two or more dilutions) for previous infection with clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 IAV in only five birds, one Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors) sampled during the outbreak and three Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and one Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) sampled during the post-outbreak period. These serologic results are consistent with the spatiotemporal extent of the outbreak in wild birds in North America during 2014 and 2015 and limited exposure of waterfowl to GsGD-HP-H5 IAV, particularly in the central and eastern US.
116	31549541	Sarcocystis rileyi emerging in Hungary: is rice breast disease underreported in the region-	Szekeres S, Juhasz A, Kondor M, Takacs N, Sugar L, Hornok S	Acta Vet Hung	 2019 Sep;67(3):401-406	 doi: 101556/0042019040	Reports of Sarcocystis rileyi-like protozoa ('rice breast disease') from anseriform birds had been rare in Europe until the last two decades, when S. rileyi was identified in northern Europe and the UK. However, despite the economic losses resulting from S. rileyi infection, no recent accounts are available on its presence (which can be suspected) in most parts of central, western, southern and eastern Europe. Between 2014 and 2019, twelve mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were observed to have rice breast disease in Hungary, and the last one of these 12 cases allowed molecular identification of S. rileyi, as reported here. In addition, S. rileyi was molecularly identified in the faeces of one red fox (Vulpes vulpes). The hunting season for mallards in Hungary lasts from mid-August to January, which in Europe coincides with the wintering migration of anseriform birds towards the south. Based on this, as well as bird ringing data, it is reasonable to suppose that the first S. rileyi-infected mallards arrived in Hungary from the north. on the other hand, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), which are final hosts of S. rileyi, are ubiquitous in Hungary, and our molecular finding confirms an already established autochthonous life cycle of S. rileyi in the region. Taken together, this is the first evidence for the occurrence of S. rileyi in Hungary and its region.
117	31541252	Limited changes in the fecal microbiome composition of laying hens after oral inoculation with wild duck feces.	Schreuder J, Velkers FC, Bouwstra RJ, Beerens N, Stegeman JA, de Boer WF, Elbers ARW, van Hooft P, Feberwee A, Bossers A, Jurburg SD	Poult Sci	 2019 Dec 1;98(12):6542-6551	 doi: 103382/ps/pez526	Interspecies transmission of fecal microbiota can serve as an indicator for (indirect) contact between domestic and wild animals to assess risks of pathogen transmission, e.g., avian influenza. Here, we investigated whether oral inoculation of laying hens with feces of wild ducks (mallards, Anas platyrhynchos) resulted in a hen fecal microbiome that was detectably altered on community parameters or relative abundances of individual genera. To distinguish between effects of the duck inoculum and effects of the inoculation procedure, we compared the fecal microbiomes of adult laying hens resulting from 3 treatments: inoculation with wild duck feces (duck), inoculation with chicken feces (auto), and a negative control group with no treatment. We collected cloacal swabs from 7 hens per treatment before (day 0), and 2 and 7 D after inoculation, and performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. No distinguishable effect of inoculation with duck feces on microbiome community (alpha and beta diversity) was found compared to auto or control treatments. At the individual taxonomic level, the relative abundance of the genus Alistipes (phylum Bacteroidetes) was significantly higher in the inoculated treatments (auto and duck) compared to the control 2 D after inoculation. Seven days after inoculation, the relative abundance of Alistipes had increased in the control and no effect was found anymore across treatments. These effects might be explained by the perturbation of the hen's microbiome caused by the inoculation procedure itself, or by intrinsic temporal variation in the hen's microbiome. This experiment shows that a single inoculation of fecal microbiota from duck feces to laying hens did not cause a measurable alteration of the gut microbiome community. Furthermore, the temporary change in relative abundance for Alistipes could not be attributed to the duck feces inoculation. These outcomes suggest that the fecal microbiome of adult laying hens may not be a useful indicator for detection of single oral exposure to wild duck feces.
118	33365889	The complete mitochondrial genome of the gadwall (Anas strepera).	Wei Q, Wu X, Hu Y, Sun G, Chen J, Gao X, Sha W, Zhang H	Mitochondrial DNA B Resour	 2019 Sep 20;4(2):3141-3142	 doi: 101080/2380235920191667277	The gadwall Anas strepera was widely distributed migratory duck in the family of Anatidae. The complete mitochondrial genome of gadwall was sequenced in this study to explore the mitogenomic characteristics and figure out its phylogenetic relationships within Anatidae. The mitogenome is a circular DNA molecule of 16600 bp in length with 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes and a control region. The overall base composition of the mitogenome was A: 28.84%, T: 22.19%, G: 16.15%, C: 32.81%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Anas strepera was closed to Anas platyrhynchos.
119	31532732	SUSCEPTIBILITY OF LAUGHING GULLS (LEUCOPHAEUS ATRICILLA) AND MALLARDS (ANAS PLATYRHYNCHOS) TO RUDDY TURNSTONE (ARENARIA INTERPRES MORINELLA) ORIGIN TYPE A INFLUENZA VIRUSES.	Bahnson CS, Poulson RL, Hollander LP, Crum Bradley JA, Stallknecht DE	J Wildl Dis	 2020 Jan;56(1):167-174	 Epub 2019 Sep 18	Delaware Bay, US is the only documented location where influenza A virus (IAV) is consistently detected in a shorebird species, the Ruddy Turnstone (RUTU; Arenaria interpres morinella). Although IAV in shorebirds has been well studied at this site for decades, the importance of other species in the avian community as potential sources for the IAVs that infect RUTUs each spring remains unclear. We determined the susceptibility of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Laughing Gulls (Leucophaeus atricilla), to IAVs isolated from RUTUs in order to gain insight into the potential host range of these viruses. Captive-reared gulls were challenged with RUTU-origin H6N1, H10N7, H11N9, H12N4, and H13N6 IAV, as well as Mallard-origin H6N1 and H11N9. We challenged captive-reared Mallards with the same viruses, except for H13N6. At a biologically plausible challenge dose (10(4) 50% embryo infective doses/0.1 mL), one of five gulls challenged with both H6N1 IAVs shed virus. The remaining gulls were resistant to infection with all viruses. In contrast, all Mallards were infected and shed virus. The H12N4 Mallard challenge group was an exception with no birds infected. These results indicated that Mallards are permissive to infection with viruses originating from a shorebird host and that interspecies transmission could occur. In contrast, host adaptation of IAVs to RUTUs may compromise their ability to be transmitted back to gulls.
120	31509442	Molecular cloning, characterisation, and expression analysis of adipocyte fatty acid binding protein gene in Xupu goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus).	Liu X, Xu M, Qu X, Guo S, Liu Y, He C, He J, Liu W	Br Poult Sci	 2019 Dec;60(6):659-665	 doi: 101080/0007166820191655709 Epub 2019 Sep 11	1. Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) plays a key role in fatty acid uptake and intracellular transport. The objective of the present study was to identify and characterise the A-FABP gene in Xupu goose.2. The full-length cDNA of goose A-FABP gene was cloned from the liver tissue using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The distribution of the goose A-FABP in different tissues was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).3. The results showed that the full-length cDNA sequence of goose A-FABP was 657 bp, containing a 5'-UTR of 52 bp, a 3'-UTR of 206 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 399 bp, which encoded a polypeptide of 132 amino acids (AA).4. The AA sequence of goose A-FABP showed 76.52%, 75.00%, 93.18% and 99.24% identities with previously described homologues from humans (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus), and duck (Anas platyrhynchos), respectively, and phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship among them. The transcript of Xupu goose A-FABP was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues, and showed a high-level expression in abdominal fat, sebum and liver.5. A significant positive correlation was identified between A-FABP mRNA abundance in the three adipose tissues and liver weight, ratio of liver to body weight, TG content, and VLDL concentration in the plasma of Xupu goose. A significant negative correlation was observed between the mRNA level of A-FABP and HDL concentration in the plasma of Xupu goose.6. These findings provide a foundation for further research on the function and mechanism of A-FABP in the fat deposition process.
121	31474416	The duck EB66(R) cell substrate reveals a novel retrotransposon.	Perugi F, Freslon-Evain C, Batard L, Guillet P, Schwamborn K	Biologicals	 2019 Sep;61:22-31	 doi: 101016/jbiologicals201908001 Epub 2019 Aug 30	During the establishment of the duck EB66(R) cell line as a new cell substrate for vaccine production in industry, a very low level of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was detected in the culture supernatant by product-enhanced RT assay but a whole battery of tests failed to evidence infectious particles. Results from extensive biochemical and physical testing demonstrated that RT activity was associated to an intracellular, non-enveloped and dense structure different from an infectious retroviruses. In silico analysis of Anas platyrhynchos genome revealed that the most likely candidates for encoding a ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-associated RT were nine copies of chicken repeat 1 (CR1)-like elements, belonging to the non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons. The presence of the full length Anas platyrhynchos chicken repeat 1-like sequence (APCR1) was confirmed in EB66(R) cells and the related ribonucleic acid was present in the RT-containing fraction of EB66(R) cells.
122	31441617	Prokaryotic expression and transmembrane transfer of fusion protein TAT-RIG-I-GFP	Sheng X, Huang D, Guo H, Liu X, Qin Z	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	 2019 Aug 25;35(8):1463-1468	 doi: 1013345/jcjb190110	We studied the construction of fusion protein TAT-RIG-I-GFP prokaryotic expression vector and verified the function of TAT in transmembrane delivery. First, four pairs of specific primers were designed, and the RIG-I gene of Mallard Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was cloned. Then, the pET-TAT-RIG-I-GFP and pET-RIG-I-GFP prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed. Meanwhile, they were converted to E. coli BL21 (DE3), which were induced to be expressed after culture. After the purification of His-60 nickel affinity chromatography column and the identification of SDS-PAGE, the purified TAT-RIG-I-GFP and RIG-I-GFP proteins were incubated to DF-1 cells. Finally, fluorescence microscopy was used to observe whether the corresponding fluorescence was produced in DF-1 cells. The results showed that pET-TAT-RIG-I-GFP fusion with TAT showed obvious green fluorescence in DF-1 cells. However, the pET-RIG-I-GFP without TAT cannot display green fluorescence. This shows that TAT-fused protein have successfully delivered DF-1 cells and play a key role in transmembrane delivery. In conclusion, these results provide a solid material basis for further study of antiviral drugs in poultry.
123	31435964	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alfaxalone after a single intramuscular or intravascular injection in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Kruse TN, Messenger KM, Bowman AS, Aarnes TK, Wittum TE, Flint M	J Vet Pharmacol Ther	 2019 Nov;42(6):713-721	 doi: 101111/jvp12804 Epub 2019 Aug 21	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alfaxalone was performed in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) after single bolus injections of 10 mg/kg administered intramuscularly (IM; n = 10) or intravenously (IV; n = 10), in a randomized cross-over design with a washout period between doses. Mean (+/-SD) Cmax following IM injection was 1.6 (+/-0.8) microg/ml with Tmax at 15.0 (+/-10.5) min. Area under the curve (AUC) was 84.66 and 104.58 min*mg/ml following IV and IM administration, respectively. Volume of distribution (VD ) after IV dose was 3.0 L/kg. The mean plasma clearance after 10 mg/kg IV was 139.5 (+/-67.9) ml min(-1) kg(-1) . Elimination half-lives (mean [+/-SD]) were 15.0 and 16.1 (+/-3.0) min following IV and IM administration, respectively. Mean bioavailability at 10 mg/kg IM was 108.6%. None of the ducks achieved a sufficient anesthetic depth for invasive procedures, such as surgery, to be performed. Heart and respiratory rates measured after administration remained stable, but many ducks were hyperexcitable during recovery. Based on sedation levels and duration, alfaxalone administered at dosages of 10 mg/kg IV or IM in mallard ducks does not induce clinically acceptable anesthesia.
124	31356812	Molecular and pharmacological characterization of poultry (Gallus gallus, Anas platyrhynchos, Anser cygnoides domesticus) and pig (Sus scrofa domestica) melanocortin-5 receptors and their mutants.	Min T, Liu M, Zhang H, Liu Y, Wang Z	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2019 Nov 1;283:113233	 doi: 101016/jygcen2019113233 Epub 2019 Jul 26	The melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily that plays a critical role in lipid production, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, and adipocyte lipolysis. Although multiple functions and important value of MC5R in human beings have been fully demonstrated, however, the potential molecular cloning, pharmacological characteristics and key amino acids in poultry and pig were still not fully understood. Herein, we successfully cloned MC5R genes from chicken (Gallus gallus, cMC5R), duck (Anas platyrhynchos, dMC5R), goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus, gMC5R) and pig (Sus scrofa domestica, pMC5R), and compared their genetic and protein difference with hMC5R through phylogenetic analysis and homology models. Besides, we constructed three alanine-substitution mutants for each of MC5Rs through homologous reorganization, including c/d/gMC5R-D119A/F254A/H257A and pMC5R-D204A/F339A/H342A. Subsequently, we focused our investigation on the pharmacological characterization of four wide-type MC5Rs and their mutants in HEK293T cells, including the intracellular cAMP generation and phosphorylation level of ERK1/2. The results showed that these mutants had decreased cAMP levels under the stimulation of ligands, in spite of enhanced basal activity for c/d/gF254A and pH342A, indicating their important roles in the location and activation of receptors. Notably, these MC5Rs and mutants displayed significant species-specific phenotypes in the activation of pERK1/2 with ligands, which was not completely consistent with hMC5R. These findings demonstrated that presence of interspecies differences for MC5Rs, particularly for the pERK1/2 pathway. Taken together, our study expands current knowledge about the molecular and pharmacological characterization of c/d/g/pMC5Rs, providing preliminary data for MC5R-targeted drug screening or genetic breeding of economic animals in the future.
125	31331531	Effect of incubation temperature on sex-dependent embryo mortality and morphological traits in Mallard.	Kolackova M, Kreisinger J, Albrecht T, Horak D	J Therm Biol	 2019 Jul;83:95-102	 doi: 101016/jjtherbio201905007 Epub 2019 May 16	Although birds have genetically determined sex, the sex ratio has been reported to deviate from parity in several studies. Temperature-dependent sex determination, which is common in reptiles, is absent in birds. However, females are able to adjust their investment into eggs according to the sex of the embryo, which may cause sex-specific embryonic mortality. Incubation temperature may also cause sex-biased embryonic mortality, and it may differentially affect the phenotype of male and female hatchlings. We aimed to investigate differences between male and female Mallard embryos regarding their egg size, mortality during incubation and hatchling phenotype in relation to incubation temperature. Mallard eggs were incubated under six constant incubation temperatures (ranging from 35.0 to 38.0 degrees C). Hatchlings were weighed, and their morphological traits were measured. We determined the sex of hatchlings and unhatched embryos by genetic analysis and found higher male embryonic mortality at 35.5 degrees C (44 males vs. 28 females) and a higher proportion of female hatchlings at 38 degrees C (24 males vs. 38 females); however, these results were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that Mallard females do not differentiate quantitatively between sexes during egg production. Male hatchlings were significantly larger but not heavier than females. The size difference between sexes was most pronounced at temperatures around 36 degrees C, which is the mean temperature of naturally incubated Mallard eggs.
126	31310637	Water body type and group size affect the flight initiation distance of European waterbirds.	Mayer M, Natusch D, Frank S	PLoS One	 2019 Jul 16;14(7):e0219845	 doi: 101371/journalpone0219845 eCollection 2019	Human encroachment on nature grows constantly, increasing human-wildlife interactions. Flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which animals flee from an approaching threat) is often used to measure antipredator behaviour and establish buffer zones to reduce human impact on wildlife. In this study, we approached 10 waterbird species on larger lakes and narrower rivers using a motorboat. We investigated whether water body type, season (winter/spring), approach starting distance, species body mass, and group size influenced bird FID. Average bird FID was 145 +/- 92 m and differed between species. In general, FID of all species was larger on lakes than rivers and increased with increasing group size and approach starting distance. When analysed separately for the two most common species, common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), FID increased with increasing starting distance on rivers, but not lakes, likely because birds on lakes have enough time to evaluate the approaching object and take flight at great distance. Additionally, birds might perform different activities on lakes versus rivers, leading to varying energetic trade-offs between the two habitat types, which may affect the decision when to take flight. Finally, mallards aggregated in larger groups on lakes, which affected FID, likely due to enhanced visibility (i.e., earlier detection of the approaching boat) and detection probability (via increased group size) on lakes. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for habitat characteristics, such as water body type, when studying waterbird FID, because they can affect the visibility of stimuli, group size and potentially animal behaviour, factors which should be taken into account when planning buffer zones for waterbirds in conservation areas.
127	31298292	Relation to enterocins and herbal extracts of fecal hemolytic Escherichia coli from domestic ducks detected with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.	Scerbova J, Kandricakova A, Hamarova L, Laukova A	Poult Sci	 2019 Nov 1;98(11):5925-5931	 doi: 103382/ps/pez371	Surveillance studies have generally reported an increase in Escherichia coli strains resistant to major classes of antibiotics used for animals' treatment. The aim of this study was to test the susceptibility of 25 strains (isolated from 30 domestic Mallard ducks-Anas platyrhynchos, both sex, aged 8 to 14 wk, taxonomically alloted to the species E. coli using MALDI TOF mass spectrometry system) to antimicrobials (antibiotics, enterocins, and herbal extracts). Testing was performed using the agar disc method and the agar diffusion method. A total of 19 E. coli strains were multiresistant to antibiotics; but 10 of those strains were susceptible to enterocins with an inhibition activity of 100 AU/mL. All strains were susceptible to herbal extracts. These results indicate further benefit application of enterocins and herbal extracts to prevent/reduce problems caused with E. coli. Moreover, additional studies are in process.
128	31269347	Polymorphic analysis of peptide binding domain of major histocompatibility complex class I in domestic ducks.	Yu S, Wu J, Bai J, Ding Y, Qiu W, Zhang L	Pol J Vet Sci	 2019 Jun;22(2):415-422	 doi: 1024425/pjvs2019129302	Function of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) major histocompatibility complex class I (Anpl-MHC I) molecules in binding peptides is through the peptide binding groove (PBG), which is thought to be influenced by the high polymorphism of alpha1 and alpha2 domains. However, little is known about the polymorphism of Anpl-MHC I peptide binding domain (PBD), especially in the domestic duck. Here, we analyzed the polymorphism of forty-eight Anpl-MHC I alpha1 and alpha2 domains from domestic duck breeds previously reported. All sequences were analyzed through multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The coefficient of variance of the peptide binding domains (PBDs) from WS, CV, JD, and SX duck breeds was estimated based on the Wu-Kabat variability index, followed by the location of the highly variable sites (HVSs) on reported crystal structure models. Analysis of alpha1 and alpha2 domains showed common features of classical MHC class I and high polymorphism, especially in alpha1 domain. The constructed phylogenetic tree showed that PBDs of domestic ducks did not segregate based on breeds and had a close phylogenetic relationship, even with wild ducks. In each breed, HVSs were mostly located in the PBG, suggesting that they might determine peptide-binding characteristics and subsequently influence peptide presentation and recognition. The combined results of sequence data and crystal structure provide novel valuable insights into the polymorphism and diversity of Anpl-MHC I PBDs that will facilitate further studies on disease resistance differences between duck breeds and the development of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope vaccines suited for preventing diseases in domestic ducks.
129	31251539	Clade 2.3.4.4 H5 North American Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses Infect, but Do Not Cause Clinical Signs in, American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes).	Spackman E, Prosser DJ, Pantin-Jackwood M, Stephens CB, Berlin AM	Avian Dis	 2019 Jun 1;63(2):366-370	 doi: 101637/11950-081418-ResNote1	Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) from the goose/Guangdong/1996 clade 2.3.4.4 H5 lineage spread from Asia into North America in 2014, most likely by wild bird migrations. Although several variants of the virus were detected, H5N8 and H5N2 were the most widespread in North American wild birds and domestic poultry. In early 2015, the H5N2 virus spread through commercial poultry in the Midwest, and >50 million chickens and turkeys died or had to be culled. Related H5 HPAIVs are still endemic in much of the Eastern Hemisphere. The wild bird species that were involved with dissemination of the virus in North America are not known. Dabbling ducks, especially mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), typically have the highest detection rates for avian influenza viruses. To better characterize the wild avian species that could spread the virus, American black ducks (Anas rubripes), which are closely related to mallards, were challenged with the North American H5N2 and H5N8 index HPAIV isolates: A/Northern Pintail/WA/40964/2014 H5N2 and A/Gyrfalcon/WA/41088/2014 H5N8. Although the American black ducks could be infected with low doses of both isolates (</=10(2) 50% egg infective doses), ducks shed the H5N2 longer than the H5N8 (10 vs. 7 days) and the titers of virus shed were higher. Although there were too few ducks available on which to draw definitive conclusions, this suggests that American black ducks could serve as a more efficient reservoir for the H5N2 virus than the H5N8 virus.
130	31251524	Efficacy of Two Licensed Avian Influenza H5 Vaccines Against Challenge with a 2015 U.S. H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus in Domestic Ducks.	Pantin-Jackwood MJ, DeJesus E, Costa-Hurtado M, Smith D, Chrzastek K, Kapczynski DR, Suarez DL	Avian Dis	 2019 Mar 1;63(1):90-96	 doi: 101637/11895-050918-Reg1	Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4 viruses from the H5 goose/Guangdong lineage caused a major outbreak in poultry in the United States in 2015. Although the outbreak was controlled, vaccines were considered as an alternative control method, and new vaccines were approved and purchased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Stockpile for emergency use. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of two of these vaccines in protecting Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) against challenge with a H5N2 HPAI poultry isolate. A recombinant alphavirus-based vaccine and an inactivated adjuvanted reverse genetics vaccine, both expressing the hemagglutinin gene of a U.S. H5 clade 2.3.4.4 isolate (A/Gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 H5N8), were used to immunize the ducks. The vaccines were given either as single vaccination at 2 days of age or in a prime-boost strategy at 2 and 15 days of age. At 32 days of age, all ducks were challenged with A/turkey/Minnesota/12582/15 H5N2 HPAI virus clade 2.3.4.4. All ducks from the nonvaccinated challenge control group became infected and shed virus; one duck in this group presented mild ataxia, and a second duck died. No mortality or clinical signs were observed in vaccinated and challenged ducks, with the exception of one duck presenting with mild ataxia. Both vaccines, regardless of the vaccination strategy used, were immunogenic in ducks and reduced or prevented virus shedding after challenge. In conclusion, good protection against H5Nx infection was achieved in ducks vaccinated with the vaccines examined, which were homologous to the challenge virus, with prime-boost strategies conferring the best protection against infection.
131	31237879	Exploring differentially expressed key genes related to development of follicle by RNA-seq in Peking ducks (Anas Platyrhynchos).	Ren J, Sun C, Chen L, Hu J, Huang X, Liu X, Lu L	PLoS One	 2019 Jun 25;14(6):e0209061	 doi: 101371/journalpone0209061 eCollection 2019	Duck follicles enter different reproductive phases throughout life, and follicle gene expression patterns differ according to these phases. In particular, differentially expressed genes and related to development of follicle (mRNAs) play an important role to explore the key genes in this process; however, the expression profiles of these genes remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was used to investigate the expression levels of duck ovarian genes, and comparative transcriptional analysis was carried out to identify differential genes, and cluster them into groups and function identification. The results showed differential expression of 593 coding genes between young and laying ducks, and of 518 coding genes between laying and old ducks. In further GO analysis, 35 genes from the comparison between old ducks and laying ducks have significant been changed involved in hormones related to follicle development. They include up-regulated genes StAR, CYP17, EPOX, 3beta-HSD, CYP1B1 CYP19A1 and down-regulated genes SR-B1 in laying ducks hormone synthesis than old ducks. Among which EPOX is a key gene for time special highly expression during egg laying stage, and other key regulatory genes' highly expression showed in young and laying stage, and lower expression showing with follicular development stopping. Therefore, EPOX is a key regulator for duck follicle development in laying period, its expression level increase 100 times higher than in youth and decrease 98% than stop laying period in duck life cycle.
132	31183592	Ducklings imprint on chromatic heterogeneity.	Martinho-Truswell A, McGregor B, Kacelnik A	Anim Cogn	 2019 Sep;22(5):769-775	 doi: 101007/s10071-019-01273-2 Epub 2019 Jun 10	Avian filial imprinting is a rapid form of learning occurring just after hatching in precocial bird species. The acquired imprint on either or both parents goes on to affect the young bird's survival and social behaviour later in life (Bateson in Biol Rev 41:177-217, 1966). The imprinting mechanism is specialized but flexible, and causes the hatchling to develop high-fidelity recognition and attraction to any moving stimulus of suitable size seen during a predefined sensitive period. It has been observed (Martinho and Kacelnik in Science 353:286-288, 2016; Versace et al. in Anim Cogn 20:521-529, 2017) that in addition to visual and acoustic sensory inputs, imprinting may incorporate informational rules or abstract concepts. Here we report a study of mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) undergoing imprinting on the chromatic heterogeneity of stimuli, with a focus on how this may be transferred to novel objects. Ducklings were exposed to a series of chromatically heterogeneous or homogeneous stimuli and tested for preference between two novel stimuli, one heterogeneous and the other homogeneous. Exposure to heterogeneity significantly enhanced preference for novel heterogeneous stimuli, relative to ducklings exposed to homogeneous stimuli or unexposed controls. These findings support the view that imprinting does not rely solely on exemplars, or snapshot-like representations of visual input, but that instead young precocial animals form complex multidimensional representations of the target object, involving abstract properties, either at the time of learning, or later, through generalization from the learnt exemplars.
133	31176393	Infection of chicken H9N2 influenza viruses in different species of domestic ducks.	Wang C, Wang Z, Ren X, Wang L, Li C, Sun Y, Wang M, Tong Q, Sun H, Pu J	Vet Microbiol	 2019 Jun;233:1-4	 doi: 101016/jvetmic201904018 Epub 2019 Apr 12	Domestic ducks are considered as the interface between wild aquatic birds and terrestrial poultry and play an important role in the transmission and evolution of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). However, the infectivity of H9N2 AIVs in different domestic duck species has not been systematically evaluated. Here we investigated the infectivity of various genotypes of chicken H9N2 AIVs in Pekin duck (Anas Platyrhynchos), Mallard duck (Anas Platyrhynchos) and Muscovy duck (Cairina Moschata) through intranasal inoculation. We found that Pekin ducks and Mallard ducks were generally resistant to chicken H9N2 virus infection, while Muscovy ducks were relatively susceptible to H9N2 AIVs. All the tested viruses were isolated from oropharynx, trachea and lung tissues of Muscovy ducks. Additionally, genotype 57 (G57) H9N2 AIVs, which was predominant in chickens since 2010, showed increased virus replication in this duck species, indicating an improved interspecies transmission ability of recent H9N2 viruses from chickens to ducks. Our results demonstrated the role of Muscovy ducks in the ecology of H9N2 AIVs. More attentions should be paid to this host during viral surveillances. Additionally, inactivated H9N2 vaccine may be unnecessarily used in Pekin and Mallard ducks.
134	31131571	Identifying Gaps in Wild Waterfowl Influenza A Surveillance in Ohio, United States.	Nolting JM, Lauterbach SE, Slemons RD, Bowman AS	Avian Dis	 2019 Mar 1;63(sp1):145-148	 doi: 101637/11852-042018-Reg1	The Mississippi Flyway is of utmost importance in monitoring influenza A viral diversity in the natural reservoir, as it is used by approximately 40% of North American migratory waterfowl. In 2008, influenza A virus (IAV) surveillance was initiated in eight states within the flyway during annual southern migration, to gain better insight into the natural history of influenza A viruses in the natural reservoir. More than 45,000 samples have been collected and tested, resulting in hundreds of diverse influenza A viral isolates, but seasonal sampling may not be the best strategy to gain insight into the natural history of IAV. To investigate the progress of this sampling strategy toward understanding the ecology of IAV in wild waterfowl, data from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled nearly year-round in Ohio were examined. Overall, 3,645 samples were collected from mallards in Ohio from 2008 to 2016, with IAV being recovered from 13.6% of all samples collected. However, when data from each month are examined individually, it becomes apparent that the aggregated summary may be providing a misleading view of IAV in Ohio mallards. For instance, in August the frequency of viral recovery is 29.8%, with isolates representing at least 47 hemagglutinin/ neuraminidase (HA/NA) combinations. In November, during the height of southern migration, IAV isolation drops to 6.2%, with only 25 HA/NA combinations being represented. Our biased sampling towards convenience and high IAV recovery has created gaps in the data set, which prohibit a full understanding of the IAV ecology in this waterfowl population.
135	31131568	Prevalence of Influenza A Viruses in Ducks Sampled in Northwestern Minnesota and Evidence for Predominance of H3N8 and H4N6 Subtypes in Mallards, 2007-2016.	Hollander LP, Fojtik A, Kienzle-Dean C, Davis-Fields N, Poulson RL, Davis B, Mowry C, Stallknecht DE	Avian Dis	 2019 Mar 1;63(sp1):126-130	 doi: 101637/11851-041918-Reg1	Long-term comprehensive studies of avian influenza virus subtypes in ducks not only contribute to understanding variations and patterns of subtype diversity, but also can be important in defining seasonal and temporal risks associated with transmission of potentially highly pathogenic H5 and H7 subtypes to domestic poultry. We analyzed influenza A virus (IAV) surveillance data from dabbling ducks collected at an important migratory stopover site in northwestern Minnesota from 2007-2016 and identified prevalence and subtype diversity throughout this period. In total, 13,228 cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs from waterfowl were tested over the 10-year period; the majority of these waterfowl were mallards sampled from late August through late September (n = 9133). From these, 1768 IAVs were isolated (19.4% mean annual prevalence, ranging from 11.0% in 2007 to 32.8% in 2011), and both hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase were identified for 1588. Although subtype diversity and prevalence varied by year, H3 and H4 HA subtypes predominated in all years, accounting for 65.7% of the observed HA subtype diversity. The mechanisms driving this consistent pattern of subtype diversity and predominance are not understood but may include factors at the host, population, and virus level.
136	31110697	Sitting ducklings: Timing of hatch, nest departure, and predation risk for dabbling duck broods.	Peterson SH, Ackerman JT, Herzog MP, Hartman CA, Croston R, Feldheim CL, Casazza ML	Ecol Evol	 2019 Apr 16;9(9):5490-5500	 doi: 101002/ece35146 eCollection 2019 May	For ground-nesting waterfowl, the timing of egg hatch and duckling departure from the nest may be influenced by the risk of predation at the nest and en route to wetlands and constrained by the time required for ducklings to imprint on the hen and be physically able to leave the nest. We determined the timing of hatch, nest departure, and predation on dabbling duck broods using small video cameras placed at the nests of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; n = 26), gadwall (Mareca strepera; n = 24), and cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera; n = 5). Mallard eggs began to hatch throughout the day and night, whereas gadwall eggs generally started to hatch during daylight hours (mean 7.5 hr after dawn). Among all species, duckling departure from the nest occurred during daylight (98%), and 53% of hens typically left the nest with their broods 1-4 hr after dawn. For mallard and gadwall, we identified three strategies for the timing of nest departure: (a) 9% of broods left the nest the same day that eggs began to hatch (6-12 hr later), (b) 81% of broods left the nest the day after eggs began to hatch, and (c) 10% of broods waited 2 days to depart the nest after eggs began to hatch, leaving the nest just after the second dawn (27-42 hr later). Overall, eggs were depredated at 10% of nests with cameras in the 2 days prior to hatch and ducklings were depredated at 15% of nests with cameras before leaving the nest. Our results suggest that broods prefer to depart the nest early in the morning, which may best balance developmental constraints with predation risk both at the nest and en route to wetlands.
137	31077316	De novo assembly of the Indian blue peacock (Pavo cristatus) genome using Oxford Nanopore technology and Illumina sequencing.	Dhar R, Seethy A, Pethusamy K, Singh S, Rohil V, Purkayastha K, Mukherjee I, Goswami S, Singh R, Raj A, Srivastava T, Acharya S, Rajashekhar B, Karmakar S	Gigascience	 2019 May 1;8(5)	 pii: 5488106 doi: 101093/gigascience/giz038	BACKGROUND: The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristanus) is native to South Asia and is the national bird of India. Here we present a draft genome sequence of the male blue peacock using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT). RESULTS: ONT sequencing gave approximately 2.3-fold sequencing coverage, whereas Illumina generated 150-base pair paired-end sequence data at 284.6-fold coverage from 5 libraries. Subsequently, we generated a 0.915-gigabase pair de novo assembly of the peacock genome with a scaffold N50 of 0.23 megabase pairs (Mb). We predict that the peacock genome contains 23,153 protein-coding genes and 75.3 Mb (7.33%) of repetitive sequences. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high-quality assembly of the peacock genome using a hybrid approach of sequences generated by both Illumina and ONT. The long-read chemistry generated by ONT was useful for addressing challenges related to de novo assembly, particularly at regions containing repetitive sequences spanning longer than the read length, and which could not be resolved with only short-read-based assembly. Contig assembly of Illumina short reads gave an N50 of 1,639 bases, whereas with ONT, the N50 increased by >9-fold to 14,749 bases. The initial contig assembly based on Illumina sequencing reads alone gave 685,241 contigs. Further scaffolding on assembled contigs using both Illumina and ONT sequencing reads resulted in a final assembly of 15,025 super-scaffolds, with an N50 of approximately 0.23 Mb. Ninety-five percent of proteins predicted by homology matched with those in a public repository, verifying the completeness of our assembly. Like other phylogenetic studies of avian conserved genes, we found P. cristatus to be most closely related to Gallus gallus, followed by Meleagris gallopavo and Anas platyrhynchos. Compared with the recently published peacock genome assembly, the current, superior, hybrid assembly has greater sequencing depth, fewer non-ATGC sequences, and fewer scaffolds.
138	31049835	Changes in morphology and miRNAs expression in small intestines of Shaoxing ducks in response to high temperature.	Tian Y, Li G, Bu X, Shen J, Tao Z, Chen L, Zeng T, Du X, Lu L	Mol Biol Rep	 2019 Aug;46(4):3843-3856	 doi: 101007/s11033-019-04827-2 Epub 2019 May 2	During summer days the extreme heat may cause damage to the integrity of animal intestinal barrier. Little information is available concerning morphological changes in the duck intestines in response to high temperature. And the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of high temperature-induced intestinal injury remain undefined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play key roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression that influences various biological processes. The purpose of this study was to explore the changes in morphology and miRNA expression profiles of the three intestinal segments (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) of ducks in response to high temperature. Sixty female Shaoxing ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), 60 days old, were allocated in two groups, including control ducks kept at 25 degrees C, and ducks subjected to high ambient temperatures of 30-40 degrees C for 15 successive days, which mimicked the diurnal temperature variations experienced in hot seasons. Three ducks from each group were executed at the end of feeding experiment, and the samples of three intestinal segments were collected for morphological examination and Illumina deep sequencing analyses. Histopathological examination of the intestinal mucous membrane was performed with HE staining method. The results demonstrated that varying degrees of damage to each intestinal segment were found in heat-treated ducks, and there were more severe injuries in duodenum and jejunum than those in ileum. Illumina high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic methods were employed in this study to identify the miRNA expression profile of three different intestinal tissues in control and heat-treated ducks. A total of 75,981,636, 88,345,563 and 100,179,422 raw reads were obtained from duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively, from which 74,797,633 clean reads in duodenal libraries, 86,406,445 clean reads in jejunal libraries, and 98,518,858 lean reads in ileal libraries were derived after quality control, respectively. And a total of 276 known and 182 novel miRNAs were identified in the three intestinal segments of ducks under control and heat-treated conditions. By comparing the same tissues in different conditions, 16, 18 and 15 miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed between control and heat-treated ducks in duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively, of which 1 miRNA was expressed in both the duodenum and jejunum, 2 miRNAs were expressed in both the duodenum and ileum, and 3 miRNAs were found to be expressed in both the jejunum and ileum. In addition, two differentially expressed miRNAs in each comparison were randomly selected and validated by quantitative qRT-PCR. Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed miRNAs may be involved in the high temperature-induced intestinal injury in ducks. Our work provides the comprehensive miRNA expression profiles of small intestines in the normal and heat-treated ducks. These findings suggest the involvement of specific molecular mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation to explain the high temperature-induced changes in the duck small intestine.

The virus was isolated from a wild mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) in eastern Kazakhstan. Here, we present the near-complete genome sequence of the virus.
140	31046421	Molecular cloning and functional characterisation of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3.	Zhou Y, Zhou Y, Kang X, Meng C, Zhang R, Guo Y, Xiong D, Song L, Jiao X, Pan Z	Br Poult Sci	 2019 Aug;60(4):357-365	 doi: 101080/0007166820191614528	1. Tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is a key regulator of innate immunity and acquired immunity, and has a salient anti-viral role. 2. In this experiment, the duck TRAF3 (DuTRAF3) gene was cloned according to the Anas platyrhynchos TRAF3 sequence to explore its function. The TRAF3 open reading frame contains 1704 bp that encode a protein of 567 amino acids, which contain a RING finger domain, two zinc finger motifs, a coiled-coil region, and a MATH domain. 3. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that DuTRAF3 was expressed in all the examined tissues, with a comparatively higher expression in the spleen and brain tissues. 4. In HEK293T cells, DuTRAF3 overexpression resulted in a significantly increased NF-kappaB activity and interferon (IFN)-beta promoter activation. 5. Following resiquimod (R848) and poly(I:C) stimulation of duck peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the expressions of TRAF3 and IFN-beta were significantly upregulated; in addition, following R848 stimulation, the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were also significantly upregulated. After infection with the Newcastle Disease Virus LaSota vaccine strain, the mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly upregulated, while that of TRAF3 was downregulated. 6. These results suggest that DuTRAF3 has an important role to play in innate antiviral immune responses.
141	31016183	Dynamic Expression Pattern of SERPINA1 Gene from Duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Gu T, Wu N, Zhang Y, Huang Y, Du J, Lu L, Wu X, Xu Q, Chen G	Biomed Res Int	 2019 Mar 19;2019:1321287	 doi: 101155/2019/1321287 eCollection 2019	SERPINA1 is a member of serine protease inhibitors and is increasingly considered to be a regulator of innate immunity in human and animals. However, the expression and function of SERPINA1 gene in immune defense against viral infection remain unknown in ducks. The full-length du SERPINA1 cDNA sequence was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). It contained 1457 nucleotide, including 47-bp 5' UTR, 135-bp 3' UTR, and 1275-bp open reading frame (ORF), and encodes a 424-amino acid protein. Then, the tissue expression profile of du SERPINA1 gene was determined. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR) analysis revealed that du SERPINA1 mRNA is ubiquitous in various tissues, but higher expression levels were observed in lung and liver tissues. In addition, the expression pattern was investigated when the ducklings were challenged with duck hepatitis virus 1(DHV-1) and polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C). After DHV-1 injection or poly I:C treatment, du SERPINA1 mRNA was up-regulated in the liver and kidney tissues. However, the peak time in two tissues was not consistent. In kidney, the expression lever of SERPINA1 increased immediately after the treatment while in liver tissue it kept steady until 12 h post-infection. Our results indicate that SERPINA1 has an active role in the antiviral response, and thus improve our understanding of the role of this protein.
142	30993577	Comparing erosion and organ accumulation rates of lead and alternative lead-free ammunition fed to captive domestic ducks.	Krone O, Kenntner N, Ebner N, Szentiks CA, Danicke S	Ambio	 2019 Sep;48(9):1065-1071	 doi: 101007/s13280-019-01183-0 Epub 2019 Apr 16	Lead poisoning of birds of prey from ingestion of ammunition lead has been well documented. Alternative, lead-free ammunition is widely available, but the toxicokinetics of other metals in birds are poorly understood. We tested the erosion of lead, copper, zinc, iron and brass by feeding domestic Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos forma domestica) defined numbers of small metal pellets. The accumulation of these metals was analysed in the breast muscle, brain, pancreas, liver and kidney. Four weeks after application, the ducks were euthanized and necropsied, internal organs tested for metal accumulation and gizzard pellets collected and weighed to record loss by erosion. Degree of erosion was highest in zinc pellets (81% mass loss), followed by iron (46%) and lead (45%) and was only marginal in copper and brass. Only lead showed highly elevated levels of accumulation in organs compared to controls.

Han S, Li R, Lin J, Hou X, Weng H, Zhang H, Wang Y, Li N, Chai T, Wei L	Dev Comp Immunol	 2019 Sep;98:205-213	 doi: 101016/jdci201904005 Epub 2019 Apr 12	Galectin-1, as a typical animal galactose-binding protein, it is found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. Cloning the full-length coding sequence of galectin-1 from the spleens of Cherry Valley ducks revealed that the coding sequence of duck galectin-1 (duGal-1) comprises 405 bp, encoding 134 amino acids. Homologic analysis revealed its amino acid sequence is most identical to that of Anas platyrhynchos (98.8%) followed by Gallus gallus. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that duGal-1 mRNA is broadly expressed in healthy Cherry Valley duck tissues, primarily in the heart and trachea but minimally in the lung and skin. Meanwhile, the duGal-1 expression is slightly upregulated in the infected liver and spleen. Furthermore, the expression levels of ISGs (Mx, PKR, OAS) and some cytokines such as IFN-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, are up-regulated to varying degrees after overexpression the duGal-1, In contrast, Knockdown of duGal-1 found that the expression levels of ISGs and some inflammatory cytokines were down-regulated. Antiviral assay showed that duGal-1 could inhibit viral replications early during infection. This is the first study of the cloning, tissue distribution, and antiviral immune responses of duGal-1, and findings imply it is involved in the early stages of antiviral innate immune responses to duck plague virus infections in ducks.
144	30968708	Transcriptional regulatory region and DNA methylation analysis of TNNI1 gene promoters in Gaoyou duck skeletal muscle (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Ji GG, Shu JT, Zhang M, Ju XJ, Shan YJ, Liu YF, Tu YJ	Br Poult Sci	 2019 Jun;60(3):202-208	 doi: 101080/0007166820191602250 Epub 2019 May 29	1. The slow skeletal muscle troponin I (TNNI1) gene has been found to be specifically expressed in slow muscle fibres and plays an important role in muscle development. The aim of this study was to determine the active control area of duck TNNI1 and identify the potential cis-regulatory elements in the promoter. 2. In this study, the TNNI1 promoter was first cloned by genome walking and the sequences were analysed using bioinformatics software. Firefly luciferase reporter gene vectors, driven by a series of constructs with progressive deletions, were used to identify the core transcriptional regulatory region of the duck TNNI1 gene. The methylation status of the CpG island in the TNNI1 promoter was detected in skeletal muscle on embryonic days 21 and 27, by bisulphite sequencing PCR (BSP). 3. The results showed two CpG islands presented in the promoter region, with one of the CpG islands located in the core transcriptional regulatory region (-2078/-885 bp). The total methylation levels of the 14 CpG sites were not altered between breast and leg muscles on embryonic days 21 and 27. However, four CpG sites (loci of positions 4, 11, 13, and 14) showed dramatically different methylation levels between breast and leg muscles at embryonic days 21 and 27. Analysis showed that multiple CpG sites had a significant correlation between the methylation levels of the CpG sites and mRNA expressions in skeletal muscle. Multiple transcription factor binding sites including Sp1, c-Myc, Oct-1 and NF-kB motifs were identified and might be responsible for transcriptional regulation of the TNNI1 gene. 4. These findings contribute to further understanding of the fundamental mechanism for transcriptional regulation of the TNNI1 gene in ducks.
145	30961809	Amyloid A amyloidosis secondary to avian tuberculosis in naturally infected domestic pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Chen H, Zhu D, Wang M, Jia R, Chen S, Liu M, Zhao X, Yang Q, Wu Y, Zhang S, Liu Y, Zhang L, Yu Y, Chen X, Cheng A	Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis	 2019 Apr;63:136-141	 doi: 101016/jcimid201901016 Epub 2019 Feb 2	To investigate the correlation between avian tuberculosis and duck amyloidosis, the liver, lung, spleen, kidney, duodenum and pectoralis muscle of ducks naturally infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium were used to detect amyloidosis by Congo red staining and potassium permanganate-Congo red staining. The expression level of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and SAA2 were detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that the liver, lung, spleen, kidney, duodenum and pectoralis muscle of the infected ducks exhibited amyloid proteins under ordinary light microscopy and the polarization light under polarized light microscopy. However, no amyloid deposition in potassium permanganate-Congo red staining sections indicated that the amyloidosis was AA amyloidosis. In addition, the expression level of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and SAA2 increased from 4 to 43. This study showed that avian tuberculosis could induce secondary amyloidosis in naturally infected ducks.
146	30941418	Comparison of whole embryonic development in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and goose (Anser cygnoides) with the chicken (Gallus gallus).	Li S, Bai S, Qin X, Zhang J, Irwin DM, Zhang S, Wang Z	Poult Sci	 2019 Aug 1;98(8):3278-3291	 doi: 103382/ps/pez133	Embryos from aquatic birds are the primary models for the study of flipper development. While some staging of early embryogenesis in duck have been studied, characterization of the stages of the entire embryonic development period in water birds has not been described. This study aimed to establish a comparison of complete morphological development staging for ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese (Anser cygnoides) with the embryonic staging system by Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) for the chicken (Gallus gallus). Our results show that morphological development in the chicken, duck, and goose are similar in the early stages. The major differences occurred after stage 27 of embryonic development, where the beak shape in ducks and geese was wider and longer than in chickens. In addition, the second and third interdigital webs of the hind limb of the chicken were found to be degraded from stage 31, and eventually vanished at stage 35; however, they were retained in ducks and geese. Rapid physical development occurred in the mid-to-late stages in ducks and geese. To our best knowledge, this is the first description of complete embryonic development for the duck and goose. Establishment of an embryonic staging system for duck and goose provides new models for the study of waterfowl development.
147	30913221	Molecular cytogenetic characterization of repetitive sequences comprising centromeric heterochromatin in three Anseriformes species.	Uno Y, Nishida C, Hata A, Ishishita S, Matsuda Y	PLoS One	 2019 Mar 26;14(3):e0214028	 doi: 101371/journalpone0214028 eCollection 2019	The highly repetitive DNA sequence of centromeric heterochromatin is an effective molecular cytogenetic marker for investigating genomic compartmentalization between macrochromosomes and microchromosomes in birds. We isolated four repetitive sequence families of centromeric heterochromatin from three Anseriformes species, viz., domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos, APL), bean goose (Anser fabalis, AFA), and whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus, CCY), and characterized the sequences by molecular cytogenetic approach. The 190-bp APL-HaeIII and 101-bp AFA-HinfI-S sequences were localized in almost all chromosomes of A. platyrhynchos and A. fabalis, respectively. However, the 192-bp AFA-HinfI-L and 290-bp CCY-ApaI sequences were distributed in almost all microchromosomes of A. fabalis and in approximately 10 microchromosomes of C. cygnus, respectively. APL-HaeIII, AFA-HinfI-L, and CCY-ApaI showed partial sequence homology with the chicken nuclear-membrane-associated (CNM) repeat families, which were localized primarily to the centromeric regions of microchromosomes in Galliformes, suggesting that ancestral sequences of the CNM repeat families are observed in the common ancestors of Anseriformes and Galliformes. These results collectively provide the possibility that homogenization of centromeric heterochromatin occurred between microchromosomes in Anseriformes and Galliformes; however, homogenization between macrochromosomes and microchromosomes also occurred in some centromeric repetitive sequences.
148	30847073	Mallard resource selection trade-offs in a heterogeneous environment during autumn and winter.	Palumbo MD, Petrie SA, Schummer M, Rubin BD, Bonner S	Ecol Evol	 2019 Feb 6;9(4):1798-1808	 doi: 101002/ece34864 eCollection 2019 Feb	Animals select resources to maximize fitness but associated costs and benefits are spatially and temporally variable. Differences in wetland management influence resource availability for ducks and mortality risk from duck hunting. The local distribution of the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is affected by this resource heterogeneity and variable risk from hunting. Regional conservation strategies primarily focus on how waterfowl distributions are affected by food resources during the nonbreeding season. To test if Mallard resource selection was related to the abundance of resources, risks, or a combination, we studied resource selection of adult female Mallards during autumn and winter. We developed a digital spatial layer for Lake St. Clair, Ontario, Canada, that classified resources important to Mallards and assigned these resources a risk level based on ownership type and presumed disturbance from hunting. We monitored 59 individuals with GPS back-pack transmitters prior to, during, and after the hunting season and used discrete choice modeling to generate diurnal and nocturnal resource selection estimates. The model that classified available resources and presumed risk best explained Mallard resource selection strategies. Resource selection varied within and among seasons. Ducks selected for federal, state and private managed wetland complexes that provided an intermediate or relatively greater amount of refuge and foraging options than public hunting areas. Across all diel periods and seasons, there was selection for federally managed marshes and private supplemental feeding refuges that prohibited hunting. Mallard resource selection demonstrated trade-offs related to the management of mortality risk, anthropogenic disturbances, and foraging opportunities. Understanding how waterfowl respond to heterogeneous landscapes of resources and risks can inform regional conservation strategies related to waterfowl distribution during the nonbreeding season.

Jones KR, Garcia GW	Vet Sci	 2019 Mar 6;6(1)	 pii: vetsci6010024 doi: 103390/vetsci6010024	This review serves to summarize parasites found in Domesticated animals which were found in the Neo-Tropics. Indigenous domesticated Neo-tropical animals include South American camelids, (Lama gunacoa, Lama glama, Lama pacos, Vicuna vicuna), guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), chinchillas (Chinchilla lanigera), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and ducks (Cairina moschata, Anas platyrhynchos, Dendrocyga autumnalis). These animals were chosen due to their origin of existence (Neo-tropics) and over time these animals became domesticated and were distributed throughout the world. Over eighty (80) references were collected for this review and the papers spanned over eighty (80) years from 1934 to 2018. The gastrointestinal parasites reported for each animal were tabulated and their effects in the animal noted. Parasites reported in domesticated Neo-tropical animals had little to no effect on wild and free ranging animals with a few cases of illness and decreased productivity. The majority of articles viewed these animals as reservoir host which can infect humans and other domesticated livestock. It must also be noted that research done in the past did not focus on the effect these parasites had on these animals but only observed their potential as reservoirs for parasitic diseases.
150	30794961	Varied effects of dietary carotenoid supplementation on oxidative damage in tissues of two waterfowl species.	Mohr AE, Girard M, Rowe M, McGraw KJ, Sweazea KL	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 2019 May;231:67-74	 doi: 101016/jcbpb201902003 Epub 2019 Feb 19	Carotenoids are regarded as a cornerstone of avian vitality and coloration. Currently, the antioxidant potential of dietary carotenoids is debated for birds. Although some studies support a protective role, others report either no effect or pro-oxidant effects. However, the majority of research on this topic has not analyzed the oxidative status of a series of tissues in animals nor considered a range of carotenoid dosages. We investigated the effects of three levels of carotenoid supplementation on plasma, liver, adipose, heart and breast muscle oxidative damage in two congeneric species of waterfowl that exhibit marked differences in carotenoid coloration. After a 6-week depletion period, captive adult northern pintail (Anas acuta) and mallard (A. platyrhynchos) ducks of both sexes were fed either a carotenoid-depleted diet (<3mug/g xanthophylls, lutein and zeaxanthin), a carotenoid-supplemented diet (50mug/g) within physiological range, or a carotenoid-rich diet (100mug/g) within pharmacological range for 22 to 32weeks. We hypothesized that these dosages of dietary carotenoids would differentially affect oxidative damage between species and sexes and among the tissues examined. We found that dietary xanthophyll supplementation had no significant effect on tissue pro-oxidation in males and females from both species. Moreover, sex or species differences in oxidative stress were only observed in two tissues (plasma and heart). Significant correlations in the levels of oxidative damage were not observed among the tissues examined. In conclusion, the current study does not support a consistent antioxidant role for dietary carotenoids in the tissues of these two waterfowl species. Instead, our results align with the notion that carotenoids play complex, tissue- and species-specific roles in oxidative status in birds.
151	30771205	Danish pheasant and mallard hunters comply with the lead shot ban.	Kanstrup N, Balsby TJS	Ambio	 2019 Sep;48(9):1009-1014	 doi: 101007/s13280-019-01152-7 Epub 2019 Feb 15	Denmark implemented a total ban on the use of lead shot for hunting and clay target shooting in 1996. Compliance was not studied systematically until recently. However, sporadic police checks and individual studies indicated that compliance was far from complete in the early years after regulation. To assess current levels of compliance with Danish regulations, we purchased 730 carcasses of pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and a further 690 mallard gizzards were obtained from > 14 shooting events distributed across > 10 local authority districts throughout East and West Denmark in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 hunting seasons. All carcasses and gizzards were subject to radiography and those that contained shot were examined, pellets removed by dissection and identified to shot type. In all, 3589 pellets (intact or fragmented) were found in 1420 carcasses/gizzards, of which 799 pellets (some fragmented) were identified. Among the sample of pheasants with embedded shot (N = 447), 1.8% (in 2016) and 2.2% (in 2017) were lead shot. Among 148 mallards in 2017 with embedded shot, 3.1% had lead shot. None of the 2017 mallard gizzards had embedded lead shot. We conclude that Danish pheasant and mallard shooters mostly comply with the lead shot regulations. Steel was the most used non-lead alternative. The majority of ingested shot was non-lead, indicating that lead shot is not generally available to pheasant and mallard and suggesting compliance with regulations in recent years/decades. The study showed that the possibility to predict the metal composition of shot pellets from X-ray images alone was highly inaccurate, confirming the necessity of necropsy to determine shot type.
152	30720248	Comparative pathogenicity of H5N6 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in chicken, Pekin duck and Muscovy duck.	Uchida Y, Mine J, Takemae N, Tanikawa T, Tsunekuni R, Saito T	Transbound Emerg Dis	 2019 May;66(3):1227-1251	 doi: 101111/tbed13141 Epub 2019 Feb 27	In Japan during the 2016-2017 winter season, clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of the H5N6 subtype caused 12 outbreaks in chicken and Muscovy duck farms. These viruses have been circulating in Vietnam and China since 2014. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of chicken, Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) to H5N6 HPAIVs that originated in Japan, Vietnam and China. The H5N6 HPAIVs examined in this study were highly lethal to chickens compared with their pathogenicity in Pekin duck and Muscovy duck. One of five chickens infected with A/Muscovy duck/Aomori/1-3T/2016 (MusDk/Aomori) survived despite viral shedding, although all of the chickens infected with the other viruses died. The 50% chicken lethal dose differed among the Japanese strains that shared the same gene constellation indicating that gene constellation was not a major determinant of pathogenicity in chicken. MusDk/Aomori, A/chicken/Niigata/1-1T/2016 (Ck/Niigata) and A/duck/Hyogo/1/2016 (Dk/Hyogo) infected all Muscovy ducks inoculated; Ck/Niigata killed 50% of the ducks it infected whereas the other two did not kill any ducks. A/chicken/Japan/AnimalQuarantine-HE144/2016 (HE144) isolated from chicken meat that originated in China was highly pathogenic to Pekin duck: all of the ducks died within 3.75 days of inoculation. This study shows that the pathogenicity of the clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs differs not only between hosts but also within the same host species.
153	30701142	Effects of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis infection on egg production and the immune response of the laying duck Anas platyrhynchos.	Zhang Y, Chen Y, Gu T, Xu Q, Zhu G, Chen G	PeerJ	 2019 Jan 25;7:e6359	 doi: 107717/peerj6359 eCollection 2019	Persistent colonization of the avian reproductive tract by Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) negatively affects egg production and contaminates the egg. The immune function of the ovary and oviduct is essential for protection from infection and for the production of wholesome eggs. However, the immune response of laying ducks during SE infection is not well-understood. In this study, ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were infected with SE and were systematically monitored for fecal shedding during a 13-week period. We also assessed bacterial distribution in the reproductive tract and classified infected ducks as resistant or susceptible based on the presence of tissue lesions and on SE isolation from fecal samples. We found that infected animals had persistent, but intermittent, bacterial shedding that resulted in the induction of carrier ducks. Laying rate and egg quality were also decreased after SE infection (P < 0.05). SE readily colonized the stroma, small follicle, isthmus, and vagina in the reproductive tracts of susceptible ducks. Immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, IgM) levels were higher in susceptible ducks compared with resistant birds (P < 0.05); T-lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+)) displayed the opposite trend. qRT-PCR analysis was used to examine expression profiles of immune response genes in the reproductive tract of infected ducks. The analysis revealed that immune genes, including toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4-5, TLR15, TLR21), NOD-like receptors (NOD1, NLRX1, NLRP12), avian beta-defensins (AvbetaD4-5, AvbetaD7, AvbetaD12), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma), and MyD88 were markedly upregulated in the reproductive tracts of SE-infected ducks (all P < 0.05); TLR3, TLR7, NLRC3, NLRC5, and TNF-alpha were significantly downregulated. These results revealed that SE infection promoted lower egg production and quality, and altered the expression of TLRs, NLRs, AvbetaDs, and cytokine family genes. These findings provide a basis for further investigation of the physiological and immune mechanisms of SE infection in laying ducks.
154	30654831	Long-term avian influenza virus epidemiology in a small Spanish wetland ecosystem is driven by the breeding Anseriformes community.	Torrontegi O, Alvarez V, Acevedo P, Gerrikagoitia X, Hofle U, Barral M	Vet Res	 2019 Jan 17;50(1):4	 doi: 101186/s13567-019-0623-5	During 2007-2009 and 2012-2014, avian influenza virus (AIV) was studied in a wild avian community of a northern Spanish wetland using non-invasive sampling methods and host identification by COI barcoding. The aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate AIV dynamics in a natural wetland ecosystem, taking into account both virological aspects and ecological traits of hosts. Global AIV prevalence decreased significantly during the second sampling period (0.3%) compared to the first (6.6%). Circulating subtype distributions were also different between periods, with a noteworthy H5 and H7 subtype richness during the first sampling period. Mallard Anas platyrhynchos was identified as the main AIV host, although not all positive samples could be ascribed to the host. We modelled AIV prevalence with regard to the avian host community composition and meteorological data from the wetland. Statistical analysis revealed seasonal differences in AIV detection, with higher prevalence during the breeding season compared to other phenological events. The model also shows that the lower AIV prevalence during the second study period was associated with a significant reduction of breeding Anseriformes in the wetland, revealing a long-term fluctuation of AIV prevalence driven by the breeding Anseriformes community. This longitudinal study on AIV epidemiology in a natural ecosystem reveals that although prevalence follows seasonal and annual patterns, long-term prevalence fluctuation is linked to the breeding community composition and size. These results are relevant to understanding the influence of host ecology on pathogen transmission for preventing and managing influenza emergence.
155	30634898	Identification and analysis of long non-coding RNAs in response to H5N1 influenza viruses in duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lu C, Xing Y, Cai H, Shi Y, Liu J, Huang Y	BMC Genomics	 2019 Jan 11;20(1):36	 doi: 101186/s12864-018-5422-2	BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important component of mammalian genomes, where their numbers are even larger than that of protein-coding genes. For example, human (Homo sapiens) (96,308 vs. 20,376) and mouse (Mus musculus) (87,774 vs. 22,630) have more lncRNA genes than protein-coding genes in the NONCODEv5 database. Recently, mammalian lncRNAs were reported to play critical roles in immune response to influenza A virus infections. Such observation inspired us to identify lncRNAs related to immune response to influenza A virus in duck, which is the most important natural host of influenza A viruses. RESULTS: We explored features of 62,447 lncRNAs from human, mouse, chicken, zebrafish and elegans, and developed a pipeline to identify lncRNAs using the identified features with transcriptomic data. We then collected 151,970 assembled transcripts from RNA-Seq data of 21 individuals from three tissues and annotated 4094 duck lncRNAs. Comparing to duck protein-coding transcripts, we found that 4094 lncRNAs had smaller number of exons (2.4 vs. 10.2) and longer length of transcripts (1903.0 bp vs. 1686.9 bp) on average. Among them, 3586 (87.6%) lncRNAs located in intergenic regions and 619 lncRNAs showed differential expression in ducks infected by H5N1 virus when compared to control individuals. 58 lncRNAs were involved into two co-expressional modules related to anti-influenza A virus immune response. Moreover, we confirmed that eight lncRNAs showed remarkably differential expression both in vivo (duck individuals) and in vitro (duck embryo fibroblast cells, DEF cells) after infected with H5N1 viruses, implying they might play important roles in response to influenza A virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study presented an example to annotate lncRNA in new species based on model species using transcriptome data. These data and analysis provide information for duck lncRNAs' function in immune response to influenza A virus.
156	30624718	Evidences in duck (Anas platyrhynchos) by transcriptome data for supporting the biliverdin was mainly synthesized by shell gland.	Zhang T, Liu H, Wang J, Li L, Han C, Mustafa A, Xiong X	Poult Sci	 2019 May 1;98(5):2260-2271	 doi: 103382/ps/pey576	The blue-shelled egg not only plays a key role in helping birds to avoid predation as a result of crypsis and mimetism, but it also provides eggshell strength and filters solar radiation; moreover, it has an important economic trait for poultry. However, the source of biliverdin for blue-shelled egg remains unsolved in ducks. The current study detected the biliverdin content and localization of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) in duck shell gland; moreover, RNA-seq analysis was performed in the shell gland of blue-shelled and white-shelled ducks. Results indicated that biliverdin is a primary pigment for blue-shelled egg in ducks, and the HMOX1 protein showed high expression in ciliated epithelial cells of shell gland between blue-shelled and white-shelled ducks. In the pathway of biliverdin synthesis, only 5-aminolevulinate synthase 1 expression level was significantly upregulated in blue-shelled ducks, and nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 1 and period circadian clock 2 may be the essential elements in biliverdin synthesis of duck shell gland. Furthermore, some of the transporter genes, such as activator-Like and solute carrier family 13 member 5, may be involved in the formation of blue egg in duck. Results of the current study suggested that the biliverdin is most likely synthesized and secreted from epithelial cells of shell gland. In addition, ALAS1 may play a key role in the formation of blue egg in ducks.
157	30595026	The recessive C locus in the MITF gene plays a key regulatory role in the plumage colour pattern of duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Yang L, Mo C, Shen W, Du X, Akbar Bhuiyan A, Li L, Li N, Gong Y, Li S	Br Poult Sci	 2019 Apr;60(2):105-108	 doi: 101080/0007166820181564237 Epub 2019 Feb 1	1. The c/c alleles are responsible for the white plumage colour of ducks; however, the gene corresponding to this locus is still unclear. In order to identify the locus-related candidate gene associated with duck's plumage colour pattern, it was necessary to analyse the whole genome resequencing data. 2. A total of 929,465 SNPs in chromosome 13 and 1,688 SNPs in the region of the Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor (MITF) gene were identified from whole genome resequencing data analysis. After construction of an FST plot from chromosome 13, MITF was highlighted as a candidate gene, possessing the highest FST value (0.811) on chromosome 13. 3. Six novel SNPs were discovered, located in the intronic region of the MITF gene. F2 progeny of Kaiya x Liancheng ducks (N = 1,061) were selected for genotyping by the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) technique. Association analysis using Haploview software was used for validation of the results. 4. Association results between SNPs and phenotypes showed significant association with corresponding phenotypes. All the significantly associated SNPs were located in the identified candidate gene. 5. The identified candidate gene provided novel information which is important in marker-assisted selection and breeding of duck and for the investigation of the C locus recessive white genetic mechanisms underlying plumage colour pattern.
158	30502804	Analysis of free and metabolized microcystins in samples following a bird mortality event.	Foss AJ, Miles CO, Samdal IA, Lovberg KE, Wilkins AL, Rise F, Jaabaek JAH, McGowan PC, Aubel MT	Harmful Algae	 2018 Dec;80:117-129	 doi: 101016/jhal201810006 Epub 2018 Nov 3	In the summer of 2012, over 750 dead and dying birds were observed at the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island, Maryland, USA (Chesapeake Bay). Clinical signs suggested avian botulism, but an ongoing dense Microcystis bloom was present in an impoundment on the island. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of a water sample indicated 6000 ng mL(-1) of microcystins (MCs). LC-UV/MS analysis confirmed the presence of MC-LR and a high concentration of an unknown MC congener (m/z 1037.5). The unknown MC was purified and confirmed to be [D-Leu(1)]MC-LR using NMR spectroscopy, LC-HRMS and LC-MS(2), which slowly converted to [D-Leu(1),Glu(OMe)(6)]MC-LR during storage in MeOH. Lyophilized algal material from the bloom was further characterized using LC-HRMS and LC-MS(2) in combination with chemical derivatizations, and an additional 24 variants were detected, including MCs conjugated to Cys, GSH and gamma-GluCys and their corresponding sulfoxides. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) livers were tested to confirm MC exposure. Two broad-specificity MC ELISAs and LC-MS(2) were used to measure free MCs, while 'total' MCs were estimated by both MMPB (3-methoxy-2-methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid) and thiol de-conjugation techniques. Free microcystins in the livers (63-112 ng g(-1)) accounted for 33-41% of total microcystins detected by de-conjugation and MMPB techniques. Free [D-Leu(1)]MC-LR was quantitated in tissues at 25-67 ng g(-1) (LC-MS(2)). The levels of microcystin varied based on analytical method used, highlighting the need to develop a comprehensive analysis strategy to elucidate the etiology of bird mortality events when microcystin-producing HABs are present.
159	30462334	In vitro culture and characterization of duck primordial germ cells.	Chen YC, Lin SP, Chang YY, Chang WP, Wei LY, Liu HC, Huang JF, Pain B, Wu SC	Poult Sci	 2019 Apr 1;98(4):1820-1832	 doi: 103382/ps/pey515	This study aimed to isolate, culture, and characterize duck primordial germ cells (PGCs) and to compare these cells with chicken PGCs. We first cultured Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) circulating PGCs and gonadal PGCs (gPGCs) in the modified serum-containing medium used to amplify chicken PGCs. gPGCs were found to proliferate better in serum-free chemically defined medium than in serum-containing medium. Thereafter, gPGCs were similarly isolated from 2 other duck breeds, the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and the hybrid mule duck (C. moschata x A. platyrhynchos), and amplified for a limited period of time in the chemically defined culture condition, but sufficiently to be characterized and transplanted. Cultured gPGCs of all 3 duck breeds were characterized by Periodic acid-Schiff staining, immunocytochemical staining, and expression analysis of germline-specific and pluripotency genes. Cultured duck gPGCs colonized the gonads after being genetically labeled and injected into recipient embryos. Taken together, these results demonstrate that duck PGCs retain their germline characteristics after being isolated, expanded in vitro, and genetically modified. Further studies are required to establish the optimal conditions for long-term culture of duck PGCs, which may involve supplementing the culture medium with other growth factors or compounds.
160	30425731	Characterization of Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) Short Tandem Repeat Variation by Population-Scale Genome Resequencing.	Fan W, Xu L, Cheng H, Li M, Liu H, Jiang Y, Guo Y, Zhou Z, Hou S	Front Genet	 2018 Oct 30;9:520	 doi: 103389/fgene201800520 eCollection 2018	Short tandem repeats (STRs) are usually associated with genetic diseases and gene regulatory functions, and are also important genetic markers for analysis of evolutionary, genetic diversity and forensic. However, for the majority of STRs in the duck genome, their population genetic properties and functional impacts remain poorly defined. Recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has offered an opportunity for profiling large numbers of polymorphic STRs. Here, we reported a population-scale analysis of STR variation using genome resequencing in mallard and Pekin duck. Our analysis provided the first genome-wide duck STR reference including 198,022 STR loci with motif size of 2-6 base pairs. We observed a relatively uneven distribution of STRs in different genomic regions, which indicates that the occurrence of STRs in duck genome is not random, but undergoes a directional selection pressure. Using genome resequencing data of 23 mallard and 26 Pekin ducks, we successfully identified 89,891 polymorphic STR loci. Intensive analysis of this dataset suggested that shorter repeat motif, longer reference tract length, higher purity, and residing outside of a coding region are all associated with an increase in STR variability. STR genotypes were utilized for population genetic analysis, and the results showed that population structure and divergence patterns among population groups can be efficiently captured. In addition, comparison between Pekin duck and mallard identified 3,122 STRs with extremely divergent allele frequency, which overlapped with a set of genes related to nervous system, energy metabolism and behavior. The evolutionary analysis revealed that the genes containing divergent STRs may play important roles in phenotypic changes during duck domestication. The variation analysis of STRs in population scale provides valuable resource for future study of genetic diversity and genome evolution in duck.
161	30382421	Embryonic development of parakeratinized epithelium of the tongue in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica): LM, SEM, and TEM observations.	Skieresz-Szewczyk K, Jackowiak H, Ratajczak M	Protoplasma	 2019 May;256(3):631-642	 doi: 101007/s00709-018-1324-z Epub 2018 Oct 31	The parakeratinized epithelium is a common and widespread type of keratinized epithelium in the oral cavity in adult birds. In contrast to orthokeratinized epithelium, which mostly covers mechanical papillae and the lingual nail, parakeratinized epithelium covers almost the entire dorsal surface of the tongue in birds. The characteristic feature of parakeratinized epithelium is the presence of nuclei in the keratinized layer. The present study aimed to investigate for the first time the micro- and ultrastructural changes of parakeratinized epithelium during embryonic development and to assess the readiness of the epithelium to serve protective functions during food transport to the esophagus. Three developmental stages were distinguished: embryonic, transformation, and pre-hatching stages. The embryonic stage lasts from the 9th to the 14th day of incubation and the epithelium is composed of undifferentiated epithelial cells. The transformation stage lasts from the 15th to the 22nd day of incubation and the epithelium undergoes transformation into stratified epithelium consisting of basal, intermediate, and superficial layers. The characteristic feature of this stage is formation of the periderm with osmophilic granules. The pre-hatching stage starts on the 23rd day, and the epithelium with a fully developed keratinized layer resembles that of the epithelium in adult animals. No periderm was observed on the epithelial surface. It was confirmed that at the time of hatching the parakeratinized epithelium is fully differentiated and ready to fulfill its function during food transport. The presence of periderm is a common feature characteristic for para- and orthokeratinized epithelium in the oral cavity of birds. However, the formation of the keratinized/cornified layer is different for these two types of keratinized epithelia.
162	30381731	Identification of duck liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and characterization of its bactericidal activity.	Hong Y, Truong AD, Lee J, Lee K, Kim GB, Heo KN, Lillehoj HS, Hong YH	Asian-Australas J Anim Sci	 2019 Jul;32(7):1052-1061	 doi: 105713/ajas180571 Epub 2018 Oct 29	OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to identify duck liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) and demonstrate its antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 6 to 8-week-old Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized. To confirm the duck LEAP-2 transcript expression levels, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted. Two kinds of peptides (a linear peptide and a disulfide-type peptide) were synthesized to compare the antimicrobial activity. Then, antimicrobial activity assay and fluorescence microscopic analysis were conducted to demonstrate duck LEAP-2 bactericidal activity. RESULTS: The duck LEAP-2 peptide sequence showed high identity with those of other avian species (>85%), as well as more than 55% of identity with mammalian sequences. LEAP-2 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver with duodenum next, and then followed by lung, spleen, bursa and jejunum and was the lowest in the muscle. Both of LEAP-2 peptides efficiently killed bacteria, although the disulfide-type LEAP-2 showed more powerful bactericidal activity. Also, gram-positive bacteria was more susceptible to duck LEAP-2 than gram-negative bacteria. Using microscopy, we confirmed that LEAP-2 peptides could kill bacteria by disrupting the bacterial cell envelope. CONCLUSION: Duck LEAP-2 showed its antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Disulfide bonds were important for the powerful killing effect by disrupting the bacterial cell envelope. Therefore, duck LEAP-2 can be used for effective antibiotics alternatives.
163	30373662	Alternate routes of influenza A virus infection in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wille M, Brojer C, Lundkvist A, Jarhult JD	Vet Res	 2018 Oct 29;49(1):110	 doi: 101186/s13567-018-0604-0	The natural reservoir for all influenza A viruses (IAVs) is wild birds, particularly dabbling ducks. During the autumn, viral prevalence can be very high in dabbling ducks (> 30%) in the Northern Hemisphere, and individuals may be repeatedly infected. Transmission and infection is through the fecal-oral route, whereby birds shed viruses in feces and conspecifics are infected though feeding in virus-contaminated water. In this study we wanted to assess two alternative infection routes: cloacal drinking and preening. Using experimental infections, we assessed patterns of infection using a combination of virus shedding, as assessed by real-time PCR from cloacal swabs, and patterns of viral replication using virus-immunohistochemistry of gastrointestinal tissues. The cloacal drinking experiment consisted of two trials using cloacal inoculation at two different time points to account for age differences, as well as a trial whereby ducks were allowed to take up virus-laden water through the cloaca. All ducks became infected, and rather than the bursa of Fabricius being the main site of replication, the colon had the highest intensity of replication, as inferred through immunohistochemistry. In experiments assessing preening, feathers were contaminated with virus-laden water and all ducks became infected, regardless of whether they were kept individually or together. Further, naive contacts were infected by the individuals whose feathers were virus-contaminated. Overall, we reinforce that IAV transmission in dabbling ducks is multifactorial-if exposed to virus-contaminated water ducks may be infected through dabbling, preening of infected feathers, and cloacal drinking.
164	32175449	Effect of stocking density on behavioral traits, blood biochemical parameters and immune responses in meat ducks exposed to heat stress.	Park BS, Um KH, Park SO, Zammit VA	Arch Anim Breed	 2018 Oct 30;61(4):425-432	 doi: 105194/aab-61-425-2018 eCollection 2018	High stocking density (HSD) and heat stress (HS) caused by climate change can lower blood homeostasis and negatively impact the behavioral traits of animals. The objective of this study was to explore the influence of stocking densities on behavioral traits, blood parameters, immune responses, and stress hormones in meat ducks (Cherry valley, Anas platyrhynchos) exposed to HS. A total of 320 meat ducks were assigned to four groups with different stocking densities using a randomized complete block design. The ducks were then reared for 42 days. The assigned density groups were as follows: (1) control group (CON, three birdsm - 2 , normal environmental heat conditions); (2) low stocking density (LSD, three birdsm - 2 , heat stress conditions); (3) medium stocking density (MSD, four birdsm - 2 , heat stress conditions); and (4) high stocking density (HSD, six birdsm - 2 , heat stress conditions). To induce HS, the environment of the poultry house was set to a temperature of 34 +/- 2 composite function C with a relative humidity of 70% from 11:00 to 16:00 for the finisher period (from day 22 to day 42 of the rearing period). Concentrations of blood triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were higher in the HS groups compared with the CON group, with HSD showing the highest levels ( P < 0.05 ). The concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and glucose were lower in the HSD groups than in the CON group ( P < 0.05 ). Red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) counts were lower in HS groups compared with the CON group, with the HSD group displaying the lowest counts ( P < 0.05 ). Blood pH values were also higher in the HS groups than in the CON group, with the highest values observed in the HSD group ( P < 0.05 ). Concentrations of blood p CO 2 , HCO 3 , and T CO 2 were higher in the HS groups than in the CON group, with HSD showing the lowest levels ( P < 0.05 ). The concentration of PO 2 was higher in CON than in any of the HS groups, with the lowest levels found in the HSD group ( P < 0.05 ). The concentrations of blood IgG and corticosterone were increased in the HS groups compared with the CON group ( P < 0.05 ). Animal behavioral trait scores were also higher in HS groups than in the CON group ( P < 0.05 ); these scores were the highest in the HSD group. Overall, animal behavioral traits, blood biochemical parameters, and immune responses in meat ducks exposed to heat stress were highest in the HSD group, but not significantly different between the LSD or MSD groups.
165	30349536	Characterization and Roles of Cherry Valley Duck NLRP3 in Innate Immunity During Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli Infection.	Li R, Lin J, Hou X, Han S, Weng H, Xu T, Li N, Chai T, Wei L	Front Immunol	 2018 Oct 8;9:2300	 doi: 103389/fimmu201802300 eCollection 2018	The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is a pattern recognition receptor that is involved in host innate immunity and located in the cytoplasm. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of Cherry Valley duck NLRP3 (duNLRP3) (2,805 bp encode 935 amino acids) was firstly cloned from the spleen of healthy Cherry Valley ducks, and the phylogenetic tree indicated that the duNLRP3 has the closest relationship with Anas platyrhynchos in the bird branch. According to quantitative real-time PCR analysis, the duNLRP3 mRNA has a broad expression spectrum in healthy Cherry Valley duck tissues, and the highest expression is in the pancreas. There was significant up-regulation of duNLRP3 mRNA expression in the liver and down-regulation in the spleen after infection with avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) O1K1, especially at 3 days after the infection. Ducks hatched from NLRP3-lentiviral vector-injected eggs had significantly higher duNLRP3 mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, brain, and cecum, which are tissues usually with lower background expression. The mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha significantly increased after the APEC infection in those tissues. The bacterial content in the liver and spleen decreased significantly compared with the NC-lentiviral vector-injected ducks. In addition, in the duck embryo fibroblasts, both of the overexpression and knockdown of duNLRP3 can trigger the innate immune response during the E. coli infection. Specifically, overexpression induced antibacterial activation, and knockdown reduced the antibacterial activity of the host cells. The IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha mRNA expressions showed up-regulation or down-regulation. The results demonstrate that duNLRP3 has a certain antibacterial activity during E. coli infection. These findings also contribute to better understanding the importance of duNLRP3 in regulating the inflammatory response and the innate immune system of ducks.
166	30337766	The roles of migratory and resident birds in local avian influenza infection dynamics.	Lisovski S, van Dijk JGB, Klinkenberg D, Nolet BA, Fouchier RAM, Klaassen M	J Appl Ecol	 2018 Nov;55(6):2963-2975	 doi: 101111/1365-266413154 Epub 2018 Mar 26	Migratory birds are an increasing focus of interest when it comes to infection dynamics and the spread of avian influenza viruses (AIV). However, we lack detailed understanding migratory birds' contribution to local AIV prevalence levels and their downstream socio-economic costs and threats.To explain the potential differential roles of migratory and resident birds in local AIV infection dynamics, we used a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. We investigated five (mutually non- exclusive) mechanisms potentially driving observed prevalence patterns: 1) a pronounced birth pulse (e.g. the synchronised annual influx of immunologically naive individuals), 2) short-term immunity, 3) increase of susceptible migrants, 4) differential susceptibility to infection (i.e. transmission rate) for migrants and residents, and 5) replacement of migrants during peak migration.SIR models describing all possible combinations of the five mechanisms were fitted to individual AIV infection data from a detailed longitudinal surveillance study in the partially migratory mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). During autumn and winter, the local resident mallard community also held migratory mallards that exhibited distinct AIV infection dynamics.Replacement of migratory birds during peak migration in autumn was found to be the most important mechanism driving the variation in local AIV infection patterns. This suggests that a constant influx of migratory birds, likely immunological naive to locally circulating AIV strains, is required to predict the observed temporal prevalence patterns and the distinct differences in prevalence between residents and migrants.Synthesis and applications. Our analysis reveals a key mechanism that could explain the amplifying role of migratory birds in local avian influenza virus infection dynamics; the constant flow and replacement of migratory birds during peak migration. Aside from monitoring efforts, in order to achieve adequate disease management and control in wildlife - with knock-on effects for livestock and humans, - we conclude that it is crucial, in future surveillance studies, to record host demographical parameters such as population density, timing of birth and turnover of migrants.
167	30311520	Successful chemical ablation of an intraorbital cyst caused by an eyelid injury and iatrogenic ankyloblepharon formation in a duck.	Park SA, Davidson H, Thompson KA, Smith RP, Noland E, Sledge D, Thomas JS, Komaromy AM	J Am Vet Med Assoc	 2018 Nov 1;253(9):1164-1168	 doi: 102460/javma25391164	CASE DESCRIPTION A client-owned 2-year-old 1.8-kg (4-lb) male pet Rouen duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) was evaluated because of severe swelling around the left eye following traumatic injury to the upper and lower eyelids and 2 associated surgeries that resulted in the removal of the entire upper and lower eyelid margins. CLINICAL FINDINGS At initial evaluation, ankyloblepharon of the left eye was observed, with no upper or lower eyelid margins and a large, round, fluctuant subcutaneous mass over the left orbit. Orbital exploration and histologic examination revealed a benign cyst consisting of fibrous tissue, conjunctiva, and skeletal muscle bundles. Bacterial culture of cystic fluid yielded few Staphylococcus delphini. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Excision of the cyst and evisceration of the left globe were performed, and once daily treatment with orally administered enrofloxacin suspension (12.6 mg/kg [5.7 mg/lb]) and meloxicam (1 mg/kg [0.45 mg/lb]) was initiated. Over the next 4 days, the cyst redeveloped and progressively enlarged. Accumulated fluid was aspirated from the cyst, and 20 mg of gentamicin was injected intraorbitally with ultrasound guidance. Over the subsequent 27-month period, no recurrence of clinical signs or adverse effects were reported by the owner. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of cyst formation after adnexal injury and evisceration in birds and its successful treatment with intralesional gentamicin injection. Findings emphasized the importance of preserving lacrimal puncta during adnexal or eye removal surgeries in birds. Intralesional injection of gentamicin with the goal of destroying fluid-producing cells may be a safe and effective way to treat intraorbital cysts in birds and other species, although additional research would be required to confirm this.
168	30305481	A new DNA marker of the TMIGD1 gene used to identify high fertilization rates in Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Huang HL, Liu HL, Cheng YS	J Reprod Dev	 2018 Dec 14;64(6):529-534	 doi: 101262/jrd2018-071 Epub 2018 Oct 10	In a prior study, comparisons of individuals of Anas platyrhynchos with higher/lower reproductive performances showed that the expression of the transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain containing 1 (TMIGD1) gene significantly differed between the two groups. Here, we demonstrate that ducks with the TMIGD1 GG genotype have a significantly higher fertilization rate than other TMIGD1 genotypes. Primers designed based on the TMIGD1 sequence of Pekin duck were able to successfully amplify a TMIGD1 fragment from Tsaiya ducks, and sequencing results indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TMIGD1 gene existed. We also developed a cost-effective method of restriction fragment length polymorphism. Using the above methods, ducks were classified into three genotypes. To identify the relationships between genotypes and traits, we recorded the ducks' performance; to ensure the coverage of the entire duration of the fertile period, the egg collection period was extended to 18 days, and therefore, lower than usual fertilization rates were observed. Further assessment using a high-throughput system showed that the ducks with the GG genotype exhibited the highest fertilization rates among genotypes (P < 0.05). We suggest that TMIGD1 may affect the release of sperm protection factors from the female genital tract, and thus alter fertilization rate. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the TMIGD1 GG genotype can be used as a new DNA marker to identify animals with high fertilization rates at a young age, a process which could improve farming efficiency.
169	30300504	Biochemical characterization of the minimal domains of an iterative eukaryotic polyketide synthase.	Sabatini M, Comba S, Altabe S, Recio-Balsells AI, Labadie GR, Takano E, Gramajo H, Arabolaza A	FEBS J	 2018 Dec;285(23):4494-4511	 doi: 101111/febs14675 Epub 2018 Oct 25	Iterative type I polyketide synthases (PKS) are megaenzymes essential to the biosynthesis of an enormously diverse array of bioactive natural products. Each PKS contains minimally three functional domains, beta-ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP), and a subset of reducing domains such as ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoylreductase (ER). The substrate selection, condensation reactions, and beta-keto processing of the polyketide growing chain are highly controlled in a programmed manner. However, the structural features and mechanistic rules that orchestrate the iterative cycles, processing domains functionality, and chain termination in this kind of megaenzymes are often poorly understood. Here, we present a biochemical and functional characterization of the KS and the AT domains of a PKS from the mallard duck Anas platyrhynchos (ApPKS). ApPKS belongs to an animal PKS family phylogenetically more related to bacterial PKS than to metazoan fatty acid synthases. Through the dissection of the ApPKS enzyme into mono- to didomain fragments and its reconstitution in vitro, we determined its substrate specificity toward different starters and extender units. ApPKS AT domain can effectively transfer acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to the ApPKS ACP stand-alone domain. Furthermore, the KS and KR domains, in the presence of Escherichia coli ACP, acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA, showed the ability to catalyze the chain elongation and the beta-keto reduction steps necessary to yield a 3-hydroxybutyryl-ACP derivate. These results provide new insights into the catalytic efficiency and specificity of this uncharacterized family of PKSs.
170	30291502	Evidence of avian poxvirus and papillomavirus infection in Gyps fulvus in Italy.	Di Francesco CE, Profeta F, Romanucci M, Zuccarini R, Altea T, Malatesta D, Della Salda L, Marsilio F	Arch Virol	 2019 Jan;164(1):291-295	 doi: 101007/s00705-018-4055-8 Epub 2018 Oct 5	The identification of avian poxvirus and avian papillomavirus associated with cutaneous lesions in griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) by histopathology, electron microscopy and PCR analysis is reported. Sequence analysis of the fpv140 gene revealed 99% identity to two poxviruses obtained from a white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and a common buzzard (Buteo buteo). Partial sequence of the papillomavirus L1 gene showed sequence similarity to papillomavirus LI genes from African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) (69% identity), duck (Anas platyrhynchos) (68% identity), and yellow-necked francolin (Francolinus leucoscepus) (66% identity). To date, this is the first identification of avian poxvirus and papillomavirus in griffon vultures and the first evidence of infection of both viruses in live wild birds.
171	30219949	Avifauna conservation and disturbance ecology in a coastal freshwater lagoon.	Cruz T, Lima J, Luis A, Azeiteiro UM	Environ Monit Assess	 2018 Sep 15;190(10):592	 doi: 101007/s10661-018-6967-x	This work was developed in Barrinha de Mira Coastal Lagoon, Portugal. The lagoon belongs to the Natura 2000 network. Its main objectives were to monitor aquatic bird species before, during, and after a desorption intervention on this lagoon. Monitoring of waterfowl was carried out to evaluate the monthly variation of birds in Barrinha, in order to obtain useful information for region's management and planning, as well as for species preservation. In experimental design, it was decided to perform four counts per month in each pond (weekly), to evaluate the effect of increased monitoring effort in relation to previous years. The results revealed that the study area has a significant importance as a wintering zone for water birds. Some species have stable resident populations which, seasonally, see their numbers vary with migratory birds arrival and departure. Another purpose was to verify the influence of desorption intervention on the usual number of individuals by species. The results show that during and after intervention, there was a reduction of birds in the order of 89%, being more visible in the populations of Anas platyrhynchos and Fulica atra.
172	30187087	Polymorphism of duck MHC class molecules.	Zhang L, Lin D, Yu S, Bai J, Jiang W, Su W, Huang Y, Yang S, Wu J	Immunogenetics	 2019 Jan;71(1):49-59	 doi: 101007/s00251-018-1076-0 Epub 2018 Sep 5	Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules are critically involved in defense against pathogens, and their high polymorphism is advantageous to a range of immune responses, especially in duck displaying biased expression of one MHC I gene. Here, we examined MHC I polymorphism in two duck (Anas platyrhynchos) breeds from China: Shaoxing (SX) and Jinding (JD). Twenty-seven unique UAA alleles identified from the MHC I genes of these breeds were analyzed concerning amino acid composition, homology, and phylogenetic relationships. Based on amino acid sequence homology, allelic groups of Anas platyrhynchos MHC I (Anpl-MHC I) were established and their distribution was analyzed. Then, highly variable sites (HVSs) in peptide-binding domains (PBD) were estimated and located in the three-dimensional structure of Anpl-MHC I. The UAA alleles identified showed high polymorphism, based on full-length sequence homology. By adding the alleles found here to known Anpl-MHC I genes from domestic ducks, they could be divided into 17 groups and four novel groups were revealed for SX and JD ducks. The UAA alleles of the two breeds were not divergent from the MHC I of other duck breeds, and HVSs were mostly located in the peptide-binding groove (PBG), suggesting that they might determine peptide-binding characteristics and subsequently influence peptide presentation and recognition. The results from the present study enrich Anpl-MHC I polymorphism data and clarify the distribution of alleles with different peptide-binding specificities, which might also accelerate effective vaccine development and help control various infections in ducks.
173	30173341	Reinvestigation of the sperm ultrastructure of Hypoderaeum conoideum (Digenea: Echinostomatidae).	Miquel J, Martellet MR, Acosta L, Toledo R, Petavy AF	Parasitol Res	 2018 Dec;117(12):3725-3732	 doi: 101007/s00436-018-6071-8 Epub 2018 Sep 1	Spermatological characteristics of the digenean Hypoderaeum conoideum (Echinostomatidae) collected from Anas platyrhynchos in the Lac d'Annecy (France) were reinvestigated using transmission electron microscopy. The previous study on this species only describes the presence of two axonemes of unequal lengths, a mitochondrion, a posterior nucleus, and the disposition of cortical microtubules. The present ultrastructural study reveals that the mature spermatozoon of H. conoideum is a filiform cell tapered at both extremities. The sperm cell exhibits the characteristics of a digenean spermatozoa type V, namely two axonemes of the 9 + '1' pattern of trepaxonematan Platyhelminthes, external ornamentation of the plasma membrane associated with cortical microtubules, and located in the anterior part of the proximal region of the sperm cell, lateral expansions, two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules, maximum number of cortical microtubules in the anterior part of the spermatozoon, and presence of two mitochondria. In addition, the sperm cell of H. conoideum shows spine-like bodies and a posterior extremity with only the nucleus. The ultrastructural characters of the spermatozoon of H. conoideum are compared with those of other digeneans belonging to the superfamily Echinostomatoidea.
174	30159217	Cytotoxicity and Antiangiogenic Activity of Turbinaria ornata Agardh and Padina australis Hauck Ethanolic Extracts.	Canoy JL, Bitacura JG	Anal Cell Pathol (Amst)	 2018 Aug 6;2018:3709491	 doi: 101155/2018/3709491 eCollection 2018	Brown macroalgae species are constantly reported as potential sources of bioactive compounds useful in inhibiting cell proliferation and vascular formation. Thus, this study was conducted to determine and compare the in vitro cytotoxic activities of Turbinaria ornata Agardh and Padina australis Hauck ethanolic extracts against baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using the resazurin reduction test (RRT) and investigate their in vivo antiangiogenic activity through duck (Anas platyrhynchos) chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Both T. ornata and P. australis ethanolic extracts exhibited cytotoxic activities at IC50 of 530.53 ppm and 528.78 ppm, respectively, and significant cytotoxicity was determined in 750 ppm and 1000 ppm concentrations of T. ornata and 1000 ppm concentration of P. australis. Also, both T. ornata and P. australis ethanolic extracts exhibited antiangiogenic activity (100% vascular inhibition) as all the concentrations of both species caused severe vascular damage in all the duck CAM samples treated. These results show the potential future application of these species for cytotoxic activities and vascular inhibition. The conduct of further tests using other model systems is recommended.
175	30151242	Where do all the subtypes go- Temporal dynamics of H8-H12 influenza A viruses in waterfowl.	Wille M, Latorre-Margalef N, Tolf C, Halpin R, Wentworth D, Fouchier RAM, Raghwani J, Pybus OG, Olsen B, Waldenstrom J	Virus Evol	 2018 Aug 14;4(2):vey025	 doi: 101093/ve/vey025 eCollection 2018 Jul	Influenza A virus (IAV) is ubiquitous in waterfowl. In the northern hemisphere IAV prevalence is highest during the autumn and coincides with a peak in viral subtype diversity. Although haemagglutinin subtypes H1-H12 are associated with waterfowl hosts, subtypes H8-H12 are detected very infrequently. To better understand the role of waterfowl in the maintenance of these rare subtypes, we sequenced H8-H12 viruses isolated from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from 2002 to 2009. These rare viruses exhibited varying ecological and phylodynamic features. The Eurasian clades of H8 and H12 phylogenies were dominated by waterfowl sequences; mostly viruses sequenced in this study. H11, once believed to be a subtype that infected charadriiformes (shorebirds), exhibited patterns more typical of common virus subtypes. Finally, subtypes H9 and H10, which have maintained lineages in poultry, showed markedly different patterns: H10 was associated with all possible NA subtypes and this drove HA lineage diversity within years. Rare viruses belonging to subtypes H8-H12 were highly reassorted, indicating that these rare subtypes are part of the broader IAV pool. Our results suggest that waterfowl play a role in the maintenance of these rare subtypes, but we recommend additional sampling of non-traditional hosts to better understand the reservoirs of these rare viruses.
176	30134879	Crystal structure of duck egg lysozyme isoform II (DEL-II).	Langley DB, Christ D	BMC Struct Biol	 2018 Aug 22;18(1):10	 doi: 101186/s12900-018-0090-7	BACKGROUND: Lysozyme purified from duck eggs (DEL) has long been used as a model antigen as a counterpoint to the enzyme purified from hen eggs (HEL). However, unlike the single C-type variant found in hen eggs, duck eggs contain multiple isoforms: I, II and III. We recently reported the structures of isoforms I and III from Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and unequivocally determined the sequences of all three isoforms by mass spectrometry. Here we present the crystal structure of isoform II (DEL-II). RESULTS: Lysozyme isoform II was purified from isoforms I and III using ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography, then crystallized. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.15 A resolution and the structure of DEL-II was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of DEL-I as the search model. It contains two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit: both molecules display a canonical C-type lysozyme fold and electron density consistent with the expected sequence. The most significant difference between the two molecules concerns different conformations of a surface loop containing one of the expected amino acid differences between the isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: The structure of DEL-II supports the primary sequence as elucidated by a combination of amino acid sequencing, DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry, with strong electron density confirming it to be an S37G G71R variant of DEL I, and differing from hen egg lysozyme at a total of 21 amino acid positions.
177	30128612	Persistence of maternal antibodies to influenza A virus among captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Dirsmith KL, Jeffrey Root J, Bentler KT, Sullivan HJ, Liebowitz AB, Petersen LH, McLean HE, Shriner SA	Arch Virol	 2018 Dec;163(12):3235-3242	 doi: 101007/s00705-018-3978-4 Epub 2018 Aug 21	Wild waterfowl are maintenance hosts of most influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes and are often the subjects of IAV surveillance and transmission models. While maternal antibodies have been detected in yolks and in nestlings for a variety of wild bird species and pathogens, the persistence of maternal antibodies to IAVs in mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) has not been previously investigated. Nonetheless, this information is important for a full understanding of IAV transmission dynamics because ducklings protected by maternal antibodies may not be susceptible to infection. In this study, we examined the transfer of IAV-specific maternal antibodies to ducklings. Blood samples were collected approximately every five days from ducklings hatched from hens previously infected with an H6 strain of IAV. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to IAV by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median persistence of maternal antibodies in ducklings was 12.5 days (range: 4-33 days) post-hatch. The majority of ducklings (71%) had detectable maternal antibodies from 4 to 17 days post-hatch, while a small subset of individuals (29%) had detectable maternal antibodies for up to 21-33 days post-hatch. Antibody concentrations in hens near the time of egg laying were correlated with maternal antibody concentrations in the initial blood sample collected from ducklings (0-4 days post-hatch). Knowledge of the duration of maternal antibodies in ducklings will aid in the interpretation of IAV serological surveillance results and in the modeling of IAV transmission dynamics in waterfowl.
178	30118893	Type C/D botulism in the waterfowl in an urban park in Italy.	Badagliacca P, Pomilio F, Auricchio B, Sperandii AF, Di Provvido A, Di Ventura M, Migliorati G, Caudullo M, Morelli D, Anniballi F	Anaerobe	 2018 Dec;54:72-74	 doi: 101016/janaerobe201807010 Epub 2018 Aug 16	This report describes an outbreak of botulism occurred among a free-living population of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese (Anser anser) in an urban park. Mortality rate among investigated population was 86,8% (118 dead out of 136). Twenty-seven carcasses were collected for macroscopic examination and screened for microbiological, virological, toxicological investigations. A sick mallard was captured and neurological symptoms were observed. No causative agent of viral avian diseases was found in the examined animals and screening for environmental neurotoxic substances proved negative as well. In contrast, microbiological cultures from specimens tested positive for botulinum toxin-producing clostridia. Blood serum and fecal extract of the sick mallard proved positive for botulinum neurotoxin in the standard mouse protection test using reference Clostridium botulinum type C antitoxin. Gene content of cultured strains showed a mosaic composition of bont/C and bont/D sequences, defining them as type C/D chimeric organisms.
179	30053696	Molecular detection of Toxoplasma gondii in feathered game intended for human consumption in the Czech Republic.	Skorpikova L, Reslova N, Lorencova A, Plhal R, Drimaj J, Kamler J, Slany M	Int J Food Microbiol	 2018 Dec 2;286:75-79	 doi: 101016/jijfoodmicro201807019 Epub 2018 Jul 21	Toxoplasma gondii is an important ubiquitous protozoan parasite, which can infect almost all warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans. The diagnosis of T. gondii infection is crucial for the prevention, surveillance, and control of its transmission. Here, a triplex real-time PCR assay targeting the B1 gene and 529rep element was used to determine the presence of T. gondii in feathered game (Anas platyrhynchos and Phasianus colchicus) hunted in the Czech Republic. The prevalence of T. gondii was 5.4% in wild ducks (n=280) and 3.4% in common pheasants (n=350). Additionally, genotyping of 28 T. gondii-positive samples revealed the presence of archetypal genotypes II and III as well as non-archetypal genotypes combining both type II and III alleles. Our results suggest that consumption of feathered game could pose a risk of T. gondii transmission to humans in the Czech Republic.
180	30043488	Long-term carriage and rapid transmission of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli within a flock of Mallards in the absence of antibiotic selection.	Sandegren L, Stedt J, Lustig U, Bonnedahl J, Andersson DI, Jarhult JD	Environ Microbiol Rep	 2018 Oct;10(5):576-582	 doi: 101111/1758-222912681 Epub 2018 Sep 18	Wild birds have been suggested as transmitters and reservoirs for antibiotic resistant bacteria. We performed an experimental study investigating carriage time and interindividual transmission of extended spectrum beta-lactamase- (ESBL-)producing Escherichia coli in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to assess if the birds carry the bacteria long enough to transfer them geographically during migration. Mallards were inoculated intraoesophageally with four different strains of ESBL-producing E. coli and kept together in a flock. The ESBL-strains belonged to sequence types previously shown to spread between birds and humans. Culturing from faecal samples showed presence of ESBL-producing E. coli the entire 29 day experimental period. An extensive and rapid transmission of the different ESBL-strains between individuals (including non-inoculated controls) was observed. In necropsy samples, we detected ESBL-strains in the cecum even in faeces-negative birds, indicating that this part of the intestine could function as a reservoir of resistant bacteria. We demonstrate that birds can carry ESBL-producing E. coli for long enough times to travel far during migration and the extensive interindividual transmission suggests spread between individuals in a dense bird population as a mechanism that allow persistence of resistant bacteria.
181	30038859	Waterbird counts on large water bodies: comparing ground and aerial methods during different ice conditions.	Marchowski D, Jankowiak L, Lawicki L, Wysocki D	PeerJ	 2018 Jul 17;6:e5195	 doi: 107717/peerj5195 eCollection 2018	The aerial and ground methods of counting birds in a coastal area during different ice conditions were compared. Ice coverage of water was an important factor affecting the results of the two methods. When the water was ice-free, more birds were counted from the ground, whereas during ice conditions, higher numbers were obtained from the air. The first group of waterbirds with the smallest difference between the two methods (average 6%) contained seven species: Mute Swan Cygnus olor, Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus, Greater Scaup Aythya marila, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula, Smew Mergellus albellus and Goosander Mergus merganser; these were treated as the core group. The second group with a moderate difference (average 20%) included another six species: Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian Wigeon Mareca penelope, Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra. The third group with a large difference (average 85%) included five species, all of the Anatini tribe: Gadwall Mareca strepera, Northern Pintail Anas acuta, Northern Shoveler Spatula clypeata, Eurasian Teal Anas crecca and Garganey Spatula querquedula. During ice conditions, smaller numbers of most species were counted from the ground. The exception here was Mallard, more of which were counted from the ground, but the difference between two methods was relatively small in this species (7.5%). Under ice-free conditions, both methods can be used interchangeably for the most numerous birds occupying open water (core group) without any significant impact on the results. When water areas are frozen over, air counts are preferable as the results are more reliable. The cost analysis shows that a survey carried out by volunteer observers (reimbursement of travel expenses only) from the land is 58% cheaper, but if the observers are paid, then an aerial survey is 40% more economical.
182	29981515	Chronic lead intoxication decreases intestinal helminth species richness and infection intensity in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Pruter H, Franz M, Auls S, Czirjak GA, Greben O, Greenwood AD, Lisitsyna O, Syrota Y, Sitko J, Krone O	Sci Total Environ	 2018 Dec 10;644:151-160	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv201806297 Epub 2018 Jul 4	Lead (Pb) pollution of aquatic habitats is a known threat to vertebrate health. Depending on Pb dosage, resulting symptoms can be chronic (sublethal) or acute (lethal). While acute exposure results in death of the animal, chronic sublethal exposure can also have consequences, reproduction, antioxidant defense and immunity being the most affected traits. While a great deal is known about Pb intoxication on avian health, relatively little is known about how intoxication impacts parasites dependent on their avian hosts. The effect of Pb on intestinal helminth species richness and infection intensity was investigated in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos, n=100) from German waters. Coracoid bones were used to measure chronic Pb exposure. Intestinal helminths were characterized morphologically. Molecular approaches were also applied to identify poorly morphologically preserved parasites to obtain sequence data (cox1 gene) for species identification and future parasitological studies. Parasite species richness and infection intensity was found to be significantly lower in birds with higher chronic Pb levels suggesting both host and parasites respond to Pb exposure. Altered immune modulation in the avian host may be the underlying mechanisms of Pb triggered decrease of parasites. However, it also likely reflects differences in the susceptibility of different helminths to Pb. Cestode and acanthocephala species richness were particularly impacted by Pb exposure. We conclude that, Pb intoxication may both negatively impact avian host and parasite diversity in aquatic habitats.
183	29971756	The novel histological evidence of the blood-spleen barrier in duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Sun X, Liu E, Wang T, Zhang Q, Yang P, Ahmed N, Zhao Q, Chen Q	Histol Histopathol	 2019 Jan;34(1):33-45	 doi: 1014670/HH-18-019 Epub 2018 Jul 4	To identify the existence and composition of the blood-spleen barrier (BSB) in ducks, the microanatomical structures of the duck spleen were investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy, silver staining, enzymatic histochemistry and intravenous injection of ink. The endothelial cells of the sheathed capillaries were cuboidal-shaped and surrounded by an ellipsoid consisting of reticular cells, similar to high endothelial venules (HEVs). After ink injection, carbon particles were initially restricted to the ellipsoid and later trapped in the periellipsoidal lymphatic sheaths (PELS), and then transferred to the periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths (PALS) and splenic nodules over time. Reticular fibers were primarily distributed at the basement membrane of the sheathed capillaries and the periphery of the PELS. Macrophages were primarily distributed at the border between red pulp and PELS. These results suggested that the BSB was present in the ellipsoid and PELS and consisted of the mechanical barrier composed of endothelial cells of the sheathed capillaries, reticular cells and reticular fibers and the biological barrier composed of ellipsoid-associated macrophages. In conclusion, the BSB was identified in the duck spleen for the first time, including cuboidal endothelial cells, ellipsoid-associated macrophages, reticular cells and fibers, and resisting circulating pathogen invasions. The study of BSB in ducks provides a theoretical foundation for the structural composition of the avian immune system.

Holubova N, Sak B, Hlaskova L, Kvetonova D, Hanzal V, Rajsky D, Rost M, McEvoy J, Kvac M	Exp Parasitol	 2018 Aug;191:62-65	 doi: 101016/jexppara201806007 Epub 2018 Jun 28	Host- and age-specificity of Cryptosporidium avium were studied in 1-, 21- and 365-day-old chickens (Gallus gallus), domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) under experimental conditions. Cryptosporidium avium was not infectious for ring-necked pheasants, but it was infectious for ducks and chickens at all age categories. The course of infection in ducks did not differ among age categories, but 365-day-old chickens had less severe infections than 1- and 21-day-old chickens. The patent period in chickens and ducks was >30 DPI, but ducks started to shed oocysts of C. avium earlier (5-6 DPI) and at a lower intensity (accumulated value of infection intensity of 58,000-65,000 OPG) than chickens (9-11 DPI and accumulated value of infection intensity of 100,000-105,000 OPG). Experimentally infected birds showed no clinical signs of cryptosporidiosis.

Sirsat TS, Crossley DA 2nd, Crossley JL, Dzialowski EM	J Comp Physiol B	 2018 Sep;188(5):843-853	 doi: 101007/s00360-018-1166-1 Epub 2018 Jun 8	Thyroid hormones are key regulators of avian metabolism and may play a significant role in development at hatching. To better understand the role of thyroid hormones in avian development, we examined autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure while manipulating thyroid hormone levels in the late stage embryonic Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). Thyroid hormone levels were manipulated on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period with the thyroperoxidase inhibitor methimazole (MMI), triiodothyronine (T3), or saline. On day 25 of incubation, autonomic tone on cardiovascular function was studied by injections of cholinergic and adrenergic receptor antagonists. Embryos from all treatment groups expressed a cholinergic and beta-adrenergic tone on heart rate at this age. Cholinergic blockade with atropine produced a larger change in heart rate in the hyperthyroid animals compared with euthyroid animals. In response to beta-adrenergic blockade, hyperthyroid conditions produced a larger decrease in heart rate compared with euthyroid animals, with no change in mean arterial blood pressure. In response to alpha-adrenergic blockade, mean arterial blood pressure decreased in the euthyroid animals and more developed hyperthyroid animals. Collectively, the data indicate that elevated levels of T3 can influence maturation of cholinergic and adrenergic receptor-mediated cardiovascular regulation in developing Pekin ducks near the end of incubation.
186	29945164	A new method for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in a female reproduction-associated gene, tmigd1, of Anas platyrhynchos using a strip biosensor with gold nanoparticles.	Lin CW, Kuo JC, Liu HL, Cheng YS, Huang HL	Poult Sci	 2018 Oct 1;97(10):3456-3462	 doi: 103382/ps/pey240	In this study, we first reported a lateral flow assay combined with primer extension (PEXT) and gold nanoparticles for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the tmigd1 gene of the Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), which has the advantages of simplicity of operation, cost-effectiveness, and time-saving. Gold nanoparticles were tailed with thiol-thymine oligodeoxyribonucleotides (thiol-(dT)30) using the salt-aging method at 25 degrees C and used as a label in a lateral flow assay. The lateral flow device was composed of test and control zones on a nitrocellulose membrane containing streptavidin and adenosine oligodeoxyribonucleotides ((dA)30), respectively. When the specific SNP existed, the corresponding primers were extended, and the reaction product was captured by streptavidin at the test zone owing to the introduction of biotin-deoxyuridine triphosphate (biotin-dUTP) into the reaction product during PEXT. Gold nanoparticles hybridized with the reaction product to render it visible. Here, we developed a new system for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in a female reproduction-associated gene, tmigd1, of Anas platyrhynchos using the strip biosensor, and identified the optimized parameters for the concentration of Mg2+ in the PEXT reaction and the amount of streptavidin used on membranes for signal specificity.

Helin AS, Wille M, Atterby C, Jarhult J, Waldenstrom J, Chapman JR	Data Brief	 2018 Apr 23;18:1562-1566	 doi: 101016/jdib201804061 eCollection 2018 Jun	This article provides data on primer sequences used to amplify the innate immune genes RIG-I and Mx and a set of normalizing reference genes in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and shows which reference genes are stable, per tissue, for our experimental settings. Data on the expressional changes of these two genes over a time-course of infection with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI) are provided. Individual-level data are also presented, including LPAI infection load, and per tissue gene expression of RIG-I and Mx. Gene expression in two outlier individuals is explored in more depth.
188	29894211	Prevalence of Multiple Subtypes of Avian Influenza Virus Antibodies in Egg Yolks of Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos) and White-winged Terns ( Chlidonias leucopterus) in the Northeastern Republic of China.	Chen X, Qi Y, Wang H, Wang Y, Wang H, Ni H	J Wildl Dis	 2018 Oct;54(4):834-837	 doi: 107589/2017-10-253 Epub 2018 Jun 12	Wild birds are natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (AIV) and can transmit viruses to poultry and other species. To monitor the prevalence of AIV antibodies, 211 eggs from wild Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos) and 177 from wild White-winged Terns ( Chlidonias leucopterus) were collected from Zhalong Wetland and Xianghai Wetland in northeastern Republic of China from April to September, 2016. A hemagglutinin inhibition test detected the presence of H1, H3, H5, and H7 subtype-specific antibodies. The prevalences of AIV antibodies of subtypes H1 and H3 were relatively high while the prevalences of H5 and H7 AIV subtype antibody were low. In Zhalong Wetland, the prevalence of H1 AIV subtype antibody in Mallards was the highest, with a percentage of 11.0%. Prevalence of all AIV subtype-specific antibodies in Mallards was higher than those in White-winged Terns.
189	29844967	Endozoochory by mallard in New Zealand: what seeds are dispersed and how far-	Bartel RD, Sheppard JL, Lovas-Kiss A, Green AJ	PeerJ	 2018 May 23;6:e4811	 doi: 107717/peerj4811 eCollection 2018	In Europe and North America waterfowl are major dispersers of aquatic and terrestrial plants, but in New Zealand their role has yet to be investigated. Mallards were introduced to New Zealand in the late 1800s, and today they are the most abundant and widespread waterfowl in the country. To assess seed dispersal, we radiomarked 284 female mallards from two study sites during the pre-breeding (June-August) and breeding (August-December) periods in 2014-2015, and examined movements that occurred within 24, 48 or 72 h when seed dispersal by endozoochory is considered likely. During June and July 2015, we collected 29 faecal samples from individual female mallards during radiomarking and 24 samples from mallard flocks. We recovered 69 intact seeds from the faecal samples and identified 12 plant taxa. Of the plant seeds identified and dispersed by mallards in this study, 40% were members of the Asteraceae family, nine plant species were alien to New Zealand, and the indigenous-status of three unidentified taxa could not be determined. Two taxa (and 9% of seeds) were germinated following gut passage: an unidentified Asteraceae and Solanum nigrum. During the pre-breeding and breeding periods, movement of females within 24 h averaged 394 m (SD = 706 m) and 222 m (SD = 605 m) respectively, with maximum distances of 3,970 m and 8,028 m. Maxima extended to 19,230 m within 48 h. Most plant species recorded are generally assumed to be self-dispersed or dispersed by water; mechanisms that provide a much lower maximum dispersal distance than mallards. The ability of mallards to disperse viable seeds up to 19 km within 48 h suggests they have an important and previously overlooked role as vectors for a variety of wetland or grassland plant species in New Zealand.

192	29771917	The differentiation of preadipocytes and gene expression related to adipogenesis in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wang S, Zhang Y, Xu Q, Yuan X, Dai W, Shen X, Wang Z, Chang G, Wang Z, Chen G	PLoS One	 2018 May 17;13(5):e0196371	 doi: 101371/journalpone0196371 eCollection 2018	Meat quality is closely related to adipose tissues in ducks, and adipogenesis is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors tightly acting at different stages of differentiation especially in ducks. The aim of this study was to establish the preadipocyte in vitro culture system and understand the biological characteristics of expansion of duck adipocyte tissue at the cellular and molecular level. We isolated pre-adipocytes from the subcutaneous fat of three breeds of duck and differentiated them into mature adipocytes using a mixture of insulin, rosiglitazone, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and oleic acid over 0,2, 4, 6, and 8 days. Successful differentiation was confirmed from the development of lipid droplets and their response to Oil Red O, and increasing numbers of lipid droplets were stained red over time. The expression of key marker genes, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), and fatty acid synthetase (FAS), gradually increased during pre-adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, it was verified by interference experiments that the knockdown of PPARgamma directly reduced lipid production. Meanwhile we analyzed the role of unsaturated fatty acids in the production of poultry fat using different concentrations of oleic acid and found that lipid droplet deposition was highest when the concentration of oleic acid was 300 muM. We also compared the level of differentiated pre-adipocytes that were isolated from Jianchang ducks (fatty-meat duck), Cherry Valley ducks (lean-meat duck) and White-crested ducks (egg-producing duck). The proliferation and differentiation rate of pre-adipocytes derived from Jianchang ducks was higher than that of White-crested ducks. These results provide the foundation for further research into waterfowl adipogenesis.
193	29742160	Characterizing early embryonic development of Brown Tsaiya Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in comparison with Taiwan Country Chicken (Gallus gallus domestics).	Lumsangkul C, Fan YK, Chang SC, Ju JC, Chiang HI	PLoS One	 2018 May 9;13(5):e0196973	 doi: 101371/journalpone0196973 eCollection 2018	Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2 degrees C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.
194	29720294	Adipogenic genes expression in relation to hepatic steatosis in the liver of two duck species.	Herault F, Duby C, Baeza E, Diot C	Animal	 2018 Dec;12(12):2571-2577	 doi: 101017/S1751731118000897 Epub 2018 May 3	Some studies have shown that expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a key regulator of adipogenesis, and of some adipocyte-specific genes or adipokines are expressed in hepatic steatosis, leading to the concept of 'adipogenic hepatic steatosis' or 'hepatic adiposis.' Most of these studies were conducted in genetic obese mouse models or after manipulation of gene expression. The relevance of this concept to other species and more physiological models was here addressed in ducks which are able to develop hepatic steatosis after overfeeding. The expression of PPARG and other adipocyte-specific genes was thus analyzed in the liver of ducks fed ad libitum or overfed and compared with those observed in adipose tissues. Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos) and Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) were analyzed, as metabolic responses to overfeeding differ according to these two species, Muscovy ducks having a greater ability to synthesize and store lipids in the liver than Pekin ducks. Our results indicate that adipocyte-specific genes are expressed in the liver of ducks, PPARG and fatty acid-binding protein 4 being upregulated and adiponectin and leptin receptor downregulated by overfeeding. However, these expression levels are much lower than those observed in adipose tissue suggesting that fatty liver cells are not transformed to adipocytes, although some hepato-specific functions are decreased in fatty liver when compared with normal liver.
195	29713751	Bioaccumulation and Distribution of Hexabromocyclododecane Isomers in Duck Tissues.	Xia W, Wang J, Yang H, Zhang H, Yang B, Zeng Y, Xu J, Li Z, Qian M	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	 2018 Jun;100(6):754-759	 doi: 101007/s00128-018-2342-4 Epub 2018 Apr 30	Eighty ducks (Sheldrake, Anas platyrhynchos) from Zhejiang Province, China were fed capsules containing commercialized hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) at low (0.8 mg/kg/day) or high (1.6 mg/kg/day) exposure level, or only maize starch for 21 days. Then the next 21 days was set as depuration period. Ducks were euthanizated at 0, 7, 14 and 21 days after last dose and ten duck tissues including skin, tongue, intestines, heart, gizzard, muscle, liver, lung, brain and blood were sampled, separately. Three HBCDs including alpha-HBCD, beta-HBCD and gamma-HBCD in duck tissue samples were analyzed. At the end of depuration period, the total HBCDs concentration in skin was significantly higher than those in the other tissues (p < 0.05). The elimination rates of the three isomers in skin, tongue, intestines, heart, gizzard and brain were in the order beta- > gamma- > alpha-HBCD. The enantioselectivity of three HBCDs enantiomers was also studied in ten duck tissues. It was shown that the EF (enrichment factor) for two gamma-HBCD enantiomers was significant lower than 0.5 (p < 0.05) in gizzard, heart, muscle, tongue, intestinal and liver at the end of depuration day, showing a selective accumulation of (+)-gamma-HBCD in these tissues. This study provided a reference for evaluation on the accumulation of the persistent contamination of HBCDs in edible poultry.
196	29707734	Genomic and biological characterization of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Habib M, Yaqub T, Nazir J, Shehzad W, Aziz-Ul-Rahman, Sohail T, Mukhtar N, Mehboob A, Munir M, Shabbir MZ	Arch Virol	 2018 Aug;163(8):2179-2188	 doi: 101007/s00705-018-3840-8 Epub 2018 Apr 30	Given the global evolutionary dynamics of Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs), it is imperative to continue extensive surveillance, routine monitoring and characterization of isolates originating from natural reservoirs (waterfowls). In this report, we isolated and characterized two virulent NDV strains from clinically healthy mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Both isolates had a genome of 15,192 nucleotides encoding six genes in an order of 3 -NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5 . The biological characteristics (mean death time: 49.5-50 hr, EID5010(8.5) ml(-1)) and presence of a typical cleavage site in the fusion (F) protein (112R-R-Q-K-R downward arrowF117) confirmed the velogenic nature of these isolates. Phylogenetic analysis classified both isolates as members of genotype VII within class-II. Furthermore, based upon the hypervariable region of the F gene (375 nt), isolates showed clustering within sub-genotype VIIi. Similarity index and parallel comparison revealed a higher nucleotide divergence from commonly used vaccine strains; LaSota (21%) and Mukteswar (17%). A comparative residues analysis with representative strains of different genotypes, including vaccine strains, revealed a number of substitutions at important structural and functional domains within the F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins. Together, the results highlight consistent evolution among circulating NDVs supporting extensive surveillance of the virus in waterfowl to better elucidate epidemiology, evolutionary relationships and their impacts on commercial and backyard poultry.
197	29698066	A Novel Technique for Extracapsular Repair of the Intertarsal Joint in a Duck.	Baron HR, Phalen DN, Gonzalez MS	J Avian Med Surg	 2018 Mar;32(1):57-64	 doi: 101647/2017-246	The intertarsal joint is a synovial roll-and-glide joint. Ligament damage and luxations of this joint are often the result of traumatic injury or growth deformities and result in significant functional impairment. A 9-month-old female Pekin duck ( Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) was examined because of progressive, nonweight-bearing lameness of the left leg. Moderate effusive swelling was present at the level of the left intertarsal joint, without radiographic evidence of bone involvement. The duck failed to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and analgesia and was diagnosed with rupture of the medial collateral ligament. Extracapsular surgical correction using bone tunnels and circumferential nylon suture on the medial aspect of the intertarsal joint led to a complete clinical resolution with normal return to function 2 weeks after surgery. This report reviews the anatomy and function of the intertarsal joint in the duck and details a simple extracapsular repair technique useful in the correction of collateral ligament rupture in this joint of ducks.
198	29684538	Molecular cloning, characterization and expression analysis of C/EBP alpha, beta and delta in adipose-related tissues and adipocyte of duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Qiu J, Wang W, Hu S, Wang Y, Sun W, Hu J, Gan X, Wang J	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 2018 Jul;221-222:29-43	 doi: 101016/jcbpb201804004 Epub 2018 Apr 21	CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, beta, delta (C/EBP alpha, beta, delta) are essential transcriptional factors in regulating adipose development. However, information about their sequence characteristics and functions during adipocyte development still remains scarce in birds. In present study, we found that duck C/EBP alpha, beta, delta differed in their phosphorylation sites and low complexity regions (LCRs) among their orthologs and paralogs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that C/EBP alpha, beta, delta had different evolutionary patterns, and each of duck C/EBP alpha, beta, delta was strikingly diverged from orthologs of other Aves. Results of quantitative real-time PCR exhibited that C/EBP alpha, beta, delta were all highly expressed in duck adipose tissues. Indeed, investigations of changes in both their mRNA levels and lipid droplet content during duck adipocytes differentiation showed that their expression profiles were closely related to cellular lipid accumulation. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering analysis of the C/EBPs and lipid metabolism-related genes expression profiles showed that C/EBP alpha was clustered with genes related to lipolysis, lipogenesis and fatty acid desaturation, whereas C/EBP beta, delta were clustered with genes related to de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid elongation, which were different from mammals. In summary, C/EBP alpha, beta, delta of duck differ from other species in their structures and have different effects on lipid metabolism during adipocytes differentiation. This research serve as a foundation for further investigations about avian C/EBP alpha, beta, delta in adipocytes differentiation and adipose development.
199	29670093	Wild ducks excrete highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N8 (2014-2015) without clinical or pathological evidence of disease.	van den Brand JMA, Verhagen JH, Veldhuis Kroeze EJB, van de Bildt MWG, Bodewes R, Herfst S, Richard M, Lexmond P, Bestebroer TM, Fouchier RAM, Kuiken T	Emerg Microbes Infect	 2018 Apr 18;7(1):67	 doi: 101038/s41426-018-0070-9	Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is essentially a poultry disease. Wild birds have traditionally not been involved in its spread, but the epidemiology of HPAI has changed in recent years. After its emergence in southeastern Asia in 1996, H5 HPAI virus of the Goose/Guangdong lineage has evolved into several sub-lineages, some of which have spread over thousands of kilometers via long-distance migration of wild waterbirds. In order to determine whether the virus is adapting to wild waterbirds, we experimentally inoculated the HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group A from 2014 into four key waterbird species-Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), common teal (Anas crecca), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and common pochard (Aythya ferina)-and compared virus excretion and disease severity with historical data of the HPAI H5N1 virus infection from 2005 in the same four species. Our results showed that excretion was highest in Eurasian wigeons for the 2014 virus, whereas excretion was highest in common pochards and mallards for the 2005 virus. The 2014 virus infection was subclinical in all four waterbird species, while the 2005 virus caused clinical disease and pathological changes in over 50% of the common pochards. In chickens, the 2014 virus infection caused systemic disease and high mortality, similar to the 2005 virus. In conclusion, the evidence was strongest for Eurasian wigeons as long-distance vectors for HPAI H5N8 virus from 2014. The implications of the switch in species-specific virus excretion and decreased disease severity may be that the HPAI H5 virus more easily spreads in the wild-waterbird population.
200	29651281	The Potential of Isolation Source to Predict Colonization in Avian Hosts: A Case Study in Campylobacter jejuni Strains From Three Bird Species.	Atterby C, Mourkas E, Meric G, Pascoe B, Wang H, Waldenstrom J, Sheppard SK, Olsen B, Jarhult JD, Ellstrom P	Front Microbiol	 2018 Mar 29;9:591	 doi: 103389/fmicb201800591 eCollection 2018	Campylobacter jejuni is the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, infecting humans mostly through consumption of contaminated poultry. C. jejuni is common in the gut of wild birds, and shows distinct strain-specific association to particular bird species. This contrasts with farm animals, in which several genotypes co-exist. It is unclear if the barriers restricting transmission between host species of such specialist strains are related to environmental factors such as contact between host species, bacterial survival in the environment, etc., or rather to strain specific adaptation to the intestinal environment of specific hosts. We compared colonization dynamics in vivo between two host-specific C. jejuni from a song thrush (ST-1304 complex) and a mallard (ST-995), and a generalist strain from chicken (ST-21 complex) in a wild host, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). In 18-days infection experiments, the song thrush strain showed only weak colonization and was cleared from all birds after 10 days, whereas both mallard and chicken strains remained stable. When the chicken strain was given 4 days prior to co-infection of the same birds with a mallard strain, it was rapidly outcompeted by the latter. In contrast, when the mallard strain was given 4 days prior to co-infection with the chicken strain, the mallard strain remained and expansion of the chicken strain was delayed. Our results suggest strain-specific differences in the ability of C. jejuni to colonize mallards, likely associated with host origin. This difference might explain observed host association patterns in C. jejuni from wild birds.
201	29620470	Study of an Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N8 in Commercial Pekin Ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) in California.	Stoute S, Crossley B, Shivaprasad HL	Avian Dis	 2018 Mar;62(1):101-108	 doi: 101637/11773-112017-Reg1	A February 2015 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 in a flock of commercial Pekin ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) in California was investigated in detail. Approximately 17,349 five-wk-old ducks experienced an increased mortality from a normal of eight birds per day to 24, 18, 24, 33, and 61 birds per day, respectively, in the last 5 days prior to flock depopulation. Clinically, there was decreased water and feed consumption, and approximately 1.0% of the affected flock exhibited neurologic signs. Necropsy of five clinically ill ducks revealed pale, patchy areas on the epicardium in two birds, pale foci of necrosis in the liver of one bird, and airsacculitis in three birds. Histopathology revealed multifocal nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, myositis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, and glossitis. Immunohistochemistry revealed avian influenza virus (AIV) nucleoprotein in the nucleus and cytoplasm of various cells in the aforementioned organs, as well as in the skin and feathers. Eight of the 10 sera samples tested were positive for avian influenza antibodies by agar gel immunodiffusion serology. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs taken from 15 birds, as well as from the lungs, livers, pancreas, and spleen, were positive for AIV by real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT) PCR. AIV was isolated and typed as Eurasian lineage HPAI H5N8, clade 2.3.4.4, by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, IA. Extensive surveillance of birds for AIV around the 10-km zone did not reveal any additional cases. Ducks on the affected premises were humanely euthanatized by foam and composted in-house, the houses were heated to 57 C for 4 days, and swabs were taken periodically from the compost to ensure negativity for AIV by rRT-PCR. The compost and litter were then removed, and the house was pressure cleaned, disinfected, and repopulated approximately 120 days after euthanatization of the ducks.
202	29614085	Interactions between seed traits and digestive processes determine the germinability of bird-dispersed seeds.	Kleyheeg E, Claessens M, Soons MB	PLoS One	 2018 Apr 3;13(4):e0195026	 doi: 101371/journalpone0195026 eCollection 2018	Waterbirds disperse a wide range of plant seeds via their guts, promoting biotic connectivity between isolated habitat patches. However, the intensity of digestive forces encountered by seeds, and therefore their potential to survive digestive tract passage, varies within and between waterbird species. Here, we investigate under controlled conditions how the interaction between seed traits and digestive strategies affect the germinability of seeds following waterbird-mediated dispersal. We exposed seeds of 30 wetland plant species to the main digestive processes in the dabbling duck digestive system: mechanical, chemical and intestinal digestion. These were simulated by 1) a pressure test and scarification treatment, 2) incubation in simulated gastric juice, and 3) incubation in intestinal contents of culled mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We evaluated their separate and combined effects on seed germination, and identified the role of seed size and seed coat traits in resisting the digestive forces. Seeds were generally resistant to separate digestive processes, but highly sensitive to a combination. Resistance to mechanical break-down was reduced by up to 80% by chemical pre-treatment, especially for seeds with permeable coats. Scarified seeds were 12-17% more vulnerable to chemical and intestinal digestive processes than undamaged seeds. Large seeds and seeds with thin, permeable coats were particularly sensitive to chemical and intestinal digestion. These results indicate that efficient digestion of seeds requires multiple digestive processes. The gizzard, responsible for mechanical digestion, plays a key role in seed survival. Omnivorous birds, which have relatively light gizzards compared to pure herbivores or granivores, are thus most likely to disperse seeds successfully. Regardless of digestive strategy, small seeds with tough seed coats are most resistant to digestion and may be adapted to endozoochorous dispersal by waterbirds.
203	29575915	Transfer of egg white proteins and activation of proteases during the development of Anas platyrhynchos domestica embryo.	Shbailat SJ, Abuassaf RA	Acta Biol Hung	 2018 Mar;69(1):72-85	 doi: 101556/01868201816	The route of egg white transfer into the yolk and the mechanisms underlying the digestion of egg proteins are unexplored in the fertilized egg of the duck, Anas platyrhynchos domestica. Here, we investigated the route(s) of egg white transfer and we determined the type of activated proteases during duck embryo development. Initially, we tested the electrophoretic patterns of egg proteins throughout development. Then, we used lysozyme as a reference protein to follow egg white transfer and we measured its activity. After that, we determined the type of activated proteases by employing different types of protease inhibitors. Several presumptive egg white protein bands appeared in different egg compartments. Also, lysozyme activity was detected chronologically on day 15 in the extraembryonic fluid, on day 17 in the amniotic and intestinal fluids and on day 19 in the yolk. Furthermore, acidic aspartic proteases seemed to be activated at hatch in the intestine and late in development in the yolk. Our results suggest that the main route of egg white transfer into the yolk is through the amniotic cavity and intestinal lumen. Also, the transferred egg white and endogenous yolk proteins are probably digested by the activated acidic proteases in the intestine and yolk.
204	29557225	Molecular Cloning, Characterization, and Temporal Expression Profile of Troponin I Type 1 (TNNI1) Gene in Skeletal Muscle During Early Development of Gaoyou Duck (Anas Platyrhynchos Domestica).	Shu J, Ji G, Zhang M, Tu Y, Shan Y, Liu Y, Ju X, Zhang D	Anim Biotechnol	 2019 Apr;30(2):118-128	 doi: 101080/1049539820181444620 Epub 2018 Mar 20	TNNI1 encodes the slow skeletal muscle isoform of troponin I. In the present study, the basic characteristic and expressing profile of the TNNI1 gene was first explored in Gaoyou ducks. Full-length TNNI1 cDNA of Gaoyou duck was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA consisted of a 57-base pair (bp) 5'UTR, a 345-bp 3'UTR, and a 564-bp open reading frame. The predicted protein was predicted to be hydrophilic, nonsecretory protein and contained 17 phosphorylation sites. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic tree analyses showed that the predicted protein was relatively conserved in avian. TNNI1 mRNA could be detected in every tissue analyzed at 70 days of age, and the muscle tissues had relatively high expression level, with the highest level seen in leg muscle. The TNNI1 gene was differentially expressed in the breast muscle and leg muscle during embryonic and posthatching development. Our findings reveal the sequence characterization and expression patterns of the TNNI1 gene, which may provide correlative evidence that TNNI1 gene plays an important role in duck muscle fiber development and meat quality.
205	29535295	A four-year survey (2011-2014) of West Nile virus infection in humans, mosquitoes and birds, including the 2012 meningoencephalitis outbreak in Tunisia.	Monastiri A, Mechri B, Vazquez-Gonzalez A, Ar Gouilh M, Chakroun M, Loussaief C, Mastouri M, Dimassi N, Boughzala L, Aouni M, Serra-Cobo J	Emerg Microbes Infect	 2018 Mar 14;7(1):28	 doi: 101038/s41426-018-0028-y	A West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak occurred in Tunisia between mid-July and December 2012. To assess the epidemiological features of the WNV transmission cycle, human cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with suspected cases (n = 79), Culex pipiens mosquitoes (n = 583) and serum specimens from domestic and migratory birds (n = 70) were collected for 4 years (2011-2014) in the Tunisian Sahel region. Viral testing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The WNV genome was detected in 7 patients (8.8%), 4 Culex pipiens pools, and a domestic mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). All PCR-positive samples were from the Monastir region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two different WNV strain groups circulated, and isolates from the reservoir (bird), vector (Culex pipiens), and dead-end hosts (humans) were closely related. The Monastir region is a hot-spot for WNV infection, and the reiterative presence of WNV over the years has increased the risk of viral reemergence in Tunisia, which highlights the need for more enhanced and effective WNV surveillance in humans with public awareness campaigns strengthened by monitoring mosquitoes and maintaining avian surveillance for early detection of WNV circulation.
206	29528812	Comparative analysis of Campylobacter isolates from wild birds and chickens using MALDI-TOF MS, biochemical testing, and DNA sequencing.	Lawton SJ, Weis AM, Byrne BA, Fritz H, Taff CC, Townsend AK, Weimer BC, Mete A, Wheeler S, Boyce WM	J Vet Diagn Invest	 2018 May;30(3):354-361	 doi: 101177/1040638718762562 Epub 2018 Mar 12	Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was compared to conventional biochemical testing methods and nucleic acid analyses (16S rDNA sequencing, hippurate hydrolysis gene testing, whole genome sequencing [WGS]) for species identification of Campylobacter isolates obtained from chickens ( Gallus gallus domesticus, n = 8), American crows ( Corvus brachyrhynchos, n = 17), a mallard duck ( Anas platyrhynchos, n = 1), and a western scrub-jay ( Aphelocoma californica, n = 1). The test results for all 27 isolates were in 100% agreement between MALDI-TOF MS, the combined results of 16S rDNA sequencing, and the hippurate hydrolysis gene PCR ( p = 0.0027, kappa = 1). Likewise, the identifications derived from WGS from a subset of 14 isolates were in 100% agreement with the MALDI-TOF MS identification. In contrast, biochemical testing misclassified 5 isolates of C. jejuni as C. coli, and 16S rDNA sequencing alone was not able to differentiate between C. coli and C. jejuni for 11 sequences ( p = 0.1573, kappa = 0.0857) when compared to MALDI-TOF MS and WGS. No agreement was observed between MALDI-TOF MS dendrograms and the phylogenetic relationships revealed by rDNA sequencing or WGS. Our results confirm that MALDI-TOF MS is a fast and reliable method for identifying Campylobacter isolates to the species level from wild birds and chickens, but not for elucidating phylogenetic relationships among Campylobacter isolates.

Choi KS, Kim JY, Lee HJ, Jang MJ, Kwon HM, Sung HW	J Wildl Dis	 2018 Jul;54(3):558-563	 doi: 107589/2017-07-158 Epub 2018 Mar 8	Eleven avian paramyxovirus type 6 (APMV-6) isolates from Eurasian Wigeon ( n=5; Anas penelope), Mallards ( n=2; Anas platyrhynchos), and unknown species of wild ducks ( n=4) from Korea were analyzed based on the nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid sequences of the fusion (F) gene. Fecal samples were collected in 2010-14. Genotypes were assigned based on phylogenetic analyses. Our results revealed that APMV-6 could be classified into at least two distinct genotypes, G1 and G2. The open reading frame (ORF) of the G1 genotype was 1,668 nt in length, and the putative F0 cleavage site sequence was (113)PAPEPRL(119). The G2 genotype viruses included five isolates from Eurasian wigeons and four isolates from unknown waterfowl species, together with two reference APMV-6 strains from the Red-necked Stint ( Calidris ruficollis) from Japan and an unknown duck from Italy. There was an N-truncated ORF (1,638 nt), due to an N-terminal truncation of 30 nt in the signal peptide region of the F gene, and the putative F0 cleavage site sequence was (103)SIREPRL(109). The genetic diversity and ecology of APMV-6 are discussed.
208	29407578	A rapid and transient innate immune response to avian influenza infection in mallards.	Helin AS, Wille M, Atterby C, Jarhult JD, Waldenstrom J, Chapman JR	Mol Immunol	 2018 Mar;95:64-72	 doi: 101016/jmolimm201801012 Epub 2018 Feb 3	The vertebrate innate immune system provides hosts with a rapid, non-specific response to a wide range of invading pathogens. However, the speed and duration of innate responses will be influenced by the co-evolutionary dynamics of specific host-pathogen combinations. Here, we show that low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI) subtype H1N1 elicits a strong but extremely transient innate immune response in its main wildlife reservoir, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Using a series of experimental and methodological improvements over previous studies, we followed the expression of retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and myxovirus resistance gene (Mx) in mallards semi-naturally infected with low pathogenic H1N1. One day post infection, both RIG-I and Mx were significantly upregulated in all investigated tissues. By two days post infection, the expression of both genes had generally returned to basal levels, and remained so for the remainder of the experiment. This is despite the fact that birds continued to actively shed viral particles throughout the study period. We additionally show that the spleen plays a particularly active role in the innate immune response to LPAI. Waterfowl and avian influenza viruses have a long co-evolutionary history, suggesting that the mallard innate immune response has evolved to provide a minimum effective response to LPAIs such that the viral infection is brought under control while minimising the damaging effects of a sustained immune response.
209	29373166	Ultrastructural study on the embryonic development of the orthokeratinized epithelium and its cornified layer (lingual nail) on the ventral surface of the lingual apex in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica).	Skieresz-Szewczyk K, Jackowiak H, Ratajczak M	Zoology (Jena)	 2018 Feb;126:36-45	 doi: 101016/jzool201712005 Epub 2017 Dec 28	The lingual nail as the cornified layer of the orthokeratinized epithelium in birds is responsible for the collection of solid food by pecking. The aim of the present study is to determine the manner of orthokeratinized epithelium development and assess the degree of readiness of the epithelium to fulfill its mechanical function at hatching. Three developmental phases are distinguished, i.e. embryonic, transformation and pre-hatching stage. In the embryonic stage lasting until day 13 of incubation the epithelium is composed of several layers of undifferentiated cells. During the transformation stage, from day 14 to 20 of incubation, the epithelium becomes differentiated to form three layers. A characteristic feature is the formation of osmophilic granules in the superficial layer, referred to as periderm granules. Until the pre-hatching stage the fibrous cytoskeleton of epithelial cells and an impermeable epithelial barrier are gradually developed. In the pre-hatching stage, a cornified lingual nail is formed, while the periderm is exfoliated. At hatching the orthokeratinized epithelium and lingual nail are fully developed and ready to perform feeding activities. The presence of periderm, similarly as in the epidermis, indicates the ectodermal derivation of the oral cavity epithelium. Moreover, occurrence of osmophilic granules may be considered as evidence for the phylogenetic affinity of birds and reptiles.
210	29286260	Molecular Characterization of Avian Paramyxovirus Types 4 and 8 Isolated from Wild Migratory Waterfowl in Mongolia.	Tseren-Ochir EO, Yuk SS, Khishgee B, Kwon JH, Noh JY, Hong WT, Jeong JH, Gwon GB, Jeong S, Kim YJ, Kim JB, Lee JH, Kim KJ, Damdinjav B, Song CS	J Wildl Dis	 2018 Apr;54(2):342-346	 doi: 107589/2017-03-067 Epub 2017 Dec 29	Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) constitute some of the most globally prevalent avian viruses and are frequently isolated from wild migratory bird species. Using 1,907 fresh fecal samples collected during the 2012 avian influenza surveillance program, we identified two serotypes of APMV: APMV-4 ( n=10) and APMV-8 ( n=1). Sequences for these isolates phylogenetically clustered with Asian APMV-4 and APMV-8 recently isolated from wild birds in Korea, Japan, China, and Kazakhstan. Analysis by DNA barcoding indicated that the Mongolian APMV-4 and APMV-8 strains were isolated from Anseriformes species including Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos) and Whooper Swans ( Cygnus cygnus). The close genetic relatedness to Asian isolates, and to similar host species, suggested that wild bird species in the Anatidae family might play an important role as a natural reservoir in the spread of APMV-4 and APMV-8. However, we did not find conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis owing to the limited number of strains that could be isolated. Enhanced surveillance of poultry and wild bird populations in Asia is therefore crucial for the understanding of global AMPV transmission, ecology, evolution, and epidemiology.
211	29242677	Infection reduces anti-predator behaviors in house finches.	Adelman JS, Mayer C, Hawley DM	J Avian Biol	 2017 Apr;48(4):519-528	 doi: 101111/jav01058 Epub 2017 Jan 20	Infectious diseases can cause host mortality through direct or indirect mechanisms, including altered behavior. Diminished anti-predator behavior is among the most-studied causes of indirect mortality during infection, particularly for systems in which a parasite's life-cycle requires transmission from prey to predator. Significantly less work has examined whether directly-transmitted parasites and pathogens also reduce anti-predator behaviors. Here we test whether the directly-transmitted bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), reduces responses to predation-related stimuli in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). MG causes conjunctivitis and reduces survival among free-living finches, but rarely causes mortality in captivity, suggesting a role for indirect mechanisms. Wild-caught finches were individually housed in captivity and exposed to the following treatments: 1) visual presence of a stuffed, mounted predator (a Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii)) or control object (a vase or a stuffed, mounted mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos)), 2) vocalizations of the same predator and non-predator, 3) approach of a researcher to enclosures, and 4) simulated predator attack (capture by hand). MG infection reduced anti-predator responses during visual exposure to a mounted predator and simulated predator attack, even for birds without detectable visual obstruction from conjunctivitis. However, MG infection did not significantly alter responses during human approach or audio playback. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that predation plays a role in MG-induced mortality in the wild, with reduced locomotion, a common form of sickness behavior for many taxa, as a likely mechanism. Our results therefore suggest that additional research on the role of sickness behaviors in predation could prove illuminating.
212	29211883	Carcass characteristics, meat quality, and fatty acid composition of wild-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Janiszewski P, Murawska D, Hanzal V, Gesek M, Michalik D, Zawacka M	Poult Sci	 2018 Feb 1;97(2):709-715	 doi: 103382/ps/pex335	The aim of this study was to determine the carcass characteristics, meat quality, and fatty acid composition of wild-living mallards. The experimental materials comprised 30 mallards (1:1 sex ratio) harvested during the hunting season in northeastern Poland. The carcasses were transported to the laboratory where they were weighed individually, plucked, dressed, and dissected. The proximate chemical composition and physicochemical properties of meat and the fatty acid profile of breast muscle lipids were determined, and a histological analysis was performed. Body weight (BW) and carcass weight were higher in males than in females (P </= 0.05), whereas the percentage share of carcass tissue components was similar in both sexes. Edible components accounted for approximately 60% (male symbol) to 60.7% (female symbol) of the total BW of mallards, including lean meat; 40.9% (male symbol) to 41.5% (female symbol), skin with subcutaneous fat; 10.7% (male symbol) to 10.8% (female symbol), and giblets; 8.3% (male symbol) to 8.4% (female symbol). Breast muscles had high protein content (23.51%female symbol to 23.6% male symbol) and low fat content (0.82% male symbol to 0.84% female symbol). In the fatty acid profile of breast muscle lipids, saturated fatty acids (SFA) accounted for 39.1% (male symbol) to 39.04% (female symbol), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-for 17.31% (male symbol) to 17.33% (female symbol) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-for 43.61% (female symbol) to 43.64% (male symbol). The diameters of type IIA and type IIB muscle fibers were lower in males than in females (P </= 0.05), whereas lipid storage sites in muscles were similar in both sexes. The values of cooking loss (CL), water-holding capacity (WHC), pH24, and color parameters of breast meat were comparable in males and females. The results of this study indicate that wild-living mallards, both males and females, are characterized by high meat quality, and that seasonal mallard harvests can provide meat with desirable eating attributes, attractive to consumers.
213	29170796	Factors Affecting Element Concentrations in Eggshells of Three Sympatrically Nesting Waterbirds in Northern Poland.	Kitowski I, Jakubas D, Indykiewicz P, Wiacek D	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2018 Feb;74(2):318-329	 doi: 101007/s00244-017-0481-y Epub 2017 Nov 23	Avian eggshells are convenient samples in biomonitoring studies, because they are easily accessible, especially from colonially or semicolonially breeding birds. In the present study, concentrations of 17 elements, including heavy metals and essential elements in post-hatch eggshells, were compared among three species of waterbirds of differing strategies for gaining reserves for egg production and diet: mallard, Anas platyrhynchos (ML, a capital breeder, mainly herbivorous), common tern, Sterna hirundo (CT, an income breeder, piscivorous) and black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus (BHG, mixed strategy, omnivorous) and breeding sympatrically in three sites in North Poland. Analyses revealed that Fe, Zn, and Cu levels differed the most in the studied species, which may be explained by various contributions of fish, aquatic plants, and soil invertebrates in their diets. Generally, the studied species' eggshells accumulated amounts of elements comparable to those reported for other waterbirds without putting the growth and development of the embryo at risk. The only exception was very high levels of Cr in ML and CT, which may be explained by their foraging on aquatic organisms in waterbodies polluted by this element. Intersite differences in eggshell concentrations of Ni, Sr, Hg and Cr in CT (an income breeder) may be explained by the influence of local pollution sources (small factories, polluted river).
214	29157881	Deformation of avian middle ear structures under static pressure loads, and potential regulation mechanisms.	Claes R, Muyshondt PGG, Dirckx JJJ, Aerts P	Zoology (Jena)	 2018 Feb;126:128-136	 doi: 101016/jzool201711003 Epub 2017 Nov 7	Static pressure changes can alter the configuration and mechanical behavior of the chain of ossicles, which may affect the acoustic transfer function. In mammals, the Eustachian tube plays an important role in restoring ambient middle ear pressure, hence restoring the acoustic transfer function and excluding barotrauma of the middle and inner ear. Ambient pressure fluctuations can be potentially extreme in birds and due to the simple structure of the avian middle ear (one ossicle, one muscle), regulation of the middle ear pressure via reflexive opening of the pharyngotympanic tube appears all the more important. In this study the deformations of the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) middle ear structures, as a result of middle ear pressure alterations, are quantified, using micro-CT scanning. It was experimentally tested whether reflexive opening of the pharyngotympanic tube to restore ambient middle ear pressure is present in chicken and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and whether this mechanism depends on sensing middle ear pressure indirectly via deformations of the middle ear components or sensing the middle ear pressure directly. A translation of the columella footplate was observed when middle ear pressure was kept at 1kPa and -1kPa relative to ambient pressure. Deformation of the tympanic membrane was larger than the columella footplate translation. Bending and deformation of the extracolumella was observed. Opening of the pharyngotympanic tube occurred at random pressure for both chicken and mallard when middle ear pressure was raised and lowered by 1.5kPa relative to ambient pressure. We also did not find a difference in middle ear venting rate when middle ear pressure was held constant at 0.5, 1, 1.5, -0.5, -1 and -1.5kPa for chickens and at 1, 2, 4, -1, -2 and -4kPa for mallards. As a result, no statement can be made about pressure within the avian middle ear being measured directly or indirectly. Our experiments do not support the presence of a short-loop reflexive control of pressure equilibration via the pharyngotympanic tube. However, it is still possible that triggering this loop requires additional sensorial input (e.g. visual, vestibular) or that it occurs voluntarily (being controlled at a higher brain level).
215	29157282	Updated molecular phylogenetic data for Opisthorchis spp. (Trematoda: Opisthorchioidea) from ducks in Vietnam.	Dao TTH, Nguyen TTG, Gabriel S, Bui KL, Dorny P, Le TH	Parasit Vectors	 2017 Nov 21;10(1):575	 doi: 101186/s13071-017-2514-9	BACKGROUND: An opisthorchiid liver fluke was recently reported from ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in Binh Dinh Province of Central Vietnam, and referred to as "Opisthorchis viverrini-like". This species uses common cyprinoid fishes as second intermediate hosts as does Opisthorchis viverrini, with which it is sympatric in this province. In this study, we refer to the liver fluke from ducks as "Opisthorchis sp. BD2013", and provide new sequence data from the mitochondrial (mt) genome and the nuclear ribosomal transcription unit. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to clarify the basal taxonomic position of this species from ducks within the genus Opisthorchis (Digenea: Opisthorchiidae). METHODS: Adults and eggs of liver flukes were collected from ducks, metacercariae from fishes (Puntius brevis, Rasbora aurotaenia, Esomus metallicus) and cercariae from snails (Bithynia funiculata) in different localities in Binh Dinh Province. From four developmental life stage samples (adults, eggs, metacercariae and cercariae), the complete cytochrome b (cob), nicotinamide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genes, and near-complete 18S and partial 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences were obtained by PCR-coupled sequencing. The alignments of nucleotide sequences of concatenated cob + nad1 + cox1, and of concatenated 18S + 28S were separately subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Homologous sequences from other trematode species were included in each alignment. RESULTS: Phylogenetic trees were inferred from concatenated (cob + nad1 + cox1) nucleotide sequences and combined 18S + 28S nucleotide sequences of five Opisthorchis sp. BD2013 samples and additional reference taxa. Both trees demonstrated the anticipated clustering of taxa within the superfamily Opisthorchioidea, the paraphyly of the genus Opisthorchis and the sister-species relationship of Opisthorchis sp. BD2013 with O. viverrini. CONCLUSIONS: While it is likely that Opisthorchis sp. BD2013 is distinct from O. viverrini, it is clearly a sister taxon of O. viverrini within the limited number of Opisthorchis species for which appropriate sequence data are available. The new sequences provided here will assist the diagnosis and the taxonomic clarification of the opisthorchiid species.
216	29139147	The development of lingual glands in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica): 3D-reconstruction, LM, and SEM study.	Skieresz-Szewczyk K, Cornillie P, Jackowiak H	J Morphol	 2018 Mar;279(3):319-329	 doi: 101002/jmor20774 Epub 2017 Nov 15	The major salivary glands of birds develop by branching or elongation of the epithelial cords. The development of the minor salivary glands in form of the lingual glands has never been described. Among birds, only Anatidae have three types of the lingual glands: rostral, caudo-lateral, and caudo-medial lingual glands. The study aims to characterize the manner and rate of the lingual glands development in the domestic duck and their topographical arrangement relative to the hyoid apparatus. The study reveals that all three types of the lingual glands develop by branching. We describe five stages of the lingual glands development in the domestic ducks: prebud, initial bud, pseudoglandular, canalicular, and terminal bud stage. The pattern of the lingual glands development in birds is similar to that described for mammals, with the exception, that the terminal buds are formed at the same time as the lumen of the glands. Generally, the rostral lingual gland starts to branch earlier than the caudal lingual glands. The 3D-reconstruction shows the location and direction of lingual gland development relative to the entoglossal cartilage and basibranchial bone. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy allow to characterize the histogenesis of the embryonic epithelium into glandular epithelium. At a time of hatching only secretory units of caudal lingual glands resemble the secretory units of the adult domestic duck. The rostral and caudo-lateral lingual glands are arranged on the sides of the entoglossal cartilage and basibranchial bone and caudo-madial lingual glands are located over the basibranchial bone. We suggest that such an arrangement of the lingual glands in the domestic duck is important during food intake and responsible for reduction of friction and formation of food bites.

Langley DB, Crossett B, Schofield P, Jackson J, Zeraati M, Maltby D, Christie M, Burnett D, Brink R, Goodnow C, Christ D	Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol	 2017 Nov 1;73(Pt 11):910-920	 doi: 101107/S2059798317013730 Epub 2017 Oct 25	Duck egg lysozyme (DEL) is a widely used model antigen owing to its capacity to bind with differential affinity to anti-chicken egg lysozyme antibodies. However, no structures of DEL have so far been reported, and the situation had been complicated by the presence of multiple isoforms and conflicting reports of primary sequence. Here, the structures of two DEL isoforms from the eggs of the commonly used Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) are reported. Using structural analyses in combination with mass spectrometry, non-ambiguous DEL primary sequences are reported. Furthermore, the structures and sequences determined here enable rationalization of the binding affinity of DEL for well documented landmark anti-lysozyme antibodies.

Phillips A, Fiorello CV, Baden RM, Liu JH, Burmas NC, Ruvalcaba CA, Monroy R, Mohr FC, Gehring R, Delplanque JP, Clemons KV, Stevens DA, Tell LA	Med Mycol	 2018 Apr 1;56(3):322-331	 doi: 101093/mmy/myx049	Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that primarily affects the respiratory tract. Amphotericin B has broad antifungal activity and is commonly used to treat aspergillosis, a fungal pneumonia that is a common sequela in oiled waterfowl as well as other birds in wildlife rehabilitation. Pharmacokinetic parameters of nebulized amphotericin B in an avian model have been reported, but those of direct intratracheal delivery have yet to be established. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a single 3 mg/kg dose of liposomal amphotericin B delivered intratracheally using a commercial atomizer would achieve plasma and lung tissue concentrations exceeding targeted minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Aspergillus species in adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Following intratracheal delivery, amphotericin B was present in lung parenchyma at concentrations above the targeted MIC of 1 mug/g for up to 9 days post-administration; however, distribution of the drug was uneven, with the majority of the drug concentrated in one lung lobe. Concentrations in the contralateral lung lobe and the kidneys were above the targeted MIC 1 day after administration but declined exponentially with a half-life of approximately 2 days. Plasma concentrations were never above the targeted MIC. Histological examination of the trachea, bronchi, lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys did not reveal any toxic changes. Using a commercial atomizer, intratracheal delivery of amphotericin B at 3 mg/kg resulted in lung parenchyma concentrations above 1 mug/ml with no discernable systemic effects. Further studies to establish a system of drug delivery to both sides of the pulmonary parenchyma need to be performed, and the efficacy of this treatment for disease prevention remains to be determined.
219	28968179	Antimicrobial Susceptibility and Genotypic Characteristic of Campylobacter spp. Isolates from Free-Living Birds in Poland.	Krawiec M, Wozniak-Biel A, Bednarski M, Wieliczko A	Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis	 2017 Nov;17(11):755-763	 doi: 101089/vbz20172116 Epub 2017 Oct 2	Campylobacter spp. is the most commonly reported, bacterial cause of human foodborne infection worldwide. Commercial poultry and free-living birds are natural reservoirs of three particular species: Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari. The aim of this study was to determine the genotypic characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility of 43 Campylobacter strains, obtained from free-living birds, in Poland. In total, 700 birds were examined. The strains were isolated from 43 birds (6.14%) from the feces of 7 wild bird species: Mallard ducks Anas platyrhynchos (29 positive/121 tested), great cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo (5/77), velvet scoters Melanitta fusca (4/30), tawny owls Strix aluco (2/5), common buzzard Buteo buteo (1/3), rook Corvus frugilegus (1/6), and Eurasian tree sparrow Passer montanus (1/30). Thirty-eight (88.37%) of obtained strains belonged to C. jejuni and five (11.63%) to C. coli. Other 428 examined birds from different bird species were Campylobacter negative. The antimicrobial susceptibility to nine antimicrobials was also studied in investigated isolates of Campylobacter spp. Sixteen of the examined strains (37.21% of all positive samples) showed susceptibility to all of the nine antimicrobials. Moreover, the prevalence of selected virulence genes, such as flaA, cadF, ceuE, virB11, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC were all analyzed. The virulence gene that was found most frequently in total number of Campylobacter strains was ceuE (72.10%) and other genes, such as flaA, cadF, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC, were found in over 60% of all examined strains. Variable antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of different virulence genes of examined strains, isolated from free-living birds, suggest that special attention should be given to wild birds and any potential approaches to the control of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter should be discussed.
220	28964597	Assessment of dose rate to terrestrial biota in the area around coal fired power plant applying ERICA tool and RESRAD BIOTA code.	Cujic M, Dragovic S	J Environ Radioact	 2018 Aug;188:108-114	 doi: 101016/jjenvrad201709014 Epub 2017 Sep 28	This paper presents the environmental radiation risk assessment based on two software program approaches ERICA Tool (version 1.2) and RESRAD BIOTA (version 1.5) to estimate dose rates to terrestrial biota in the area around the largest coal fired power plant in Serbia. For dose rate assessment software's default reference animals and plants and the best estimated values of activity concentrations of (238)U, (234)U, (234)Th, (232)Th, (230)Th, (226)Ra, (210)Pb, (210)Po, (137)Cs in soil were used. Both approaches revealed the highest contribution to the internal dose rate due to (226)Ra and (210)Po, while (137)Cs contributed the most to the external dose rate. In the investigated area total dose rate to biota derived using ERICA Tool ranged from 0.3 to 14.4 muGy h(-1). The natural radionuclides exhibited significantly higher contribution to the total dose rate than the artificial one. In the investigated area, only dose rate for lichens and bryophytes exceeded ERICA Tool screening value of total dose rate of 10 muGy h(-1) suggested as confident that environmental risks are negligible. The assessed total dose rates for reference animals and plants using RESRAD BIOTA were found to be 7 and 3 muGy h(-1), respectively. In RESRAD BIOTA - Level 3, 10 species (Lumbricus terrestris, Rana lessonae, Sciurus vulgaris, Anas platyrhynchos, Lepus europaeus, Vulpes vulpes, Capreolus capreolus, Suss crofa, Quercu srobur, Tilia spp.) representative for the study area were modeled. Among them the highest total dose rate (4.5 muGy h(-1)) was obtained for large mammals. Differences in the predicted dose rates to biota using the two software programs are the consequence of the difference in the values of transfer parameters used to calculate activity concentrations in biota. Doses of ionizing radiation estimated in this study will not exhibit deterministic effects at the population level. Thus, the obtained results indicate no significant radiation impact of coal fired power plant operation on terrestrial biota. This paper confirms the use ERICA Tool and RESRAD BIOTA softwares as flexible and effective means of radiation impact assessment.
221	28899357	Comparative transcriptome analysis provides clues to molecular mechanisms underlying blue-green eggshell color in the Jinding duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wang Z, Meng G, Bai Y, Liu R, Du Y, Su L	BMC Genomics	 2017 Sep 12;18(1):725	 doi: 101186/s12864-017-4135-2	BACKGROUND: In birds, blue-green eggshell color (BGEC) is caused by biliverdin, a bile pigment derived from the degradation of heme and secreted in the eggshell by the shell gland. Functionally, BGEC might promote the paternal investment of males in the nest and eggs. However, little is known about its formation mechanisms. Jinding ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) are an ideal breed for research into the mechanisms, in which major birds lay BGEC eggs with minor individuals laying white eggs. Using this breed, this study aimed to provide insight into the mechanisms via comparative transcriptome analysis. RESULTS: Blue-shelled ducks (BSD) and white-shelled ducks (WSD) were selected from two populations, forming 4 groups (3 ducks/group): BSD1 and WSD1 from population 1 and BSD2 and WSD2 from population 2. Twelve libraries from shell glands were sequenced using the Illumina RNA-seq platform, generating an average of 41 million clean reads per library, of which 55.9% were mapped to the duck reference genome and assembled into 31,542 transcripts. Expression levels of 11,698 genes were successfully compared between all pairs of 4 groups. Of these, 464 candidate genes were differentially expressed between cross-phenotype groups, but not for between same-phenotype groups. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that 390 candidate genes were annotated with 2234 GO terms. No candidate genes were directly involved in biosynthesis or transport of biliverdin. However, the integral components of membrane, metal ion transport, cholesterol biosynthesis, signal transduction, skeletal system development, and chemotaxis were significantly (P < 0.05) overrepresented by candidate genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 464 candidate genes associated with duck BGEC, providing valuable information for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this trait. Given the involvement of membrane cholesterol contents, ions and ATP levels in modulating the transport activity of bile pigment transporters, the data suggest a potential association between duck BGEC and the transport activity of the related transporters.
222	28878764	Molecular Cloning, Characterization, and Anti-avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli Innate Immune Response of the Cherry Valley Duck CIITA Gene.	Li R, Guo M, Lin J, Chai T, Wei L	Front Microbiol	 2017 Aug 23;8:1629	 doi: 103389/fmicb201701629 eCollection 2017	Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) transactivator (CIITA) is a member of the pattern recognition receptor in cytoplasm, which is involved in host innate immune responses. In this study, the full-length cDNA of Cherry Valley duck CIITA (duCIITA) was cloned from the spleen of healthy Cherry Valley ducks for the first time. The CDs of duCIITA have 3648 bp and encode 1215 amino acids. The homology analysis of CIITAs amino acid sequence showed that the duCIITA has the highest identity with the Anas platyrhynchos (94.9%), followed by Gallus gallus and Meleagris gallopavo. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that duCIITA mRNA has a broad expression level in healthy Cherry Valley duck tissues. It was highly expressed in the lung and cerebellum, and lowly expressed in the rectum and esophagus. After the avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) O1K1 infection, the ducks exhibited the typical clinical symptoms, and a severe fibrinous exudate in the heart and liver surface was observed. Meanwhile, a significant up-regulation of duCIITA was detected in the infected liver. The inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 have a significant up-regulation in the infected liver, spleen and brain. In addition, knockdown of the duCIITA reduces antibacterial activity and inflammatory cytokine production of the duck embryo fibroblast cells. Our research is the first study of the cloning, tissue distribution, and antibacterial immune responses of duCIITA, and these findings imply that duCIITA was an important receptor, which was involved in the early stage of the antibacterial innate immune response to APEC O1K1 infection of Cherry Valley duck.
223	28874792	Surveillance for highly pathogenic influenza A viruses in California during 2014-2015 provides insights into viral evolutionary pathways and the spatiotemporal extent of viruses in the Pacific Americas Flyway.	Ramey AM, Hill NJ, Cline T, Plancarte M, De La Cruz S, Casazza ML, Ackerman JT, Fleskes JP, Vickers TW, Reeves AB, Gulland F, Fontaine C, Prosser DJ, Runstadler JA, Boyce WM	Emerg Microbes Infect	 2017 Sep 6;6(9):e80	 doi: 101038/emi201766	We used surveillance data collected in California before, concurrent with, and subsequent to an outbreak of highly pathogenic (HP) clade 2.3.4.4 influenza A viruses (IAVs) in 2014-2015 to (i) evaluate IAV prevalence in waterfowl, (ii) assess the evidence for spill-over infections in marine mammals and (iii) genetically characterize low-pathogenic (LP) and HP IAVs to refine inference on the spatiotemporal extent of HP genome constellations and to evaluate possible evolutionary pathways. We screened samples from 1496 waterfowl and 1142 marine mammals collected from April 2014 to August 2015 and detected IAV RNA in 159 samples collected from birds (n=157) and pinnipeds (n=2). HP IAV RNA was identified in three samples originating from American wigeon (Anas americana). Genetic sequence data were generated for a clade 2.3.4.4 HP IAV-positive diagnostic sample and 57 LP IAV isolates. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the HP IAV was a reassortant H5N8 virus with gene segments closely related to LP IAVs detected in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled in California and other IAVs detected in wild birds sampled within the Pacific Americas Flyway. In addition, our analysis provided support for common ancestry between LP IAVs recovered from waterfowl sampled in California and gene segments of reassortant HP H5N1 IAVs detected in British Columbia, Canada and Washington, USA. Our investigation provides evidence that waterfowl are likely to have played a role in the evolution of reassortant HP IAVs in the Pacific Americas Flyway during 2014-2015, whereas we did not find support for spill-over infections in potential pinniped hosts.
224	28837606	Maintenance of influenza A viruses and antibody response in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled during the non-breeding season in Alaska.	Spivey TJ, Lindberg MS, Meixell BW, Smith KR, Puryear WB, Davis KR, Runstadler JA, Stallknecht DE, Ramey AM	PLoS One	 2017 Aug 24;12(8):e0183505	 doi: 101371/journalpone0183505 eCollection 2017	Prevalence of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in northern-breeding waterfowl has previously been reported to reach an annual peak during late summer or autumn; however, little is known about IAV infection dynamics in waterfowl populations persisting at high-latitude regions such as Alaska, during winter. We captured mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) throughout the non-breeding season (August-April) of 2012-2015 in Fairbanks and Anchorage, the two largest cities in Alaska, to assess patterns of IAV infection and antibody production using molecular methods and a standard serologic assay. In addition, we used virus isolation, genetic sequencing, and a virus microneutralization assay to characterize viral subtypes and to evaluate the immune response of mallards captured on multiple occasions through time. We captured 923 mallards during three successive sampling years: Fairbanks in 2012/13 and 2013/14, and Anchorage in 2014/15. Prevalence varied by age, season, and year/site with high and relatively stable estimates throughout the non-breeding season. Infected birds were detected in all locations/seasons except early-winter in Fairbanks during 2013/14. IAVs with 17 combinations of hemagglutinin (H1-5, H7-9, H11, H12) and neuraminidase (N1-6, N8, N9) subtypes were isolated. Antibodies to IAVs were detected throughout autumn and winter for all sampling locations and years, however, seroprevalence was higher among adults and varied among years. Mallards exhibited individual heterogeneity with regard to immune response, providing instances of both seroconversion and seroreversion to detected viral subtypes. The probability that an individual transitioned from one serostatus to another varied by age, with juvenile mallards having higher rates of seroconversion and seroreversion than adults. Our study provides evidence that a diversity of IAVs circulate in populations of mallards wintering at urban locations in Alaska, and we suggest waterfowl wintering at high-latitudes may play an important role in maintenance of viruses across breeding seasons.
225	28808778	Audiogram of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) from 16 Hz to 9 kHz.	Hill EM	J Comp Physiol A Neuroethol Sens Neural Behav Physiol	 2017 Nov;203(11):929-934	 doi: 101007/s00359-017-1204-6 Epub 2017 Aug 14	The pure-tone thresholds of three mallard ducks were determined from 16 Hz to 9 kHz. The purpose was to determine whether the mallard duck hears infrasound, which then may potentially be used for navigation, similar to how it is proposed that pigeons use it for homing. At a level of 60 dB sound pressure level (re 20 muN/m(2)), their hearing range extends 6.85 octaves from 66 Hz to 7.6 kHz, with a best sensitivity of 12.5 dB at 2 kHz. However, at no frequency, including the lowest tested, were the ducks' thresholds lower than those of humans. Therefore, unlike pigeons and chickens, but like budgerigars, mallard ducks do not hear infrasound. Thus, the fact that a bird may fly long distances does not necessarily indicate that it hears infrasound.
226	28807621	Antitoxin therapy of natural avian botulism outbreaks occurred in Brazil.	Silva ROS, Gomez SYM, Medeiros LB, Marques MVR, Silva ASG, Mureb EN, Oliveira Junior CA, Favoretto SM, Lobato FCF, Martins NRS	Anaerobe	 2017 Dec;48:115-117	 doi: 101016/janaerobe201708005 Epub 2017 Aug 12	Botulism commonly affects water birds and it has recently been observed to be emerging in poultry production. In the present work, outbreaks of botulism in wild native species, such as the black-fronted Piping-guan (Aburria jacutinga), wild duck (Cairina moschata) and its crosses with mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are described. Following treatments with a commercial botulism antitoxin CD, 28 (96.5%) out of 29 animals fully recovered after 24-72 h. The antitoxin therapy was shown to be a useful option for the treatment of affected birds, including those that were severely affected.
227	28782536	Immunolesion of melanopsin neurons causes gonadal regression in Pekin drakes (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Potter H, Alenciks E, Frazier K, Porter A, Fraley GS	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2018 Jan 15;256:16-22	 doi: 101016/jygcen201708006 Epub 2017 Aug 4	Several light sensitive receptors have been described in the avian brain that are thought to regulate the reproductive axis independently from the eyes and pineal gland. Recently, our lab has described the presence of three of these photoneuroendocrine systems in the Pekin duck: opsin, opsin 5, & melanopsin. We set out to test the hypothesis that melanopsin receptive neurons are necessary to maintain seasonal reproductive status along with growth and development in the Pekin drake. To accomplish these goals we first investigated 50-week-old Pekin drakes that were housed in the aviary at Hope College under long day length (18h lights on) conditions in floor pens. To specifically lesion melanopsin-receptive neurons, 3mul of an anti-melanopsin-saporin conjugate (MSAP, 100ng/ul) was injected into the lateral ventricle (n=10). Control drakes were injected with 3mul of equimolar unconjugated anti-melanopsin and saporin (SAP, n=10). Reproductive behaviors were analyzed weekly in a test pen with adult hens and MSAP drakes showed a significant (p<0.01) reduction in reproductive behaviors after week 2. After 5weeks, drakes were euthanized and body weights were measured, and brains, pituitaries, and testes collected and stored for analyses. Mature MSAP-treated drakes had significantly (p<0.001) reduced relative teste weights compared to SAP controls. qRT-PCR analyses of hypothalamus showed a significant reduction (p<0.001) in GnRH and melanopsin mRNA levels, but not opsin 5, vertebrate ancient opsin, or opsin 2 (rhodopsin). Immunocytochemical analyses showed a significant reduction (p<0.01) in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity in the PMM. These data suggest that although blue light alone is not able to maintain testicular function, the blue-light sensitive melanopsin activity is critical to maintain gonadal function.
228	28768883	Structural coloured feathers of mallards act by simple multilayer photonics.	Stavenga DG, van der Kooi CJ, Wilts BD	J R Soc Interface	 2017 Aug;14(133)	 pii: rsif20170407 doi: 101098/rsif20170407	The blue colours of the speculum of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), both male and female, and the green head feathers of the male arise from light interacting with stacks of melanosomes residing in the feather barbules. Here, we show that the iridescent colours can be quantitatively explained with an optical multilayer model by using a position-dependent effective refractive index, which results from the varying ratio of melanin and keratin. Reflectance spectra obtained by multilayer modelling and three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain calculations were virtually identical. The spectral properties of the barbules' photonic structures are sensitive to variations in the multilayer period and the cortex thickness, but they are surprisingly robust to variations in the spatial parameters of the barbules' melanosome stacks. The blue and green reflectance spectra of the structural-coloured feathers correspond with the sensitivity spectra of the short- and middle-wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors, indicating their biological significance for intraspecific signalling.
229	28701165	Ethnomedicinal and cultural practices of mammals and birds in the vicinity of river Chenab, Punjab-Pakistan.	Altaf M, Javid A, Umair M, Iqbal KJ, Rasheed Z, Abbasi AM	J Ethnobiol Ethnomed	 2017 Jul 12;13(1):41	 doi: 101186/s13002-017-0168-5	BACKGROUND: Although, use of animal species in disease treatment and culture practices is as ancient as that of plant species; however ethnomedicinal uses and cultural values of animal species have rarely been reported. Present study is the first report on the medicinal uses of mammals and bird species in Pakistan. METHODS: Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were applied to collect qualitative and quantitative data from local informants (N = 109). Relative frequency of mention (RFM), fidelity level (FL), relative popularity level (RPL), similarity index (SI) and rank order priority (ROP) indices were used to analyzed the data. RESULTS: One hundred and eight species of animals, which include: 83% birds and 17% mammals were documented. In total 30 mammalian and 28 birds' species were used to treat various diseases such as rheumatic disorders, skin infections and sexual weakness among several others. Fats, flesh, blood, milk and eggs were the most commonly utilized body parts. Bos taurus, Bubalus bubalis, Capra aegagrus hircus, Felis domesticus, Lepus nigricollis dayanus and Ovis aries (mammals) and Anas platyrhynchos domesticus, Columba livia, Coturnix coturnix, Gallus gallus and Passer domesticus (birds) were the highly utilized species. Medicinal and cultural uses of 30% mammals and 46% birds were reported for the first time, whereas 33% mammals and 79% birds depicted zero similarity with previous reports. CONCLUSION: Present study exhibits significant ethnozoological knowledge of local inhabitants and their strong association with animal species, which could be helpful in sustainable use of biodiversity of the region. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of biological activities in the mammalian and birds' species with maximum fidelity level and frequency of mention could be important to discover animal based novel drugs. Some commonly used mammals and birds species of the study area.
230	28674238	Characterization of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) MHC class I gene in two duck lines.	Zhang L, Liu WJ, Wu JQ, Xu ML, Kong ZJ, Huang YY, Yang SH	J Genet	 2017 Jun;96(2):371-375	 doi: 101007/s12041-017-0773-z	To enrich gene polymorphism ofDuMHCI and provide data for further studies on disease resistance, 14DuMHCI genes from Weishan Ma duck and Cherry Valley duck were cloned, and their characterization were investigated. The overall conservation of the 14 alleles could be observed within the sequences, and relative conservation were also displayed in the peptide-binding domain and CD8 interaction sites. Based on full-length amino acid homology, MHC class I from different duck lines could be divided into 13 gene groups and three novel gene groups existed.Moreover, 14 key variable residues corresponding to gene groups division were exhibited on the homology modelling constructed based on the resolved protein structure of DuMHC I. This study explicit the characteristics of DuMHC I in the two duck lines and could contribute to design effective diagnostics and vaccines for the species against various infections.
231	28674235	Molecular characterization, expression profile of the FSHRgene and its association with egg production traits in muscovy duck.	Xu J, Gao X, Li X, Ye Q, Jebessa E, Abdalla BA, Nie Q	J Genet	 2017 Jun;96(2):341-351	 doi: 101007/s12041-017-0783-x	Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and its receptor play a key role in the follicular development and regulation of steroidogenesis in the ovary and spermatogenesis in the testis. The purpose of this study was to characterize themuscovy duck FSHR gene, identify SNPs and their association with egg production traits in muscovy ducks. Here, we cloned the complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of FSHR, and examined the expression patterns of FSHR gene in adult female muscovy duck tissues. The cloned cDNA of the muscovy duck FSHR gene shared high similarity to those of pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) (95.7%) and chicken (93.2%). Three different muscovy duck FSHR transcripts were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that the FSHR gene was expressed in all the 14 tested tissues, and the highest expression level was seen in the ovary. A total of 16 SNPs were identified, among which, four SNPs were located in the coding region of FSHR. The SNP C320T is significantly associated with egg production at 59 weeks of age (P < 0.05), whereas the SNP A227G is significantly associated with age at first egg stage (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the two SNPs (A227G and C320T) of FSHR gene are associated with egg production traits and could be potential markers that can be used for marker-assisted selection programmes to increase egg production in muscovy duck.
232	28640898	Competition between influenza A virus subtypes through heterosubtypic immunity modulates re-infection and antibody dynamics in the mallard duck.	Latorre-Margalef N, Brown JD, Fojtik A, Poulson RL, Carter D, Franca M, Stallknecht DE	PLoS Pathog	 2017 Jun 22;13(6):e1006419	 doi: 101371/journalppat1006419 eCollection 2017 Jun	Our overall hypothesis is that host population immunity directed at multiple antigens will influence the prevalence, diversity and evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) in avian populations where the vast subtype diversity is maintained. To investigate how initial infection influences the outcome of later infections with homologous or heterologous IAV subtypes and how viruses interact through host immune responses, we carried out experimental infections in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards were pre-challenged with an H3N8 low-pathogenic IAV and were divided into six groups. At five weeks post H3N8 inoculation, each group was challenged with a different IAV subtype (H4N5, H10N7, H6N2, H12N5) or the same H3N8. Two additional pre-challenged groups were inoculated with the homologous H3N8 virus at weeks 11 and 15 after pre-challenge to evaluate the duration of protection. The results showed that mallards were still resistant to re-infection after 15 weeks. There was a significant reduction in shedding for all pre-challenged groups compared to controls and the outcome of the heterologous challenges varied according to hemagglutinin (HA) phylogenetic relatedness between the viruses used. There was a boost in the H3 antibody titer after re-infection with H4N5, which is consistent with original antigenic sin or antigenic seniority and suggest a putative strategy of virus evasion. These results imply competition between related subtypes that could regulate IAV subtype population dynamics in nature. Collectively, we provide new insights into within-host IAV complex interactions as drivers of IAV antigenic diversity that could allow the circulation of multiple subtypes in wild ducks.
233	28627759	Vibrational biospectroscopy characterizes biochemical differences between cell types used for toxicological investigations and identifies alterations induced by environmental contaminants.	Heys KA, Shore RF, Pereira MG, Martin FL	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2017 Nov;36(11):3127-3137	 doi: 101002/etc3890 Epub 2017 Aug 3	The use of cell-based assays is essential in reducing the number of vertebrates used in the investigation of chemical toxicities and in regulatory toxicology assessment. An important factor in obtaining meaningful results that can be accurately extrapolated is the use of biologically appropriate cell lines. In the present preliminary study, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with multivariate analysis was used to assess the fundamental biomolecular differences between a commonly used cell line, MCF-7 cells, and an environmentally relevant cell line derived from mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) dermal fibroblasts. To better understand differences in basic cell biochemistry, the cells were analyzed in the untreated state or post exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ester (PBDE) congeners. The main spectral peaks in spectra from both cell types were associated with cellular macromolecules, particularly proteins and lipids, but the spectra also revealed some cell-specific differences. Spectra from untreated mallard fibroblasts spectra contained a large peak associated with lipids. The cell-related differences in lipids and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were also identified as regions of spectral alteration induced by PBDE and PCB exposure. Although lipid alterations were observed in post treatment spectra from both cell types, these may be of more significance to mallard fibroblasts, which may be the result of increased intracellular lipid as determined by Nile red staining. Untreated MCF-7 cell spectra contained unique peaks related to DNA and nucleic acids. The DNA-associated spectral regions were also identified as areas of considerable alteration in MCF-7 cells exposed to some congeners including PBDE 47 and PCB 153. The findings indicate that in their native state, MCF-7 and mallard cells have unique biochemical differences, which can be identified using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Such differences in biochemical composition may influence cell susceptibility to environmental contaminants and therefore influence the choice of cell type used in toxicology experiments. To our knowledge, the present study is the first study to analyze the biochemistry of a mallard dermal fibroblast cell line and to use ATR-FTIR spectroscopy for this purpose. Thus ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is demonstrated to be a useful tool for exploration of biomolecular variation at the cellular level and with further development, it could be used as part of a panel of cell-based assays to indicate when different results might be seen in environmental species compared with currently used cell lines.

234	28606119	Molecular epidemiology of Avian Rotaviruses Group A and D shed by different bird species in Nigeria.	Pauly M, Oni OO, Sausy A, Owoade AA, Adeyefa CAO, Muller CP, Hubschen JM, Snoeck CJ	Virol J	 2017 Jun 12;14(1):111	 doi: 101186/s12985-017-0778-5	BACKGROUND: Avian rotaviruses (RVs) cause gastrointestinal diseases of birds worldwide. However, prevalence, diversity, epidemiology and phylogeny of RVs remain largely under-investigated in Africa. METHODS: Fecal samples from 349 birds (158 symptomatic, 107 asymptomatic and 84 birds without recorded health status) were screened by reverse transcription PCR to detect RV groups A and D (RVA and RVD). Partial gene sequences of VP4, VP6, VP7 and NSP4 for RVA, and of VP6 and VP7 for RVD were obtained and analyzed to infer phylogenetic relationship. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were applied to identify factors potentially influencing virus shedding in chickens. RESULTS: A high prevalence of RVA (36.1%; 126/349) and RVD (31.8%; 111/349) shedding was revealed in birds. In chickens, RV shedding was age-dependent and highest RVD shedding rates were found in commercial farms. No negative health effect could be shown, and RVA and RVD shedding was significantly more likely in asymptomatic chickens: RVA/RVD were detected in 51.9/48.1% of the asymptomatic chickens, compared to 18.9/29.7% of the symptomatic chickens (p < 0.001/p = 0.01). First RVA sequences were obtained from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and guinea fowls (Numida meleagris). Phylogenetic analyses illustrated the high genetic diversity of RVA and RVD in Nigerian birds and suggested cross-species transmission of RVA, especially at live bird markets. Indeed, RVA strains highly similar to a recently published fox rotavirus (RVA/Fox-tc/ITA/288356/2011/G18P[17]) and distantly related to other avian RVs were detected in different bird species, including pigeons, ducks, guinea fowls, quails and chickens. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into epidemiology, diversity and classification of avian RVA and RVD in Nigeria. We show that cross-species transmission of host permissive RV strains occurs when different bird species are mixed.

Tierney KB, Welsh PO, Mills M, Nason S, Barreda DR, Paszkowski CA	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	 2017 Sep;143:336-343	 doi: 101016/jecoenv201704021 Epub 2017 Apr 25	Rather than migrating, mallard ducks may choose to overwinter in northern cities on open-water thermal refuges, such as municipal wastewater treatment ponds, which in Edmonton, Canada, stay >/=10 degrees C during frigid winter months. Refuging mallards spend appreciable time daily on these ponds and hydrate using secondary clarified municipal wastewater (SCEW). We aimed to determine if SCEW ingestion affected mallard health. To this end, we gavaged newly hatched mallards (domesticated Pekin strain) over their first month with SCEW, as well as water representing negative and positive controls (municipal tap water, and the primary active ingredient from birth control pills, 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), respectively). The gavage of SCEW did not affect mass of the body, liver, spleen or heart, but was associated with small increases in beak and wing chord length. In the positive control, EE2 gavage caused similar responses, but also increased tarsus and phallus length. The increases likely owed to the stimulatory effects of estrogenic substances on bone and phallus development. For the biotransformation enzyme CYP2H1, gene expression was numerically increased by both SCEW and EE2. In terms of behavior, SCEW and EE2 gavage reduced two infrequently detected behaviours, pecking and resting alone. Our results suggest that SCEW ingestion would be unlikely to cause any overt health effects in adults, but may evoke subtle, covert effects nevertheless.
236	28424047	Deciphering mechanisms underlying the genetic variation of general production and liver quality traits in the overfed mule duck by pQTL analyses.	Francois Y, Vignal A, Molette C, Marty-Gasset N, Davail S, Liaubet L, Marie-Etancelin C	Genet Sel Evol	 2017 Apr 19;49(1):38	 doi: 101186/s12711-017-0313-6	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse the mechanisms that underlie phenotypic quantitative trait loci (QTL) in overfed mule ducks by identifying co-localized proteomic QTL (pQTL). The QTL design consisted of three families of common ducks that were progeny-tested by using 294 male mule ducks. This population of common ducks was genotyped using a genetic map that included 334 genetic markers located across 28 APL chromosomes (APL for Anas platyrhynchos). Mule ducks were phenotyped for 49 traits related to growth, metabolism, overfeeding ability and meat and fatty liver quality, and 326 soluble fatty liver proteins were quantified. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six pQTL and 80 phenotypic QTL were detected at the 5% chromosome-wide significance threshold. The great majority of the identified pQTL were trans-acting and localized on a chromosome other than that carrying the coding gene. The most significant pQTL (1% genome-wide significance) were found for alpha-enolase on APL18 and fatty acid synthase on APL24. Some proteins were associated with numerous pQTL (for example, 17 and 14 pQTL were detected for alpha-enolase and apolipoprotein A1, respectively) and pQTL hotspots were observed on some chromosomes (APL18, 24, 25 and 29). We detected 66 co-localized phenotypic QTL and pQTL for which the significance of the two-trait QTL (2t-QTL) analysis was higher than that of the strongest QTL using a single-trait approach. Among these, 16 2t-QTL were pleiotropic. For example, on APL15, melting rate and abundance of two alpha-enolase spots appeared to be impacted by a single locus that is involved in the glycolytic process. On APLZ, we identified a pleiotropic QTL that modified both the blood level of glucose at the beginning of the force-feeding period and the concentration of glutamate dehydrogenase, which, in humans, is involved in increased glucose absorption by the liver when the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 gene is mutated. CONCLUSIONS: We identified pleiotropic loci that affect metabolic pathways linked to glycolysis or lipogenesis, and in the end to fatty liver quality. Further investigation, via transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches, is required to confirm the biomarkers that were found to impact the genetic variability of these phenotypic traits.
237	28423047	Impact of body condition on influenza A virus infection dynamics in mallards following a secondary exposure.	Dannemiller NG, Webb CT, Wilson KR, Bentler KT, Mooers NL, Ellis JW, Root JJ, Franklin AB, Shriner SA	PLoS One	 2017 Apr 19;12(4):e0175757	 doi: 101371/journalpone0175757 eCollection 2017	Migratory waterfowl are often viewed as vehicles for the global spread of influenza A viruses (IAVs), with mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) implicated as particularly important reservoir hosts. The physical demands and energetic costs of migration have been shown to influence birds' body condition; poorer body condition may suppress immune function and affect the course of IAV infection. Our study evaluated the impact of body condition on immune function and viral shedding dynamics in mallards naturally exposed to an H9 IAV, and then secondarily exposed to an H4N6 IAV. Mallards were divided into three treatment groups of 10 birds per group, with each bird's body condition manipulated as a function of body weight by restricting food availability to achieve either a -10%, -20%, or control body weight class. We found that mallards exhibit moderate heterosubtypic immunity against an H4N6 IAV infection after an infection from an H9 IAV, and that body condition did not have an impact on shedding dynamics in response to a secondary exposure. Furthermore, body condition did not affect aspects of the innate and adaptive immune system, including the acute phase protein haptoglobin, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios, and antibody production. Contrary to recently proposed hypotheses and some experimental evidence, our data do not support relationships between body condition, infection and immunocompetence following a second exposure to IAV in mallards. Consequently, while annual migration may be a driver in the maintenance and spread of IAVs, the energetic demands of migration may not affect susceptibility in mallards.
238	28411463	Simultaneous separation of taxon-specific crystallins from Mule duck and characterization of their enzymatic activities and structures.	Wang CH, Huang CC, Chen W	J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci	 2017 May 15;1053:34-41	 doi: 101016/jjchromb201702027 Epub 2017 Apr 6	Methods to obtain pure proteins in large amounts are indispensible in protein research. We report here a large-scale/simultaneous isolation of taxon-specific crystallins (varepsilon- and delta-crystallin) from the eye lenses of Mule duck. We also investigate the compositions, enzymatic activities, and structures of these purified taxon-specific proteins. A relatively mild method of ion-exchange chromatography was developed to fractionate varepsilon-crystallin and delta-crystallin in large amount, ca. approximately 6.60mg/g-lens and approximately 41.0mg/g-lens, respectively. Both crystallins were identified by electrophoresis, HPLC, and MALDI-TOF-MS. varepsilon-Crystallin, with native composition of Mr 142kDa, consisted of two subunits of 35kDa and 36kDa, while delta-Crystallin, with native molecular mass of 200kDa, comprised single subunit of Mr approximately 50kDa. Both varepsilon- and delta-crystallin were tetramers. The former showed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, while the latter appeared slightly active in an argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) assay. Raman spectroscopic results indicated that the secondary structures of varepsilon- and delta-crystallin were predominantly alpha-helix as evidenced by the vibrational stretching of amide III over 1260cm(-1) and amide I at 1255cm(-1), in greatly contrast to the anti-parallel beta-sheet of alpha- and beta-crystallin as demonstrated by amide III at 1238cm(-1) and amide I at 1672cm(-1). The microenvironments of aromatic amino acids and the status of thiol groups also vary in different crystallins. The compositions, enzyme activities, and structures of the varepsilon- and delta-crystalline of Mule duck are different from those of Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) or Kaiya duck (Anas Platyrhynchos var. domestica), which reflect faithfully species specificity.
239	28411303	Comparative approaches to same/different abstract-concept learning.	Wright AA, Kelly DM	Learn Behav	 2017 Dec;45(4):323-324	 doi: 103758/s13420-017-0271-4	Martinho and Kacelnik (2016) imprinted newly hatched ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) with a moving pair of either same or different objects, and following only one session, the ducklings accurately transferred the same/different relationship to novel object pairs that maintained the training relationship. This rapid learning and transfer of the concepts same and different far outstrips the more gradual learning of these basic concepts by animals in associative-learning tasks in which reinforcement is given for correct responses.

Jung KM, Kim YM, Ono T, Han JY	Mol Reprod Dev	 2017 Jun;84(6):508-516	 doi: 101002/mrd22802 Epub 2017 Apr 12	Primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of sperm or ova, could be used to generate transgenic animals and interspecies germ-line chimeras, which would facilitate the recovery of endangered species by making their access and manipulation in vitro easier. During early embryogenesis in avian species, PGCs are transported via the bloodstream to the gonadal anlagen. PGCs of most avian species-particularly wild or endangered birds-are not readily isolated from the embryonic bloodstream because germ-cell markers have not yet been defined for them. Here, we report a rapid, efficient, and convenient method for PGC isolation from various avian species. Blood PGCs were isolated based on the difference in size between PGCs and other blood cells, using a microporous membrane. The efficiency of this size-dependent isolation for the White Leghorn chicken was not significantly different from that of magnetic-activated cell sorting, and the isolated cells expressed chicken PGC-related genes and PGC-specific markers. The utility of the method was then verified in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata). Immunocytochemistry and an in vivo migration assay indicated that this method was able to enrich for true embryonic blood PGCs without specific antibodies, and could be applied to the development of avian interspecies chimeras for restoration of wild or endangered species.
241	28341929	Molecular characterisation of four echinostomes (Digenea: Echinostomatidae) from birds in New Zealand, with descriptions of Echinostoma novaezealandense n. sp. and Echinoparyphium poulini n. sp.	Georgieva S, Blasco-Costa I, Kostadinova A	Syst Parasitol	 2017 May;94(4):477-497	 doi: 101007/s11230-017-9712-x Epub 2017 Mar 24	Morphological and molecular characterisation of echinostome specimens (Digenea: Echinostomatidae) recovered in one Anas platyrhynchos L. and one Cygnus atratus (Latham) (Anseriformes: Anatidae) from New Zealand revealed the presence of two known species, Echinostoma miyagawai Ishii, 1932 and Echinoparyphium ellisi (Johnston & Simpson, 1944) and two species new to science. Comparative morphological and phylogenetic analyses supported the distinct species status of Echinostoma novaezealandense n. sp. ex Branta canadensis (L.), A. platyrhynchos and C. atratus, and Echinoparyphium poulini n. sp. ex C. atratus. Echinostoma novaezealandense n. sp., a species of the "revolutum" species complex characterised by the possession of a head collar armed with 37 spines, keyed down to E. revolutum but was distinguished from the latter in having a much narrower body with almost parallel margins, longer oesophagus, wider cirrus-sac, larger seminal vesicle, much smaller ventral sucker, ovary, Mehlis' gland and testes, more anteriorly located ovary and testes, and distinctly smaller eggs (81-87 x 42-53 vs 106-136 x 55-70 microm). This new species appears similar to Echinostoma acuticauda Nicoll, 1914 described in Australia but differs in having a longer forebody, more posteriorly located ovary and testes, and much smaller eggs (81-87 x 42-53 vs 112-126 x 63-75 microm). Echinoparyphium poulini n. sp. is differentiated from the four species of Echinoparyphium possessing 37 collar spines considered valid as follows: from E. chinensis Ku, Li & Chu, 1964 in having a much smaller body, four (vs five) angle spines and simple seminal vesicle (vs bipartite); from E. schulzi Matevosyan, 1951 in having a less robust body at a comparable body length, much smaller ventral sucker, ovary and testes, and longer but narrower eggs (87-109 x 50-59 vs 70-85 x 60-84 microm); and from the two smaller forms, E. serratum Howell, 1968 and E. aconiatum Dietz, 1909, in a number of additional metrical features correlated with body size and especially in the possession of much larger collar spines. Partial fragments of the mitochondrial nad1 and 28S rRNA genes were amplified for representative isolates of the four species and analysed together with sequences for Echinostoma spp. and Echinoparyphium spp. available on GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses based on the mitochondrial nad1 gene revealed congruence between the molecular data and species identification/delineation based on morphology; this was corroborated by the 28S rDNA sequence data.
242	28323070	Urbanization and the dynamics of RNA viruses in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wille M, Lindqvist K, Muradrasoli S, Olsen B, Jarhult JD	Infect Genet Evol	 2017 Jul;51:89-97	 doi: 101016/jmeegid201703019 Epub 2017 Mar 18	Urbanization is intensifying worldwide, and affects the epidemiology of infectious diseases. However, the effect of urbanization on natural host-pathogen systems remains poorly understood. Urban ducks occupy an interesting niche in that they directly interact with both humans and wild migratory birds, and either directly or indirectly with food production birds. Here we have collected samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) residing in a pond in central Uppsala, Sweden, from January 2013 to January 2014. This artificial pond is kept ice-free during the winter months, and is a popular location where the ducks are fed, resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round. Nine hundred and seventy seven (977) fecal samples were screened for RNA viruses including: influenza A virus (IAV), avian paramyxovirus 1, avian coronavirus (CoV), and avian astrovirus (AstroV). This intra-annual dataset illustrates that these RNA viruses exhibit similar annual patterns to IAV, suggesting similar ecological factors are at play. Furthermore, in comparison to wild ducks, autumnal prevalence of IAV and CoV are lower in this urban population. We also demonstrate that AstroV might be a larger burden to urban ducks than IAV, and should be better assessed to demonstrate the degree to which wild birds contribute to the epidemiology of these viruses. The presence of economically relevant viruses in urban Mallards highlights the importance of elucidating the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments, which will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife, food production animals, and humans.
243	28301233	Identification of Type A Influenza Viruses from Wild Birds on the Delmarva Peninsula, 2007-10.	Preskenis LA, Ladman BS, Gelb J Jr	Avian Dis	 2017 Mar;61(1):83-89	 doi: 101637/11461-062716-Reg	Wild waterfowl and shorebirds in the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia (Delmarva) Peninsula region within the Atlantic Flyway were sampled as part of the Early Detection of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza (AI) in Wild Migratory Birds program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and state wildlife agencies submitted 7858 samples for AI virus (AIV) testing by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) to the University of Delaware Poultry Health System from April 2007 to March 2011. Virus isolation attempts were performed on samples with matrix gene cycle threshold (Ct) values </=33.9. Using rRT-PCR, AIV was detected in 14% (1091/7857) of the samples. In species with sample sizes >100, American black duck ( Anas rubripes ; 28%), ruddy turnstone ( Arenaria interpres ; 27%), American green-winged teal ( Anas crecca ; 21%), semipalmated sandpiper ( Calidris pusilla ; 27%), greater snow goose ( Chen caerulescens atlanticus; 12%), mallard ( Anas platyrhynchos ; 10%), and northern pintail ( Anas acuta ; 14%) showed the highest rates of AIV detection. Forty-two AIVs were recovered from eight species: American black duck, mallard, ruddy turnstone, American green-winged teal, greater snow goose, Canada goose ( Branta canadensis ), ring-necked duck ( Aythya collaris ), and mallard x American black duck ( Anas platyrhynchos x Anas rubripes ). Recovered H5 (n = 2) and H7 (n = 2) viruses were found to be low pathogenicity by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory. Additional AIVs represented a diversity of subtype combinations: H1-H4, H6, and H10 and H11 and N subtypes N1-N9 and N6-N9. The rate of AIV recovery from swabbings was inversely related to Ct value, ranging from 50% for Ct values of 16.0-18.9 to 5.1% for Ct values of 31-33.9.
244	28278281	Discordant detection of avian influenza virus subtypes in time and space between poultry and wild birds; Towards improvement of surveillance programs.	Verhagen JH, Lexmond P, Vuong O, Schutten M, Guldemeester J, Osterhaus AD, Elbers AR, Slaterus R, Hornman M, Koch G, Fouchier RA	PLoS One	 2017 Mar 9;12(3):e0173470	 doi: 101371/journalpone0173470 eCollection 2017	Avian influenza viruses from wild birds can cause outbreaks in poultry, and occasionally infect humans upon exposure to infected poultry. Identification and characterization of viral reservoirs and transmission routes is important to develop strategies that prevent infection of poultry, and subsequently virus transmission between poultry holdings and to humans. Based on spatial, temporal and phylogenetic analyses of data generated as part of intense and large-scale influenza surveillance programs in wild birds and poultry in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2011, we demonstrate that LPAIV subtype distribution differed between wild birds and poultry, suggestive of host-range restrictions. LPAIV isolated from Dutch poultry were genetically most closely related to LPAIV isolated from wild birds in the Netherlands or occasionally elsewhere in Western Europe. However, a relatively long time interval was observed between the isolations of related viruses from wild birds and poultry. Spatial analyses provided evidence for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) being more abundant near primary infected poultry farms. Detailed year-round investigation of virus prevalence and wild bird species distribution and behavior near poultry farms should be used to improve risk assessment in relation to avian influenza virus introduction and retarget avian influenza surveillance programs.
245	28277035	Ultrastructural study of liver and lead tissue concentrations in young mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) after ingestion of single lead shot.	Pineau A, Fauconneau B, Plouzeau E, Fernandez B, Quellard N, Levillain P, Guillard O	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2017;80(3):188-195	 doi: 101080/1528739420171279093 Epub 2017 Feb 22	Lead (Pb) represents a serious threat to wildlife and ecosystems. The aim of this study was to examine the subcellular effects of dietary Pb pellet ingestion on mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) livers. After ingestion of a single Pb shot (LS4 size class: 0.177 +/- 0.03 g) in 41 mallard ducks (22 males and 19 females) versus 10 controls (5 males and 5 females), all 7-week old, a morphologic study was conducted by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) of liver at the subcellular level. The results in treated mallards showed at a magnification of 2500 X that hepatic parenchyma was altered as evidenced by intralysosomal electron-dense deposits, which are compatible with Pb deposits. Further, at a higher magnification (15,000 X) in both genders, deterioration of mitochondria was observed in which the crests and, to a lesser extent, outer membrane were lysed. While the rough endoplasmic reticulum was fragmented, intracytoplasmic electron-dense material compatible with Pb deposits was maximally visible, thereby underscoring the deeply destructive effect of this metal on the subcellular architecture of the liver. In addition, applying an optimized and validated method in a clean room using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometer (ETAAS) with Zeeman background correction, the objective was to improve and refine certain indispensable measurements pertaining to Pb impregnation in tissues other than liver such as kidneys, bones, and feathers of mallards. Data demonstrated show that compared with controls, Pb accumulation increases significantly, not only in the liver (3-fold), but also in the bones and the feathers (14-fold). No significant difference was noted between males and females. Bearing in mind the marked subcellular toxicity attributed to Pb, this study reinforces present-day arguments advocating limitation of game consumption.
246	28198082	PCK1 expression is correlated with the plasma glucose level in the duck.	Chen L, Zeng T, Li GQ, Liu R, Tian Y, Li QH, Lu LZ	Anim Genet	 2017 Jun;48(3):358-361	 doi: 101111/age12540 Epub 2017 Feb 15	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (soluble) (PCK1) is a key gene in gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis. Although its functions have been extensively studied in mice, bats and humans, little is known in ducks. Here, PCK1 functions were studied using a duck domestication model and a 48-h fasting experiment. We found PCK1 expression significantly decreased in two breeds of domestic ducks (Jinyun Pockmark ducks and Cherry Valley ducks) as compared with wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Simultaneously, plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides and free fatty acid in domestic ducks were lower than in wild ducks. When compared with fed ducks, the plasma triglyceride level was observed to be significantly decreased, while the glucose and free fatty acid levels remained constant in 48-h fasting ducks. The expression analysis of gluconeogenic genes revealed that fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase genes (FBP1 and FBP2) and the glucose-6-phosphatase gene (G6PC2) were not changed, whereas PCK1 was significantly upregulated. In addition, the reported regulators of PCK1, including forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) gene and orphan nuclear receptor NR4A family genes (NR4A1, NR4A2 and NR4A3), exhibited similar expression levels between 48-h fasting ducks and fed ducks, suggesting that PCK1 is not regulated by these genes in the duck under fasting conditions. In conclusion, PCK1 expression may affect plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides and free fatty acid during the duck domestication process. This work demonstrates for the first time in duck that PCK1 is a key gene in maintaining plasma glucose homeostasis during fasting and that the upregulated expression of PCK1 may be responsible for constant plasma free fatty acid level by the glyceroneogenesis process.
247	28174661	Movement patterns of a keystone waterbird species are highly predictable from landscape configuration.	Kleyheeg E, van Dijk JGB, Tsopoglou-Gkina D, Woud TY, Boonstra DK, Nolet BA, Soons MB	Mov Ecol	 2017 Feb 1;5:2	 doi: 101186/s40462-016-0092-7 eCollection 2017	BACKGROUND: Movement behaviour is fundamental to the ecology of animals and their interactions with other organisms, and as such contributes to ecosystem dynamics. Waterfowl are key players in ecological processes in wetlands and surrounding habitats through predator-prey interactions and their transportation of nutrients and other organisms. Understanding the drivers of their movement behaviour is crucial to predict how environmental changes affect their role in ecosystem functioning. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are the most abundant duck species worldwide and important dispersers of aquatic invertebrates, plants and pathogens like avian influenza viruses. By GPS tracking of 97 mallards in four landscape types along a gradient of wetland availability, we identified patterns in their daily movement behaviour and quantified potential effects of weather conditions and water availability on the spatial scale of their movements. RESULTS: We demonstrate that mallard movement patterns were highly predictable, with regular commuting flights at dusk and dawn between a fixed day roost and one or several fixed nocturnal foraging sites, linked strongly to surface water. Wind and precipitation hardly affected movement, but flight distances and home range sizes increased when temperatures dropped towards zero. Flight distances and home range sizes increased exponentially with decreasing availability of freshwater habitat. Total shoreline length and the number of water bodies in the landscape surrounding the roost were the best predictors of the spatial scale of daily mallard movements. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show how mallards may flexibly adjust the spatial scale of their movements to wetland availability in the landscape. This implies that mallards moving between discrete habitat patches continue to preserve biotic connectivity in increasingly fragmented landscapes. The high predictability of mallard movement behaviour in relation to landscape features makes them reliable dispersal vectors for organisms to adapt to, and allows prediction of their ecological role in other landscapes.

Abedinia A, Ariffin F, Huda N, Nafchi AM	Int J Biol Macromol	 2017 May;98:586-594	 doi: 101016/jijbiomac201701139 Epub 2017 Feb 4	The effects of different pretreatments on yield and composition of extraction, physicochemical, and rheological properties of duck feet gelatin (DFG) were investigated. Gelatins were extracted from the whole feet of Pekin duck with an average yield of 4.09%, 3.65%, and 5.75% for acidic (Ac-DFG), alkaline (Al-DFG), and enzymatic (En-DFG) pretreatment on a wet weight basis, respectively. Proteins at 81.38%, 79.41%, 82.55%, and 87.38% were the major composition for Ac-DFG, Al-DFG, En-DFG, and bovine, respectively. Amino acid analysis showed glycine as the predominant amino acid in Ac-DFG, followed by hydroxyproline, proline, and alanine for Ac-DFG, Al-DFG, and En-DFG, respectively. Rheological analysis indicated that the maximum elastic modulus (9972.25Pa) and loss modulus (4956.28Pa) for Ac-DFG gelatin were significantly higher than those of other gelatins. Extracted gelatins contained alpha1 and alpha2 chains as the predominant components, and enzymatic gelatin had low molecular weight peptides. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the peak of the gelatins was mainly positioned in the amide band region (amides I, II, and III). A considerable loss of molecular-order triple helical structure was also observed after pepsin treatment. In summary, duck feet gelatin has potential to replace as mammalian gelatin in food and pharmaceutical industry.
249	28170210	The parasites of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) as an indicator of health status and quality of the environment	Sokol R, Ras-Norynska MA, Gesek MA, Murawska D, Hanzal V, Janiszewski PE	Ann Parasitol	 2016;62(4):351-353	 doi: 1017420/ap620473	The mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) is a host to internal and external parasites. A heavy parasite burden indicates poor immunological status and a pathogen-contaminated environment. The present study describes the macroscopic and microscopic examination of isolated intestines and gizzards of 130 mallard ducks from birds kept in the breeding farm. Scrapings of intestinal mucosa were examined by flotation and with the sedimentation method. The results of the flotation method indicate the presence of coccidia oocysts in the ileum scrapings from one of five male mallards aged six weeks, one out of five aged 10 weeks and three out of five aged 12 weeks. In female mallards, oocysts were found in two of five birds aged 12 weeks and in two of five aged 16 weeks. No macroscopic lesions were found in the intestinal mucosa. Adult forms of the nematode Amidostomum anseris were found in the gizzards of six mallards aged 20 weeks and in two aged 22 weeks. The relatively low prevalence of parasitic infections reflects the purity of the environment, good immunity status of the birds and good management of the farm.
250	28116946	Mitochondrial D-loop analysis for uncovering the population structure and genetic diversity among the indigenous duck (Anas platyrhynchos) populations of India.	Gaur U, Tantia MS, Mishra B, Bharani Kumar ST, Vijh RK, Chaudhury A	Mitochondrial DNA A DNA Mapp Seq Anal	 2018 Mar;29(2):212-219	 doi: 101080/2470139420161267158 Epub 2017 Jan 24	The indigenous domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) which is domesticated from Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) contributes significantly to poor farming community in coastal and North Eastern regions of India. For conservation and maintenance of indigenous duck populations it is very important to know the existing genetic diversity and population structure. To unravel the population structure and genetic diversity among the five indigenous duck populations of India, the mitochondrial D-loop sequences of 120 ducks were analyzed. The sequence analysis by comparison of mtDNA D-loop region (470 bp) of five Indian duck populations revealed 25 mitochondrial haplotypes. Pairwise FST value among populations was 0.4243 (p < .01) and the range of nucleotide substitution per site (Dxy) between the five Indian duck populations was 0.00034-0.00555, and the net divergence (Da) was 0-0.00355. The phylogenetic analysis in the present study unveiled three clades. The analysis revealed genetic continuity among ducks of coastal region of the country which formed a separate group from the ducks of the inland area. Both coastal as well as the land birds revealed introgression of the out group breed Khaki Campbell, which is used for breed improvement programs in India. The observations revealed very less selection and a single matrilineal lineage of indigenous domestic ducks.

Henry-Guyot E, Langlois I, Lanthier I, Acvp D	J Avian Med Surg	 2016 Dec;30(4):364-367	 doi: 101647/2015-124	A 5-year-old, 3.72-kg female Pekin duck ( Anas platyrhynchos domestica) was presented for acute respiratory distress, head shaking, and collapse. Similar spontaneously resolving episodes had previously occurred. Physical examination revealed severe inspiratory and expiratory dyspnea. Due to poor prognosis, euthanasia was elected. Postmortem examination revealed severe tracheal collapse involving the proximal trachea. The tracheal lumen was reduced in size by 75%. Histologic evaluation revealed ossification of the tracheal rings for approximately 60%-100% of their circumference. The bone trabecules presented characteristics of mature bone with a medullar cavity containing hematopoietic cells and adipocytes. There was also osseous metaplasia of the cartilage. In the lamina propria, there was lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis, both moderate. To our knowledge, tracheal collapse has not been reported in a Pekin Duck.

Swieton E, Wyrostek K, Jozwiak M, Olszewska-Tomczyk M, Domanska-Blicharz K, Meissner W, Wlodarczyk R, Minias P, Janiszewski T, Minta Z, Smietanka K	J Wildl Dis	 2017 Apr;53(2):330-338	 doi: 107589/2016-07-154 Epub 2017 Jan 17	We tested wild birds in Poland during 2008-15 for avian influenza virus (AIV). We took 10,312 swabs and feces samples from 6,314 live birds representing 12 orders and 84 bird species, mostly from orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, for testing and characterization by various PCR methods. From PCR-positive samples, we attempted to isolate and subtype the virus. The RNA of AIV was detected in 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.1%) of birds represented by 48 Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ), 11 Mute Swans ( Cygnus olor ), 48 Common Teals ( Anas crecca ), three Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), one Common Coot ( Fulica atra ), one Garganey (Spatula querquedula), and one unidentified bird species. Overall, the prevalence of AIV detection in Mallards and Mute Swans (the most frequently sampled species) was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4-2.5%) and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2-0.8%), respectively; the difference was statistically significant (P=0.000). Hemagglutinin subtypes from H1 to H13 were identified, including H5 and H7 low pathogenic AIV subtypes. Mallards and Common Teals harbored the greatest diversity of subtypes. We observed seasonality of viral detection in Mallards, with higher AIV prevalence in late summer and autumn than in winter and spring. In addition, two peaks in AIV prevalence in summer (August) and autumn (November) were demonstrated for Mallards. The prevalence of AIV in Mute Swans did not show any statistically significant seasonal patterns.
253	27997047	No evidence for homosubtypic immunity of influenza H3 in Mallards following vaccination in a natural experimental system.	Wille M, Latorre-Margalef N, Tolf C, Stallknecht DE, Waldenstrom J	Mol Ecol	 2017 Mar;26(5):1420-1431	 doi: 101111/mec13967 Epub 2017 Feb 6	The Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is an important reservoir species for influenza A viruses (IAV), and in this host, prevalence and virus diversity are high. Studies have demonstrated the presence of homosubtypic immunity, where individuals are unlikely to be reinfected with the same subtype within an autumn season. Further, evidence for heterosubtypic immunity exists, whereby immune responses specific for one subtype offer partial or complete protection against related HA subtypes. We utilized a natural experimental system to determine whether homo- or heterospecific immunity could be induced following experimental vaccination. Thirty Mallards were vaccinated with an inactivated H3, H6 or a sham vaccine and after seroconversion were exposed to naturally infected wild conspecifics. All ducks were infected within 2 days and had both primary and secondary infections. Overall, there was no observable difference between groups; all individuals were infected with H3 and H10 IAV. At the cessation of the experiment, most individuals had anti-NP antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against H10. Not all individuals had H3 neutralizing antibodies. The isolated H3 IAVs revealed genetic dissimilarity to the H3 vaccine strain, specifically substitutions in the vicinity of the receptor-binding site. There was no evidence of vaccine-induced homosubtypic immunity to H3, a likely result of both a poor H3 immune response in the ducks and H3 immune escape. Likewise, there was no observed heterosubtypic protection related to H6 vaccination. This study highlights the need for experimental approaches to assess how exposure to pathogens and resulting immune processes translates to individual and population disease dynamics.
254	27995135	TRIM25 Identification in the Chinese Goose: Gene Structure, Tissue Expression Profiles, and Antiviral Immune Responses In Vivo and In Vitro.	Wei Y, Zhou H, Wang A, Sun L, Wang M, Jia R, Zhu D, Liu M, Yang Q, Wu Y, Sun K, Chen X, Cheng A, Chen S	Biomed Res Int	 2016;2016:1403984	 doi: 101155/2016/1403984 Epub 2016 Nov 22	The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein play a critical role in the interferon (IFN) response during RNA virus infection. The tripartite motif containing 25 proteins (TRIM25) was reported to modify caspase activation and RIG-I recruitment domains (CARDs) via ubiquitin. These modifications allow TRIM25 to interact with mitochondrial antiviral signaling molecules (MAVs) and form CARD-CARD tetramers. Goose TRIM25 was cloned from gosling lungs, which possess a 1662 bp open reading flame (ORF). This ORF encodes a predicted 554 amino acid protein consisting of a B-box domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a PRY/SPRY domain. The protein sequence has 89.25% sequence identity with Anas platyrhynchos TRIM25, 78.57% with Gallus gallus TRIM25, and 46.92% with Homo sapiens TRIM25. TRIM25 is expressed in all gosling and adult goose tissues examined. QRT-PCR revealed that goose TRIM25 transcription could be induced by goose IFN-alpha, goose IFN-gamma, and goose IFN-lambda, as well as a35 s polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), oligodeoxynucleotides 2006 (ODN 2006), and resiquimod (R848) in vitro; however, it is inhibited in H9N2 infected goslings for unknown reasons. These data suggest that goose TRIM25 might play a positive role in the regulation of the antiviral immune response.
255	27964989	Heavy metals in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos from eastern Austria.	Plessl C, Jandrisits P, Krachler R, Keppler BK, Jirsa F	Sci Total Environ	 2017 Feb 15;580:670-676	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv201612013 Epub 2016 Dec 10	A total of 77 specimens of the mallard Anas platyrhynchos were sampled from the eastern part of Austria before the ban on lead gun shot for hunting water fowl. Samples of muscle and liver were analyzed for their content of Cr, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd, Hg and Pb using atomic absorption spectrometry. In addition the Hg content of feather samples from this aquatic bird species was evaluated. Results generally show higher concentrations of the metals in the liver compared to muscle; for mercury the concentrations were feathers>liver>muscle. Elevated, in some cases critical concentrations of Cr, Cu, Cd, Hg and Pb were measured. Levels of Ag were recorded for the first time for this species from Europe, providing basic information for future evaluation of this upcoming pollutant in aquatic environments.
256	27921292	Cranial joint histology in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos): new insights on avian cranial kinesis.	Bailleul AM, Witmer LM, Holliday CM	J Anat	 2017 Mar;230(3):444-460	 doi: 101111/joa12562 Epub 2016 Dec 6	The evolution of avian cranial kinesis is a phenomenon in part responsible for the remarkable diversity of avian feeding adaptations observable today. Although osteological, developmental and behavioral features of the feeding system are frequently studied, comparatively little is known about cranial joint skeletal tissue composition and morphology from a microscopic perspective. These data are key to understanding the developmental, biomechanical and evolutionary underpinnings of kinesis. Therefore, here we investigated joint microstructure in juvenile and adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos; Anseriformes). Ducks belong to a diverse clade of galloanseriform birds, have derived adaptations for herbivory and kinesis, and are model organisms in developmental biology. Thus, new insights into their cranial functional morphology will refine our understanding of avian cranial evolution. A total of five specimens (two ducklings and three adults) were histologically sampled, and two additional specimens (a duckling and an adult) were subjected to micro-computed tomographic scanning. Five intracranial joints were sampled: the jaw joint (quadrate-articular); otic joint (quadrate-squamosal); palatobasal joint (parasphenoid-pterygoid); the mandibular symphysis (dentary-dentary); and the craniofacial hinge (a complex flexion zone involving four different pairs of skeletal elements). In both the ducklings and adults, the jaw, otic and palatobasal joints are all synovial, with a synovial cavity and articular cartilage on each surface (i.e. bichondral joints) ensheathed in a fibrous capsule. The craniofacial hinge begins as an ensemble of patent sutures in the duckling, but in the adult it becomes more complex: laterally it is synovial; whereas medially, it is synostosed by a bridge of chondroid bone. We hypothesize that it is chondroid bone that provides some of the flexible properties of this joint. The heavily innervated mandibular symphysis is already fused in the ducklings and remains as such in the adult. The results of this study will serve as reference for documenting avian cranial kinesis from a microanatomical perspective. The formation of: (i) secondary articular cartilage on the membrane bones of extant birds; and (ii) their unique ability to form movable synovial joints within two or more membrane bones (i.e. within their dermatocranium) might have played a role in the origin and evolution of modern avian cranial kinesis during dinosaur evolution.
257	27904021	Scanning electron microscopic study on the tongues of seven avian species.	Emura S	Okajimas Folia Anat Jpn	 2016;93(2):41-51	 doi: 102535/ofaj9341	The dorsal lingual surface of the grey crowned crane (Balearica regulorum), American flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), great egret (Ardea alba), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus), black-necked stilt (himantopus mexicanus) and green macaw (Ara militaris) were examined by scanning electron microscopy. In the grey crowned crane, the surface of the lingual apex was relatively rough. Many openings of the lingual glands in both lateral regions of the lingual body were observed. The surfaces of many conical papillae were smooth. Many openings of the lingual glands were observed in the region of the lingual root. In the American flamingo, the surface of the lingual apex was relatively smooth. The surfaces of many fang-like and mustache-like structures were smooth. In the great egret, the surfaces of the lingual apex, central part of the posterior lingual body and giant conical papilla were relatively smooth. Many openings of the lingual glands were observed on the lingual root. In the mallard, the surface of the lingual apex was relatively smooth. The thread-shaped and scale-shaped structures were observed on the anterolateral region of the lingual body. The saw-shaped papillae on the posterolateral region of the lingual body consisted of the thread-shaped structure and big processes. In the Himalayan monal, the dorsal surfaces of the lingual apex and body were relatively smooth. The posterior part of the lingual body consisted of several conical papillae. Many openings of the lingual glands were observed on the lingual root. In the black-necked stilt, the surface of the lingual apex was relatively smooth. The dorsal surface of the lingual body was rough to comparison with that of the lingual apex. The posterior part of the lingual body consisted of several conical papillae. In the green macaw, the surface of the lingual apex had many grooves. The posterior part of the lingual body consisted of several conical papillae. These findings indicate a close correlation between the shape of the tongue and the method of food intake, the type of food, and bird's habitat.
258	27844479	Specific expression and promoter analysis of the albumin gene promoter of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Chen Y, Yu Q, Huang Z, Wang B, Xu Q, Lan L, Chang G, Zhang Y, Chen G	Br Poult Sci	 2017 Feb;58(1):19-25	 doi: 101080/0007166820161236361 Epub 2017 Jan 10	1. Albumin (ALB) is a serum protein most highly expressed in liver and regarded as an effective indicator for liver pathologies. The objectives of this study were to determine the expression of duck ALB gene (duALB) in various non-hepatic tissues and identify the potential cis-regulatory elements in the promoter. 2. A model was established to assess duALB promoter activity in different cell lines by construction of a duALB promoter-driven GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein)-expressing vector, which exhibited high expression activity in liver-derived cells and lower expression in other cells. Through the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by a series of constructs carrying progressive deletions, the core transcriptional regulatory region within the duALB promoter was identified. Mutations in candidate-binding sites were made by site-directed mutagenesis. 3. The core transcriptional regulatory region was located in the -190/-51 bp region. This region contains three potential transcription factor-binding sites, one each for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-3beta) (-158/-149), CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein element (C/EBPalpha) (-119/-107) and nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) (-67/-57). Site-directed mutagenesis of HNF-1 and C/EBPalpha-binding sites resulted in a significant reduction in duALB promoter activity. Two potential cis-regulatory elements (C/EBPalpha and HNF-1) were responsible for its transcriptional activity in liver-derived cells. 4. These findings contribute to the further understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of ALB gene regulation and the use of tissue-specific gene promoters to regulate tissue-specific expression of exogenous genes in vivo.
259	27836493	Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and wastewater ponds, Part I: Mallard ducks overwintering at a northern wastewater treatment pond.	Welsh PO, Paszkowski CA, Tierney KB	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	 2017 Sep;143:330-335	 doi: 101016/jecoenv201610038 Epub 2016 Nov 8	In northern urban areas, wastewater treatment ponds (WWTPs) may provide a thermal refuge during winter (~10 degrees C) that is used by normally migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). On the ponds, mallards may experience stress due to crowding, or through the ingestion of WWTP water, be exposed to a diverse array of synthetic chemicals, which may have adverse health effects. Photographic sampling was used to assess mallard sex ratios and behavioural patterns throughout the late winter on wastewater ponds in Edmonton, Canada. The WWTP mallard population was large (>1000 birds), but temporally variable and consistently male-dominated. Locomotion and dabbling were the primary behaviors observed; aggression was rarely observed, which suggests crowding stress was low or absent. Mallard abundance tended to be higher at lower air temperatures, suggesting that WWTP ponds acted as a thermal refuge. Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen from duck feces and potential food sources indicated that mallards were not feeding at the site, or on invertebrates or select waste grain from offsite. Rather, ducks either consumed an undetermined food source or were feeding very little. Taken together, the data suggest that winter use of northern WWTP ponds may serve as an alternative to migration, whether this strategy benefits or harms mallards likely depends on winter severity, and not on WWTP pond characteristics or water quality.

Rocchigiani G, Poli A, Nardoni S, Papini R, Mancianti F	J Parasitol	 2017 Feb;103(1):142-145	 doi: 101645/16-34 Epub 2016 Nov 2	Thirty-five adult waterfowl (14 males and 21 females) representing various orders and species were sampled during the hunting season from 2015 to 2016. Antibodies to Neospora caninum were detected by IFAT on blood samples, while heart and brain were subjected to molecular analysis for the detection of Neospora caninum DNA. Twelve birds (34.3%) (6 Anas crecca , 3 Anas platyrhynchos , 2 Anas penelope , 1 Anas acuta ) showed antibodies versus N. caninum , while 10 animals out of 35 (4 A. crecca , 2 A. platyrhynchos , 2 A. penelope , 1 A. acuta , and 1 Vanellus vanellus ) scored positive for at least 1 DNA sample, with an overall prevalence of 28.6%. The present report shows for the first time the occurrence of antibodies and N. caninum DNA in waterfowl. The avian species investigated in the present report, which feed directly from the soil and/or water, would be able to ingest oocysts excreted by final canid hosts and could contribute to parasite transmission in the sylvatic cycle. To achieve a definitive result about the role of these avian species in the epidemiology of this protozoan, the presence of viable parasites should be demonstrated by bioassay and/or culture, as well as histological evidence of N. caninum cysts in avian tissues.
261	27373315	Riemerella anatipestifer infection in domestic ducks in Japan, 2014.	Chikuba T, Uehara H, Fumikura S, Takahashi K, Suzuki Y, Hoshinoo K, Yamamoto Y	J Vet Med Sci	 2016 Nov 1;78(10):1635-1638	 doi: 101292/jvms16-0278 Epub 2016 Jul 2	The outbreak of Riemerella anatipestifer (RA) infection has been confirmed in meat-type domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) for the first time in 27 years in Japan. In January 2014, increased mortality in a 14- to 21-day-old duck flock was reported to veterinary officials by the owner. The affected ducks exhibited reduced movement, ataxia and dorsal recumbency with leg paddling. Pathological findings were typical for an RA infection. Fibrinous and heterophilic pericarditis, airsacculitis, perihepatitis, ventriculitis and meningitis were observed. The bacterial isolate from duck organs was identified as RA by PCR-based 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing.
262	27004808	Genetic Diversity and Phylogenetic Analysis of South-East Asian Duck Populations Based on the mtDNA D-loop Sequences.	Sultana H, Seo DW, Bhuiyan MS, Choi NR, Hoque MR, Heo KN, Lee JH	Asian-Australas J Anim Sci	 2016 Dec;29(12):1688-1695	 doi: 105713/ajas151017 Epub 2016 Mar 22	The maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region is widely used for exploring genetic relationships and for investigating the origin of various animal species. Currently, domestic ducks play an important role in animal protein supply. In this study, partial mtDNA D-loop sequences were obtained from 145 samples belonging to six South-East Asian duck populations and commercial duck population. All these populations were closely related to the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), as indicated by their mean overall genetic distance. Sixteen nucleotide substitutions were identified in sequence analyses allowing the distinction of 28 haplotypes. Around 42.76% of the duck sequences were classified as Hap_02, which completely matched with Anas platyrhynchos duck species. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also revealed that South-East Asian duck populations were closely related to Anas platyrhynchos. Network profiles were also traced using the 28 haplotypes. Overall, results showed that those duck populations D-loop haplotypes were shared between several duck breeds from Korea and Bangladesh sub continental regions. Therefore, these results confirmed that South-East Asian domestic duck populations have been domesticated from Anas platyrhynchos duck as the maternal origins.
263	27736234	Removal of a Presumed Peripheral Cerebral Cyst via Craniectomy in a Crested Pekin Duck ( Anas platyrhynchos f dom).	Yaw TJ, Jeffery ND, Cain B, Fales-Williams A, Zaffarano BA	J Avian Med Surg	 2016 Sep;30(3):263-268	 doi: 101647/2015-099	A juvenile, male crested pekin duck ( Anas platyrhynchos f dom) was presented for neurologic signs suggestive of cerebellar disease. Physical examination revealed microphthalmia, erratic head movements, and ataxia. Computed tomography scan of the head and neck regions revealed 2 full-thickness skull-bone defects within the caudal portion of the cranium. The cerebellum appeared to be ventrally compressed by a homogeneous, triangular, fluid-attenuating region (0-10 Hounsfield units). A craniectomy was performed, and a presumed peripheral cerebral cyst was removed with suction and gentle dissection. No postoperative complications occurred, and the patient showed clinical improvement for 5 months after surgery. However, after 5 months, the owners elected euthanasia because of poor prognosis after finding the duck minimally responsive in a water enclosure. At necropsy, a thin-walled, epithelial structure was present in meninges and was adhered to the skull at the presumed surgical site.
264	27733236	Risk of resistant avian influenza A virus in wild waterfowl as a result of environmental release of oseltamivir.	Gillman A	Infect Ecol Epidemiol	 2016 Oct 11;6:32870	 doi: 103402/ieev632870 eCollection 2016	Oseltamivir is the best available anti-influenza drug and has therefore been stockpiled worldwide in large quantities as part of influenza pandemic preparedness planning. The active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) is stable and is not removed by conventional sewage treatment. Active OC has been detected in river water at concentrations up to 0.86 microg/L. Although the natural reservoir hosts of influenza A virus (IAV) are wild waterfowl that reside in aquatic environments, the ecologic risks associated with environmental OC release and its potential to generate resistant viral variants among wild birds has largely been unknown. However, in recent years a number of in vivo mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) studies have been conducted regarding the potential of avian IAVs to become resistant to OC in natural reservoir birds if these are drug exposed. Development of resistance to OC was observed both in Group 1 (N1) and Group 2 (N2, N9) neuraminidase subtypes, when infected ducks were exposed to OC at concentrations between 0.95 and 12 microg/L in their water. All resistant variants maintained replication and transmission between ducks during drug exposure. In an A(H1N1)/H274Y virus, the OC resistance mutation persisted without selective drug pressure, demonstrating the potential of an IAV with a permissive genetic background to acquire and maintain OC resistance, potentially allowing circulation of the resistant variant among wild birds. The experimental studies have improved the appreciation of the risks associated with the environmental release of OC related to resistance development of avian IAVs among wild birds. Combined with knowledge of efficient methods for improved sewage treatment, the observations warrant implementation of novel efficient wastewater treatment methods, rational use of anti-influenza drugs, and improved surveillance of IAV resistance in wild birds.
265	27726904	Nonylphenol reduces sperm viability and fertility of mature male breeders in Brown Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Cheng MC, Chiang HI, Liao JW, Hung CM, Tsai MY, Chen YH, Ju JC, Cheng MP, Tso KH, Fan YK	Anim Reprod Sci	 2016 Nov;174:114-122	 doi: 101016/janireprosci201609014 Epub 2016 Sep 27	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nonylphenol (NP), a widely used surfactant, on the reproductive performance of male Brown Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) (MBBTDs). Mature MBBTDs (n=100) were treated with NP by daily gavaging of 0, 1 (NP1), 10 (NP10) and 250 (NP250) mg/kg-BW/d for 14 wk. Semen quality, fertilization rate and specific factors in blood plasma were measured. Weights of organs were also measured at 14 wk after NP administration. Ducks from each treatment (n=4) were continually treated with NP thereafter for 12 mo to observe changes of tissue ultrastructure by microscopic examination. The results showed that ducks treated with amounts of NP of greater than 1mg NP/kg BW/d (NP1) for 14 wk had decreased sperm viability (32.3%) compared to those in the control group (74.1%, P<0.05). The fertilization rate of ducks treated with 250mg NP/kg-BW/d (NP250) for 14 wk was reduced (21.0%) compared to the control group (74.5%, P<0.05). Plasma aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities were also greater in NP250 group at the 14th wk post-treatment. Plasma testosterone concentrations were increased by NP1 treatment at the 14th wk post-treatment. Administration at dosage 250mg NP/kg-BW/d for 12 mo resulted in reduced sperm counts (P<0.05) and histopathological changes, such as dilated seminiferous tubules (P<0.05) and degenerated spermatocytes (P<0.05). These findings strongly suggest that NP adversely affects the reproductive performance of MBBTDs.
266	27702920	Effects of betaine on biological functions in meat-type ducks exposed to heat stress.	Park SO, Kim WK	Poult Sci	 2017 May 1;96(5):1212-1218	 doi: 103382/ps/pew359	Heat stress in hot seasons is a major problem in poultry production, particularly in humid areas. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacodynamics of betaine on the blood and cecal short chain fatty acid profile in meat-type ducks exposed to heat stress. Three-hundred-sixty meat-type ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were randomly allocated into 4 treatments: C (heat stress control without betaine), T1 (700 ppm betaine), T2 (1,000 ppm betaine), and T3 (1,300 ppm betaine). Each treatment had 6 replicated pens with 15 meat-type ducks per pen. The study was conducted for 42 days. Our findings revealed that the betaine group had higher body weight gain compared to the control group under heat stress (P < 0.05). Betaine supplementation resulted in more significant improvement in hematological indicators such as RBCs and platelet counts than the heat stress control group (P < 0.05). Under the heat-wave environment, supplementation of betaine manifested a significant decrease in blood pH (P < 0.05) but not in electrolytes (Na+, K+ and Cl-) and gas concentration. The concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the cecum was higher than the control under heat stress conditions. The total SCFA, acetic acid, and propionic acid production was higher in the betaine supplemented groups compared to the heat stress control group (P < 0.05). Results showed that betaine supplementation has beneficial effects in meat-type ducks under heat stress on short chain fatty acid levels, blood biochemical parameters, and body weight.
267	27695931	Modulation of digestive enzyme activities in the avian digestive tract in relation to diet composition and quality.	Kohl KD, Ciminari ME, Chediack JG, Leafloor JO, Karasov WH, McWilliams SR, Caviedes-Vidal E	J Comp Physiol B	 2017 Feb;187(2):339-351	 doi: 101007/s00360-016-1037-6 Epub 2016 Oct 1	In nature, birds are faced with variable food sources that may differ in composition (protein vs. carbohydrates) and quality (highly digestible material vs. indigestible fiber). Studies in passerine birds and some commercial poultry demonstrate that the gastrointestinal tract can respond to varying diet composition and quality by changing morphology and/or activities of digestive enzymes. However, studies in additional avian species are warranted to understand generalities of these trends. We first fed juvenile mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), chickens (Gallus gallus), and quails (Coturnix coturnix) on either high-carbohydrate or high-protein diets. For the most part, birds fed the high-carbohydrate diet had higher small intestinal and cecal disaccharidase activities (maltase and sucrase). However, only mallards exhibited higher small intestinal aminopeptidase-N (APN) activities when fed the high-protein diet. These results differ from passerine birds, which largely modulate small intestinal proteases, but not disaccharidases. In another trial, we fed Canada geese (Branta canadensis) diets that varied in both their protein and fiber concentrations for approximately 3.5 months. Birds fed the high-fiber diets had significantly longer small intestines and caeca compared to those fed low-fiber diets. Additionally, geese fed the high-fiber diets exhibited lower mass-specific activities of small intestinal sucrase, and higher activities of APN when summed across the small intestine and ceca. Similar to the avian species above, geese fed the high-protein diets did not exhibit flexibility in their small intestinal APN activities. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that responsiveness of the avian digestive tract to diet composition may have phylogenetic or ecological constraints. Studies on other avian taxa are needed to understand these patterns.
268	27667676	Presence of plastic particles in waterbirds faeces collected in Spanish lakes.	Gil-Delgado JA, Guijarro D, Gosalvez RU, Lopez-Iborra GM, Ponz A, Velasco A	Environ Pollut	 2017 Jan;220(Pt A):732-736	 doi: 101016/jenvpol201609054 Epub 2016 Sep 22	Plastic intake by marine vertebrates has been widely reported, but information about its presence in continental waterfowl is scarce. Here we analyzed faeces of waterbirds species (European coot, Fulica atra, mallard, Anas platyrhynchos and shelduck, Tadorna tadorna) for plastic debris in five wetlands in Central Spain. We collected 89 faeces of shelduck distributed in four lakes, 43.8% of them presented plastic remnants. Sixty percent of 10 faeces of European coot and 45% of 40 faeces of mallard contained plastic debris. Plastic debris found was of two types, threads and fragments, and were identified as remnants of plastic objects used in agricultural fields surrounding the lakes. Differences in prevalence of plastic in faeces, number of plastic pieces per excrement and size of the plastic pieces were not statistically significant between waterfowl species. Thus, our results suggest that plastic may also be frequently ingested by waterfowl in continental waters, at least in our study area. Future studies should address this potential problem for waterbird conservation in other wetlands to evaluate the real impact of this pollutant on waterbirds living in inland water.
269	27651095	The Presence of Mercury in the Tissues of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos L.) from Wloclawek Reservoir in Poland.	Zarski JF, Skibniewski M, Skibniewska E, Zarski TP, Majdecka T	Biol Trace Elem Res	 2017 Apr;176(2):384-390	 doi: 101007/s12011-016-0845-6 Epub 2016 Sep 21	The study aimed at determining the degree of mercury contamination of mallards, game waterbirds migrating from the regions of the unknown degree of contamination and establishing whether the consumption of their meat comprises a hazard to human health in view of the binding norms concerning the mercury content in food products. The investigations were carried out on 30 mallards shot during the duck shooting season in which mercury concentrations in the muscles, liver, and kidneys were determined using the cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) method. The mean Hg concentration in the investigated tissues in all birds studied amounted to 0.110, 0.154, and 0.122 mg kg(-1) for the muscles, kidneys, and liver, respectively. The study indicated statistically significant (p </= 0.01) positive correlation between all of the organs examined. Animals were divided into two groups differing in both absolute values of Hg concentrations and those measured in individual tissues. In particular organs of birds representing the first group, the presence of highly significant correlation (p </= 0.01) was observed in all organs examined. In the second group, highly significant positive correlation between Hg concentrations in the liver and kidneys and highly significant negative dependence between the liver and muscles was noted. The examinations revealed that some birds must have come from regions of a high degree of mercury contamination.
270	27638121	Serological evidence of widespread West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus infection in native domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var domesticus) in Kuttanad region, Kerala, India.	Kalaiyarasu S, Mishra N, Khetan RK, Singh VP	Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis	 2016 Oct;48:61-8	 doi: 101016/jcimid201608002 Epub 2016 Aug 11	Birds can act as reservoirs of West Nile virus (WNV) with a key role in its epidemiology. WNV lineage 1 associated fatal cases of human encephalitis in 2011 and acute flaccid paralysis in 2013 were reported in Alappuzha district, Kerala, India. But no information is available on WNV circulation in domestic ducks, which are abundant, cohabit with humans and occupy wetlands and water bodies in the region. To determine the extent of WNV infection, we investigated 209 sera, 250 oral and 350 cloacal swab samples from local Chara and Chemballi domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var domesticus) in the districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kollam and Pathanamthitta collected during January and March 2015. The serum samples were tested for WNV antibodies first by a competition ELISA and then by a micro virus neutralization test (micro-VNT), while oral and cloacal swabs were subjected to WNV real-time RT-PCR. Ninety five ducks showed evidence of flavivirus antibodies by ELISA. End point neutralizing antibody titre against WNV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) revealed WNV specific antibodies in 24 (11.5%) ducks in 3 districts, JEV specific antibodies in 21 (10%) ducks in 2 districts and flavivirus specific antibodies in 19 (9%) ducks. However, no WNV genomic RNA could be detected. The results of this study demonstrate evidence of widespread WNV and JEV infection in domestic ducks in Kuttanad region, Kerala with a higher seroprevalence to WNV than JEV. Additionally, it highlights the utility of domestic ducks as a surveillance tool to detect WNV/JEV circulation in a region.

Zhu DK, Song XH, Wang JB, Zhou WS, Ou XM, Chen HX, Liu MF, Wang MS, Jia RY, Chen S, Sun KF, Yang Q, Wu Y, Chen XY, Cheng AC	Avian Dis	 2016 Sep;60(3):677-80	 doi: 101637/11396-021916-ResNote1	Avian tuberculosis is a contagious disease affecting various domestic and wild bird species, and is caused by Mycobacterium avium . It is reported extremely rarely in commercial poultry flocks and has not been reported in commercial domestic ducks to date, with domestic ducks reported to be moderately resistant to M. avium infection. Here, we report the outbreak of avian tuberculosis in commercial Pekin duck ( Anas platyrhynchos domestica) flocks. Postmortem and histopathologic findings included nodules presenting in the visceral organs of ducks, and granulomas with central caseous necrosis surrounded by infiltrating lymphocytes. The M. avium pathogen was isolated and further identified by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and PCR based on insert sequence IS901 and the 16S rRNA gene. We highlight that avian tuberculosis not only has economic significance for the duck industry, but also presents a potential zoonotic hazard to humans.
272	27602562	Photocatalytic decomposition behavior and reaction pathways of organic compounds using Cu nanoparticles synthesized via a green route.	Sinha T, Ahmaruzzaman M	Photochem Photobiol Sci	 2016 Oct 5;15(10):1272-1281	 doi: 101039/c6pp00116e Epub 2016 Sep 6	The present article depicts a green, facile and environmentally friendly biosynthetic methodology for the fabrication of Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs) using an aqueous extract of Anas platyrhynchos egg shells. This method is free from the use of any external reducing agents, stabilizing agents, solvents and templates. The Cu NPs were characterized by UV-Vis, TEM, SAED, FTIR, XRD and SEM-EDX. The synthesized Cu NPs were predominantly spherical in nature with an average size of 5-18 nm. The EDX pattern revealed the presence of elemental copper in the Cu NPs. The prepared NPs were used for the remediation of three carcinogenic dyes, namely, Rose Bengal (RB), Methylene Blue (MB) and Methyl Violet 6B (MV6B) from aqueous solution. Approximately, 98.2, 93 and 96% of RB, MB and MV6B dye were degraded within 165, 135 and 150 min, respectively, using the synthesized Cu NPs. To acquire an improved understanding of the mechanistic details of the degradation products, the intermediates were identified using LC-MS. It is assumed that fragmentation of the oxy group takes place for RB, while for MB and MV6B, N-demethylation and N-demethylenation of the substituent on the amine group takes place. It is believed that finally, the conjugated chromophoric structure undergoes cleavage to form the mineralization products. The probable mechanisms for the degradation of the dyes have been presented. The high efficiency of NPs as photocatalysts has opened a promising application for the removal of hazardous dyes from industrial effluents.

Kim J, Kim IK, Oh JM	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	 2016 Dec;134P1:38-42	 doi: 101016/jecoenv201608006 Epub 2016 Aug 29	Trace elements were analyzed in the liver of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons, n=15), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos, n=4) and spot-billed ducks (Anas poecilorhyncha, n=13) found dead in Gimpo, Korea. All mallards and eight spot-billed ducks had embedded lead shot. Embedded shot could be affected elevated trace element concentrations on geese and ducks. Element concentrations of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), aluminum (Al), copper (Cr), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) differed among species and white-fronted geese without embedded shot had the lowest concentrations for all elements (geomean 0.36, 0.43, 0.07, 1.46, 7.60, 2.61 and 13.5microg/g dw, respectively). Cadmium in four (3.27-7.77microg/g dw) of 32 individuals and Pb in eight (5.07-9.72microg/g dw) of 32 individuals exceeded a tentative threshold effect level of Cd (>3.0microg/g dw) and Pb (>5.0microg/g dw) for birds; all geese and ducks for Cr (0.07-0.43microg/g dw) were within the background level (<4.0microg/g dw). All trace element concentrations were much greater in waterfowl species with embedded shot than without shot. Essential trace elements such as Cr, Al (geomean 1.46-37.3microg/g dw), Cu (7.60-57.1microg/g dw), Mn (2.61-27.6microg/g dw) and Zn (13.5-176microg/g dw) were within the normal range and were probably maintained by normal homeostatic mechanisms.
275	27561967	Body mass and immune function, but not bill coloration, predict dominance in female mallards.	Ligon RA, Butler MW	Behav Processes	 2016 Oct;131:59-67	 doi: 101016/jbeproc201608010 Epub 2016 Aug 22	Competition over indivisible resources is common and often costly. Therefore, selection should favor strategies, including efficient communication, that minimize unnecessary costs associated with such competition. For example, signaling enables competitors to avoid engaging in costly asymmetrical contests. Recently, bill coloration has been identified as an information-rich signal used by some birds to mediate aggressive interactions and we evaluated this possibility in female mallards Anas platyrhynchos. Specifically, we conducted two rounds of competitive interactions among groups of unfamiliar adult female ducks. By recording all aggressive behaviors exhibited by each individual, as well as the identity of attack recipients, we were able to assign dominance scores and evaluate links between numerous physiological, morphological, and experimental variables that we predicted would influence contest outcome and dominance. Contrary to our predictions, dominance was not linked to any aspect of bill coloration, access to dietary carotenoids during development, two of three measures of immune function, or ovarian follicle maturation. Instead, heavier birds were more dominant, as were those with reduced immune system responses to an experimentally administered external immunostimulant, phytohemagglutinin. These results suggest that visual signals are less useful during the establishment of dominance hierarchies within multi-individual scramble competitions, and that immune function is correlated with contest strategies in competitions for access to limited resources.
276	27531612	Peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and molecular evolution of vertebrate Cyclophilin A.	Ren LQ, Liu W, Li WB, Liu WJ, Sun L	Yi Chuan	 2016 Aug;38(8):736-45	 doi: 1016288/jyczz15-523	Peptidylprolyl isomerases (PPIase) cyclophilin A (CypA, encoded by PPIA) is a typical member of the Cyclophilin family and is involved in protein folding/translocation, signal transduction, inflammation, immune system regulation, apoptosis and virus replication. In the present study, we investigated the PPIase activity and genetic variation of vertebrate CypA. According to the GenBank reference sequences, vertebrate PPIA genes were cloned, among which the bat (Myotis davidi) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos) PPIA genes were reported for the first time. Then PPIA genes were sub-cloned into the expression vector pGEX-6p-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant CypA proteins were purified by using sepharose 4B affinity chromatography and the GST tag was cleaved, followed by gel filtration. The PPIase activity assay indicated that there was no significant difference in the catalytic activity of prolyl peptide bond isomerization among 12 different vertebrate CypA proteins. In addition, the genetic variation and molecular evolution analysis showed that these vertebrate CypA proteins had the same CsA binding site and the PPIase active sites. Furthermore, the predicted structure and gene localization were remarkable conserved. Our data suggested that the important residues of CypA were highly conserved, which is crucial for its PPIase activity and cellular functions.
277	27524825	The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on beta-Defensins in Waterfowl.	Chapman JR, Hellgren O, Helin AS, Kraus RH, Cromie RL, Waldenstrom J	Mol Biol Evol	 2016 Dec;33(12):3075-3087	 doi: 101093/molbev/msw167 Epub 2016 Aug 14	In disease dynamics, high immune gene diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. beta-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five beta-defensin genes were characterized in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five genes showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific beta-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these genes in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated beta-defensin gene (AvBD3b). For this gene, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of beta-defensin genes allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian beta-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune genes, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.
278	27520070	Genetic parameters of body weight, egg production, and shell quality traits in the Shan Ma laying duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lin RL, Chen HP, Rouvier R, Marie-Etancelin C	Poult Sci	 2016 Nov 1;95(11):2514-2519	 doi: 103382/ps/pew222 Epub 2016 Aug 12	Three hundred and four female ducks of the Chinese indigenous Shan Ma breed, progeny of 11 sires and 104 dams, were used to study laying traits. Among them, 264 ducks were used to study the egg shell quality traits of eggs laid at 300 days of age. The mean age at first egg was 109 days with an average egg weight of 49.6 +/- 3.7 g. Between 210 and 300 days of age, egg weight increased from 65.0 +/- 3.9 g to 67.0 +/- 4.2 g and the mean of the number of eggs laid up to 300 days was 161 +/- 15.0. Egg length was 59.57 +/- 3.01 mm and egg width was 45.02 +/- 1.98 mm, leading to a shape index of 1.32 +/- 0.08. Egg shell thickness was about 0.31 mm whatever the shell region, and the breaking strength was 28.80 +/- 8.29 N. The heritability's estimated using restricted maximum likelihood ( REML: ) methodology were high for egg weights (ranging from 0.43 to 0.61), intermediate for the number of eggs laid (ranging from 0.38 to 0.43), and low for the age at first egg (0.13). Heritability's for egg shell quality traits varied from 0.20 for the breaking strength to 0.44 for egg length, with in-between values of 0.28 for shell thickness and 0.34 for the shape index. The number of eggs laid was not genetically correlated with the age at first egg or egg weight, but was correlated with body weight (rg = +0.54 +/- 0.23). High positive correlations were found between egg weight and body weight traits, and both of these traits (except egg weight at first egg) were highly and positively correlated with egg length and width. Breaking strength was genetically correlated with egg shell thickness (rg = +0.54 +/- 0.19) and the shape index (rg = +0.71 +/- 0.23). These results suggest that an efficient selection strategy could be implemented to improve the egg production of the pure Shan Ma duck line.
279	27509754	A generalizable energetics-based model of avian migration to facilitate continental-scale waterbird conservation.	Lonsdorf EV, Thogmartin WE, Jacobi S, Aagaard K, Coppen J, Davis A, Fox T, Heglund P, Johnson R, Jones MT, Kenow K, Lyons JE, Luke K, Still S, Tavernia B	Ecol Appl	 2016 Jun;26(4):1136-53	 doi: 101890/14-1947	Conserving migratory birds is made especially difficult because of movement among spatially disparate locations across the annual cycle. In light of challenges presented by the scale and ecology of migratory birds, successful conservation requires integrating objectives, management, and monitoring across scales, from local management units to ecoregional and flyway administrative boundaries. We present an integrated approach using a spatially explicit energetic-based mechanistic bird migration model useful to conservation decision-making across disparate scales and locations. This model moves a Mallard-like bird (Anas platyrhynchos), through spring and fall migration as a function of caloric gains and losses across a continental-scale energy landscape. We predicted with this model that fall migration, where birds moved from breeding to wintering habitat, took a mean of 27.5 d of flight with a mean seasonal survivorship of 90.5% (95% Cl = 89.2%, 91.9%), whereas spring migration took a mean of 23.5 d of flight with mean seasonal survivorship of 93.6% (95% CI = 92.5%, 94.7%). Sensitivity analyses suggested that survival during migration was sensitive to flight speed, flight cost, the amount of energy the animal could carry, and the spatial pattern of energy availability, but generally insensitive to total energy availability per se. Nevertheless, continental patterns in the bird-use days occurred principally in relation to wetland cover and agricultural habitat in the fall. Bird-use days were highest in both spring and fall in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and along the coast and near-shore environments of South Carolina. Spatial sensitivity analyses suggested that locations nearer to migratory endpoints were less important to survivorship; for instance, removing energy from a 1036 km2 stopover site at a time from the Atlantic Flyway suggested coastal areas between New Jersey and North Carolina, including the Chesapeake Bay and the North Carolina piedmont, are essential locations for efficient migration and increasing survivorship during spring migration but not locations in Ontario and Massachusetts. This sort of spatially explicit information may allow decision-makers to prioritize their conservation actions toward locations most influential to migratory success. Thus, this mechanistic model of avian migration provides a decision-analytic medium integrating the potential consequences of local actions to flyway-scale phenomena.

Li C, Li Q, Chen Z, Liu G	Infect Genet Evol	 2016 Oct;44:278-280	 doi: 101016/jmeegid201607020 Epub 2016 Jul 19	An unknown infectious disease in Cherry Valley ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) characterized by short beak and strong growth retardation occurred in China during 2015. The causative agent of this disease, tentatively named duck short beak and dwarfism syndrome (DSBDS), as well as the evolutionary relationships between this causative agent and all currently known avian-origin parvoviruses were clarified by virus isolation, transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation, analysis of nuclear acid type, (RT-)PCR identification, whole genome sequencing, and NS1 protein sequences-based phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that the causative agent of DSBDS is closely related with the goose parvovirus-like virus, which is divergent from all currently known avian-origin parvoviruses and should be a novel duck parvovirus (NDPV).

Chen YC, Liu HC, Wei LY, Huang JF, Lin CC, Blesbois E, Chen MC	J Poult Sci	 2016 Jul 25;53(3):223-232	 doi: 102141/jpsa0150162	The in vitro sperm quality parameters (motility, M; viability, V; normal morphology, NM; plasma membrane integrity, PMI; mitochondrial function, MF) in Muscovy drakes (Cairina moschata) were evaluated by using microscopy and flow cytometry, the correlation among sperm quality parameters and results of artificial insemination was also assessed in present study. M, V and NM were detected by phase contrast microscopy assisted with eosinnigrosin staining, and PMI and MF were detected by using flow cytometry within appropriate fluorescence staining (SYBR-14/PI and R123/PI, respectively). Fertility (F), early embryonic mortality (EEM) and the survival embryo rate (SER) were assessed after the artificial insemination of Muscovy or Kaiya duck (Anas platyrhynchos) females. Sperm PMI and MF, the parameters detected by flow cytometry were positively correlated with sperm M, V, and NM, those were detected by phase contrast microscopy (P<0.05). Sperm V and PMI were negatively correlated with the percentage of early embryo mortality of Muscovy duck fertile eggs (P<0.05). The results of the present study showed the relationships among the AI results and the sperm quality parameters detected by microscopy as well as flow cytometry. In conclusion, flow cytometry assisted with microscopy can be an effective tool to evaluate in vitro sperm quality and may contribute to predict the reproductive performances of individual Muscovy drakes, which helps to improve duck production efficiency.
283	27430716	The Minor MHC Class I Gene UDA of Ducks Is Regulated by Let-7 MicroRNA.	Chan WF, Parks-Dely JA, Magor BG, Magor KE	J Immunol	 2016 Aug 15;197(4):1212-20	 doi: 104049/jimmunol1600332 Epub 2016 Jul 18	In many nonmammalian vertebrates, the genomic organization of the MHC class I region leads to biased expression of a single classical MHC class I gene coevolving with TAP transporters, whereas class I genes are poorly expressed. This contrasts to the three codominantly expressed classical MHC class I genes in humans and mice. In a sequenced haplotype from White Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos, there is one predominantly expressed MHC class I, UAA, although they have five MHC class I genes in the complex, arranged TAP1-TAP2-UAA-UBA-UCA-UDA-UEA The UAA gene, situated proximal to the TAP2 gene, is expressed at levels 10-fold greater than that of another expressed gene, UDA. Three duck MHC class I genes (UBA, UCA, and UEA) are predicted to be partially or completely inactivated by promoter defects, introduction of in-frame stop codon, or the lack of a polyadenylation signal. In this study, we confirm that UBA, UCA, and UEA are indeed inactivated through genetic defects at the promoter, whereas UAA and UDA have functionally equivalent promoters. To examine promoter accessibility, we performed bisulfite sequencing and show that none of the MHC class I promoters are inactivated by methylation. We determine that UDA is differentially regulated through its 3' untranslated region. Namely, expression of UDA is downregulated by let-7 microRNA, whereas the predominantly expressed MHC class I UAA is not. Regulation of UDA by let-7 microRNA suggests that the lower expression level is maintained for its function in immunity.

285	27387535	Gait in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and chickens (Gallus gallus) - similarities in adaptation to high growth rate.	Duggan BM, Hocking PM, Clements DN	Biol Open	 2016 Aug 15;5(8):1077-85	 doi: 101242/bio018614	Genetic selection for increased growth rate and muscle mass in broiler chickens has been accompanied by mobility issues and poor gait. There are concerns that the Pekin duck, which is on a similar selection trajectory (for production traits) to the broiler chicken, may encounter gait problems in the future. In order to understand how gait has been altered by selection, the walking ability of divergent lines of high- and low-growth chickens and ducks was objectively measured using a pressure platform, which recorded various components of their gait. In both species, lines which had been selected for large breast muscle mass moved at a slower velocity and with a greater step width than their lighter conspecifics. These high-growth lines also spent more time supported by two feet in order to improve balance when compared with their lighter, low-growth conspecifics. We demonstrate that chicken and duck lines which have been subjected to intense selection for high growth rates and meat yields have adapted their gait in similar ways. A greater understanding of which components of gait have been altered in selected lines with impaired walking ability may lead to more effective breeding strategies to improve gait in poultry.
286	27348207	Virulence Genes and the Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Isolated from Wild Waterbirds, in the Netherlands and Poland.	Kuczkowski M, Krawiec M, Voslamber B, Ksiazczyk M, Ploskonska-Bugla G, Wieliczko A	Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis	 2016 Aug;16(8):528-36	 doi: 101089/vbz20151935 Epub 2016 Jun 27	Affiliation to four phylogroups (A, B1, B2, and D) was examined, among 190 Escherichia coli strains, collected from five, wild waterbird species, including the following: the Greylag goose-Anser anser (61) and the Canada goose-Branta canadensis (33) obtained in the Netherlands, and the Mallard-Anas platyrhynchos (38), the Mute swan-Cygnus olor (37), and the Great cormorant-Phalacrocorax carbo (21) obtained in Poland. Moreover, the prevalence of 10 virulence factors: astA, iss, iucD, irp2, papC, tsh, vat, cva/cvi, stx2f, and bfp, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility to amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, and tetracycline (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] using E-tests) were investigated, in the examined E. coli strains. Results demonstrated that the greatest number of E. coli strains belonged to phylogenetic groups, B1 (86 strains-45.3%) and D (49 strains-25.8%), whereas 40 (21.0%) and only 15 (7.9%) isolates were classified as being of phylogenetic groups, A and B2, respectively. Among the 10 tested virulence-associated genes, 7 genes were detected in 61 examined strains (32.1%) with highly varying frequency. Virulence profiles showed that astA, iss, and irp2 genes were detected most frequently among all examined E. coli strains, isolated from every chosen bird species. Antimicrobial susceptibility, as detected by MIC for the examined antibiotics, is variable among strains isolated from different species of birds. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of E. coli strains, isolated from different species of wild waterbirds and determine their potential pathogenicity to the environment, other birds, and people.
287	27342841	Extensive Allelic Diversity of MHC Class I in Wild Mallard Ducks.	Fleming-Canepa X, Jensen SM, Mesa CM, Diaz-Satizabal L, Roth AJ, Parks-Dely JA, Moon DA, Wong JP, Evseev D, Gossen DA, Tetrault DG, Magor KE	J Immunol	 2016 Aug 1;197(3):783-94	 doi: 104049/jimmunol1502450 Epub 2016 Jun 24	MHC class I is critically involved in defense against viruses, and diversity from polygeny and polymorphism contributes to the breadth of the immune response and health of the population. In this article, we examine MHC class I diversity in wild mallard ducks, the natural host and reservoir of influenza A viruses. We previously showed domestic ducks predominantly use UAA, one of five MHC class I genes, but whether biased expression is also true for wild mallards is unknown. Using RT-PCR from blood, we examined expressed MHC class I alleles from 38 wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and identified 61 unique alleles, typically 1 or 2 expressed alleles in each individual. To determine whether expressed alleles correspond to UAA adjacent to TAP2 as in domestic ducks, we cloned and sequenced genomic UAA-TAP2 fragments from all mallards, which matched transcripts recovered and allowed us to assign most alleles as UAA Allelic differences are primarily located in alpha1 and alpha2 domains in the residues known to interact with peptide in mammalian MHC class I, suggesting the diversity is functional. Most UAA alleles have unique residues in the cleft predicting distinct specificity; however, six alleles have an unusual conserved cleft with two cysteine residues. Residues that influence peptide-loading properties and tapasin involvement in chicken are fixed in duck alleles and suggest tapasin independence. Biased expression of one MHC class I gene may make viral escape within an individual easy, but high diversity in the population places continual pressure on the virus in the reservoir species.
288	27340332	Morphofunctional study of the tongue in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica, Anatidae): LM and SEM study.	Skieresz-Szewczyk K, Jackowiak H	Zoomorphology	 2016;135:255-268	 doi: 101007/s00435-016-0302-2 Epub 2016 Feb 4	The domestic duck, as a representative of birds living in the water, is considered as a specialist filter-feeder. Behavioral observations of foraging revealed that these birds also use a terrestrial feeding mechanism such as grazing and pecking. This study examined the entirety of the lingual mucosa in relation to the structural adaptations required for this range of feeding activities. The structures on the lateral surfaces of the tongue, the conical and filiform papillae, constitute the food filtration apparatus. The process of pecking involves the spatula-shaped apex of the tongue and a specific horny plate-the lingual nail. In the grazing mechanism, large conical papillae and lamellae in the beak are required. Structures engaged in intra-oral transport include the median groove, lingual combs, the rostral border of the lingual prominence and distinct rows of conical papillae on the lingual prominence. Two types of keratinized epithelia, the ortho- and parakeratinized epithelium, as well as nonkeratinized epithelium cover individual areas of the tongue. The rostral and caudal lingual glands present in the lamina propria of the body, lingual prominence and root of the tongue produce mucus. The specific arrangement of Grandry and Herbst corpuscles form so-called bill-tongue organ monitoring food transportation. Our research confirm that the lingual mucosa in domestic duck is characterized by microstructural species-specific modifications of particular areas of the tongue, which is formed not only under the influence of the filtering mechanism, but also by terrestrial feeding mechanisms such as grazing or pecking.

Yacoub HA, Elazzazy AM, Mahmoud MM, Baeshen MN, Al-Maghrabi OA, Alkarim S, Ahmed ES, Almehdar HA, Uversky VN	Dev Comp Immunol	 2016 Dec;65:8-24	 doi: 101016/jdci201606012 Epub 2016 Jun 18	This study was performed to identify the expression patterns of the cathelicidin genes in a local chicken breed and to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the cathelicidin peptides against pathogenic bacteria. This analysis revealed that the coding regions of CATH-1, -2, and -3 genes contain 447 bp, 465 bp, and 456 bp, respectively, and encode proteins of 148, 154, 151 amino acids, respectively. The complete amino acid sequences of the cathelicidin peptides are similar to those found in Meleagris gallopavo, Phasianus colchicus, and Coturnix coturnix, and show high sequence identity to their Columba livia and Anas platyrhynchos counterparts. In contrast, these avian peptides shared a very low sequence identity with the mammalian cathelicidins. The analysis further revealed that the cathelicidin genes are expressed in various organ and tissues. We also show that the CATH peptides 1, 2, 3 and their amide-modified structures possess potent antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, with these bacteria being affected to different extents. The antimicrobial activities of the peptides are slightly lower than those of their amide analogs. Computational analysis revealed that pre-pro-cathelicidins are hybrid proteins that contain ordered domains and functional intrinsically disordered regions. Furthermore, high structural and sequence variability of mature cathelicidins is a strong indication of their rather disordered nature. It is likely that intrinsic disorder is needed for the multifarious functionality of these antimicrobial peptides. Our analyses indicated that cathelicidin peptides require further study to better understand their full potentials in the treatment of diseases in both humans and animals. The data obtained for synthetic avian peptides will help elucidating of their potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry.
290	27317495	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in adult and juvenile mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from the Hudson River, New York, USA.	Madden SS, Skinner LC	Environ Pollut	 2016 Sep;216:487-499	 doi: 101016/jenvpol201605088 Epub 2016 Jun 14	The Hudson River, NY, USA is contaminated for over 300 km with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released from two General Electric (GE) capacitor plants. We collected adult and juvenile mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from four different areas of the river; an area upstream of the GE plants (n = 38), two areas directly downstream of the GE plants (n = 41, n = 38), and an area more than 100 km downstream in the freshwater tidal river (n = 20). Collections occurred during July and August (2008) when ducks were flightless to ensure ducks were "resident" and exposures were local. Fat and muscle tissue were analyzed for PCBs. PCBs were detected in all samples, and mallards below the GE plant sites on the Hudson River had orders of magnitude higher concentrations of PCBs than those above the plants. Juvenile mallards from areas directly downstream of the GE plant sites tended to have higher PCB concentrations in fat than adults. The patterns of PCB congeners and homolog groups varied across the study areas, with areas directly downstream of the GE plants dominated by tetra-chloro biphenyls whereas samples from upstream and the freshwater tidal river tended towards higher chlorinated congeners. Congener patterns between male and female and juvenile and adult mallards were generally similar within study areas, with the exception of one area downstream of the GE plants where adult birds exhibited different patterns than juveniles. Evidence of PCBs from the GE plant sites was detected in the tidal Hudson River, more than 100 km downstream of the plant sites. More than 90% of the ducks collected in areas downstream of the GE plants but above the tidally influenced river exceed the USFDA tolerance level for PCBs in poultry, which should be a concern for consumers of waterfowl taken in proximity to the upper Hudson River.

Johnson FA, Fackler PL, Boomer GS, Zimmerman GS, Williams BK, Nichols JD, Dorazio RM	PLoS One	 2016 Jun 17;11(6):e0157373	 doi: 101371/journalpone0157373 eCollection 2016	Markov decision processes (MDPs), which involve a temporal sequence of actions conditioned on the state of the managed system, are increasingly being applied in natural resource management. This study focuses on the modification of a traditional MDP to account for those cases in which an action must be chosen after a significant time lag in observing system state, but just prior to a new observation. In order to calculate an optimal decision policy under these conditions, possible actions must be conditioned on the previous observed system state and action taken. We show how to solve these problems when the state transition structure is known and when it is uncertain. Our focus is on the latter case, and we show how actions must be conditioned not only on the previous system state and action, but on the probabilities associated with alternative models of system dynamics. To demonstrate this framework, we calculated and simulated optimal, adaptive policies for MDPs with lagged states for the problem of deciding annual harvest regulations for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the United States. In this particular example, changes in harvest policy induced by the use of lagged information about system state were sufficient to maintain expected management performance (e.g. population size, harvest) even in the face of an uncertain system state at the time of a decision.
292	27309083	One Decade of Active Avian Influenza Wild Bird Surveillance in Belgium Showed a Higher Viroprevalence in Hunter-Harvested Than in Live-Ringed Birds.	Steensels M, Vangeluwe D, Linden A, Houdart P, van den Berg TP, Lambrecht B	Avian Dis	 2016 May;60(1 Suppl):387-93	 doi: 101637/11128-050715-ResNote	Active monitoring of avian influenza (AI) viruses in wild birds was initiated in Belgium in 2005 in response to the first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks occurring in Europe. In Belgium, active wild bird surveillance that targeted live-ringed and hunter-harvested wild birds was developed and maintained from 2005 onward. After one decade, this program assimilated, analyzed, and reported on over 35,000 swabs. The 2009-2014 datasets were used for the current analysis because detailed information was available for this period. The overall prevalence of avian influenza (AI) in samples from live-ringed birds during this period was 0.48% whereas it was 6.12% in hunter-harvested samples. While the ringing sampling targeted a large number of bird species and was realized over the years, the hunting sampling was mainly concentrated on mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) during the hunting season, from mid-August to late January. Even when using just AI prevalence for live-ringed A. platyrhynchos during the hunting season, the value remained significantly lower (2.10%) compared to that detected for hunter-harvested mallards. One explanation for this significant difference in viroprevalence in hunter-harvested mallards was the game restocking practice, which released captive-bred birds in the wild before the hunting period. Indeed, the released game restocking birds, having an AI-naive immune status, could act as local amplifiers of AI viruses already circulating in the wild, and this could affect AI epidemiology. Also, the release into the wild of noncontrolled restocking birds might lead to the introduction of new strains in the natural environment, leading to increased AI presence in the environment. Consequently, the release of naive or infected restocking birds may affect AI dynamics.
293	27309073	Assessment of the Potential Distance of Dispersal of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus by Wild Mallards.	Smietanka K, Bocian L, Meissner W, Zietek-Barszcz A, Zolkos K	Avian Dis	 2016 May;60(1 Suppl):316-21	 doi: 101637/11080-040715-RegR	This work presents the results of studies aimed at assessing the median and maximum distances covered by wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos; n = 38), hypothetically infected with the high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) during spring migrations, using GPS-GSM tracking and published data on the susceptibility to HPAIV infection and duration of shedding. The model was based on the assumptions that the birds shed virus in the absence of clinical signs during infectious periods (IP) that were assumed to last 1 day (IP1), 4 days (IP4), and 8 days (IP8) and that each day of migration is a hypothetical day of the onset of IP. Using the haversine formula over a sliding timeframe corresponding to each IP, distances were estimated for each duck that undertook migration and then the maximum distance (Dmax) was selected. Ten mallards undertook spring migrations but, due to the loss of signal in the GPS-GSM devices, only three ducks were observed during autumn migrations. The following ranges of Dmax values were calculated for spring migrations: 124-382 km for IP1 (median 210 km), 208-632 km for IP4 (median 342 km), and 213-687 km for IP8 (median 370 km). The present study provides information that can be used as a data source to perform risk assessment related to the contribution of wild mallards in the dispersal of HPAIV over considerable distances.
294	27309072	Tracking Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with GPS Satellite Transmitters Along Their Migration Route Through Northeast Asia.	Shin JH, Lee KS, Kim SH, Hwang JK, Woo C, Kim J, Kim JH, Suh JH, Jeong J, Wang SJ, Chung HM, Yu SD, Choi KH, Mo IP	Avian Dis	 2016 May;60(1 Suppl):311-5	 doi: 101637/11096-042015-Reg	In this study, Global Positioning System satellite transmitters were attached to three mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) wintering in South Korea to track their migration routes, stopover sites, breeding sites, and migration patterns. We successfully tracked only one mallard (no. 108917) from November 15, 2011, to November 29, 2013, and determined separate migration routes in two cases of spring migration and one case of fall migration. The mallard repeatedly migrated to the same final destination, even though the travel path varied. We identified six stopover sites: Hunhe River, Liaohe River, Yinma River, Yalu River, Songjeon Bay, and Dahuofang Reservoir in China and South Korea. The wintering sites of two migration cases were discovered to be identical (Gokgyo River in Asan, South Korea). The terminal sites, which were presumed to be breeding grounds, were the same in both cases (Hinggan League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China). On the basis of the migration routes identified in this study, we suggest that future efforts to control highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) should not only include avian influenza surveillance but also implement flyway-based strategies, with regard to all countries affected by potential HPAI outbreaks.
295	27309057	Recombinant Turkey Herpesvirus-AI Vaccine Virus Replication in Different Species of Waterfowl.	Palya V, Kovacs EW, Tatar-Kis T, Felfoldi B, Homonnay ZG, Mato T, Sato T, Gardin Y	Avian Dis	 2016 May;60(1 Suppl):210-7	 doi: 101637/11129-050715-Reg	Waterfowl play a key role in the epidemiology of the H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus; therefore, efficient immunization of domesticated ducks and geese to maximize the impact of other control measures is of great importance. A recombinant (r)HVT-AI, expressing the HA gene of a clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAI strain had been developed and proved to be efficient against different clades of H5N1 HPAI virus in chickens after a single vaccination at 1 day old and could provide long-term immunity. We investigated whether rHVT-AI applied at 1 day old is able to replicate in different species and crossbreeds of ducks and in geese with the aim of collecting data on the possible application of rHVT-AI vaccine in different species of waterfowl for the control of H5N1 HPAI. We tested the possible differences among different waterfowl species, i.e., between geese (Anser anser, domesticated greylag goose), Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata forma domestica), Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos forma domestica), and mule ducks (Muscovy duck x Pekin duck), in their susceptibility to support the replication of rHVT-AI. Vaccine virus replication was followed by real-time PCR in spleen, bursa, and feather tip samples. Humoral immune response to vaccination was tested using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and H5-specific commercial ELISA. Significant differences among the different waterfowl species regarding the rate of rHVT-AI replication was detected that were not reflected by the same difference in the immune response to vaccination. Replication of the rHVT-AI vaccine was very limited in Pekin ducks, somewhat better in mule ducks, and the vaccine virus was replicating significantly better in Muscovy ducks and geese, reaching 100% detectability at certain time points after administration at 1 day old. Results indicated that the vaccine virus could establish different levels of persistent infection in these species of waterfowl. No humoral immune response could be detected either by HI test or ELISA during the tested postvaccination period (5 wk).
296	27284287	Duck gut viral metagenome analysis captures snapshot of viral diversity.	Fawaz M, Vijayakumar P, Mishra A, Gandhale PN, Dutta R, Kamble NM, Sudhakar SB, Roychoudhary P, Kumar H, Kulkarni DD, Raut AA	Gut Pathog	 2016 Jun 9;8:30	 doi: 101186/s13099-016-0113-5 eCollection 2016	BACKGROUND: Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) an economically important waterfowl for meat, eggs and feathers; is also a natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. The emergence of novel viruses is attributed to the status of co-existence of multiple types and subtypes of viruses in the reservoir hosts. For effective prediction of future viral epidemic or pandemic an in-depth understanding of the virome status in the key reservoir species is highly essential. METHODS: To obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of ducks by viral metagenomic approach, we deep sequenced the viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from the flock of 23 ducks which shared the water bodies with wild migratory birds. RESULT: In total 7,455,180 reads with average length of 146 bases were generated of which 7,354,300 reads were de novo assembled into 24,945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases and the remaining 100,880 reads were singletons. The duck virome were identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons (BLASTx E score, <10(-3)) against viral reference database. Numerous duck virome sequences were homologous to the animal virus of the Papillomaviridae family; and phages of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, Tectiviridae, Microviridae families and unclassified phages. Further, several duck virome sequences had homologous with the insect viruses of the Poxviridae, Alphatetraviridae, Baculoviridae, Densovirinae, Iflaviridae and Dicistroviridae families; and plant viruses of the Secoviridae, Virgaviridae, Tombusviridae and Partitiviridae families, which reflects the diet and habitation of ducks. CONCLUSION: This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity and expands the knowledge about the spectrum of viruses harboured in the enteric tract of ducks.
297	27260395	Express Sequence Tag Analysis - Identification of Anseriformes Trypsin Genes from Full-Length cDNA Library of the Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and Characterization of Their Structure and Function.	Yu H, Cai S, Gao J, Wang C, Qiao X, Wang H, Feng L, Wang Y	Biochemistry (Mosc)	 2016 Feb;81(2):152-62	 doi: 101134/S0006297916020097	Trypsins are key proteins important in animal protein digestion by breaking down the peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues, hence it has been used widely in various biotechnological processes. In the current study, a full-length cDNA library with capacity of 5.10(5) CFU/ml from the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was constructed. Using express sequence tag (EST) sequencing, genes coding two trypsins were identified and two full-length trypsin cDNAs were then obtained by rapid-amplification of cDNA end (RACE)-PCR. Using Blast, they were classified into the trypsin I and II subfamilies, but both encoded a signal peptide, an activation peptide, and a 223-a.a. mature protein located in the C-terminus. The two deduced mature proteins were designated as trypsin-IAP and trypsin-IIAP, and their theoretical isoelectric points (pI) and molecular weights (MW) were 7.99/23466.4 Da and 4.65/24066.0 Da, respectively. Molecular characterizations of genes were further performed by detailed bioinformatics analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that trypsin-IIAP has an evolution pattern distinct from trypsin-IAP, suggesting its evolutionary advantage. Then the duck trypsin-IIAP was expressed in an Escherichia coli system, and its kinetic parameters were measured. The three dimensional structures of trypsin-IAP and trypsin-IIAP were predicted by homology modeling, and the conserved residues required for functionality were identified. Two loops controlling the specificity of the trypsin and the substrate-binding pocket represented in the model are almost identical in primary sequences and backbone tertiary structures of the trypsin families.
298	27188826	Survey on intestinal helminth fauna of woodcocks (Scolopax rusticola) in Italy.	Paoletti B, Di Cesare A, Iorio R, Tavaglione D, Bartolini R, Gatti A	Vet Ital	 2016 Jun 30;52(2):117-21	 doi: 1012834/VetIt15382	Every year populations of the European woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) migrate from Central and Northern Europe to the Mediterranean basin. South of Italy is one of the most common wintering site for this species. Given that information on parasites of woodcocks is scarce, the present study aimed at identifying the parasitic species affecting woodcocks migrating in Italy. The gastrointestinal tract of 206 woodcocks hunted in Southern Italy was removed and examined for parasites. From each animal a faecal sample was analysed by flotation test. The necropsy showed the presence of cestodes, i.e. Paricterotaenia paradoxa (59.4%) and Aploparaksis filum (49.5%), and of acanthocephalan Prosthorhynchus scolopacidis (22.4%). In one bird we also detected Parastrigea robusta, which is a trematode until now reported only in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Mixed infections (i.e., polyspecific infections) were detected in 53 (27.6%) animals. The most common were those caused by A. filum and P. paradoxa (12.5%), and by P. paradoxa and P. scolopacidis (8.3%). Copromicroscopic examinations revealed the presence of eggs belonging to nematodes Syngamus spp. (1.94%) in 4 woodcocks and of eggs of cestodes Aploparaksis spp. (37.86%) in 78 woodcocks. The present results fill a gap in the knowledge on parasites affecting woodcocks.
299	29988198	First report of Anatoecus dentatus in domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus, Linnaeus, 1978) from Southern India.	N J, D BA, J S	Parasite Epidemiol Control	 2016 May 17;1(2):131-135	 doi: 101016/jparepi201605003 eCollection 2016 Jun	Parasitic infection is one of the prime causes for morbidity and mortality of ducks in India. Ducks have the habit of wading through the water resources especially paddy fields and feeding on snail which favours occurrence of various parasites. Among the parasites, lice infestation affects growth and productivity of ducks by way of irritation. Lice are well adapted as external parasites and usually are more a nuisance than a threat to their hosts. A nomadic farmer from Mannargudi area of Cauvery delta region of Tamil Nadu, India who had a flock of 1600 ducks reported continuous death of 700 ducks within a period of one month and brought a dead duck to Dept. of Veterinary Pathology for postmortem examination. Examination of entire body of duck prior to necropsy revealed the presence of live lice in the hairs around the junction of beak and head. About 7 lice specimens were collected and brought to Dept. of Veterinary Parasitology for identification. The lice specimens were processed and identified as Anatoecus dentatus based on the presence of 'tin opener' shaped effracter in the male genitalia. This is the first report of occurrence of these lice in ducks from Southern India.
300	27175180	Molecular phylogeny of some avian species using Cytochrome b gene sequence analysis.	Awad A, Khalil SR, Abd-Elhakim YM	Iran J Vet Res	 2015 Spring;16(2):218-22		Veritable identification and differentiation of avian species is a vital step in conservative, taxonomic, forensic, legal and other ornithological interventions. Therefore, this study involved the application of molecular approach to identify some avian species i.e. Chicken (Gallus gallus), Muskovy duck (Cairina moschata), Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), Laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), and Rock pigeon (Columba livia). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and partial sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (358 bp) was amplified and sequenced using universal primers. Sequences alignment and phylogenetic analyses were performed by CLC main workbench program. The obtained five sequences were deposited in GenBank and compared with those previously registered in GenBank. The similarity percentage was 88.60% between Gallus gallus and Coturnix japonica and 80.46% between Gallus gallus and Columba livia. The percentage of identity between the studied species and GenBank species ranged from 77.20% (Columba oenas and Anas platyrhynchos) to 100% (Gallus gallus and Gallus sonneratii, Coturnix coturnix and Coturnix japonica, Meleagris gallopavo and Columba livia). Amplification of the partial sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene proved to be practical for identification of an avian species unambiguously.
301	27115519	Meiotic recombination analysis in female ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Pigozzi MI, Del Priore L	Genetica	 2016 Jun;144(3):307-12	 doi: 101007/s10709-016-9899-9 Epub 2016 Apr 26	Meiotic recombination in female ducks was directly studied by immunolocalization of MLH1 protein, a mismatch repair protein of mature recombination nodules. In total, 6820 crossovers were scored along the autosomal synaptonemal complexes in 122 meiotic nuclei. From this analysis we predict that the female map length of the duck is 2845 cM, with a genome wide recombination rate of 2 cM/Mb. MLH1-focus mapping along the six largest bivalents shows regional variations of recombination frequencies that can be linked to differences in chromosome morphology. From this MLH1 mapping it can be inferred that distally located markers will appear more separated in genetic maps than physically equidistant markers located near the centromeres on bivalents 1 and 2. Instead, markers at interstitial positions on the acrocentric bivalents 3-6 will appear more tightly linked than expected on the basis of their physical distance because recombination is comparatively lower at the mid region of these chromosomes. The present results provide useful information to complement linkage mapping in ducks and extend previous knowledge about the variation of recombination rates among domestic Galloanserae.
302	27064738	Discovery, Characterization, and Functional Study of a Novel MEF2D CAG Repeat in Duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wang Y, Wang J, Liu H, Zhang R, Zhang T, Gan X, Huang H, Chen D, Li L	DNA Cell Biol	 2016 Aug;35(8):398-409	 doi: 101089/dna20163222 Epub 2016 Apr 11	Myocyte enhancer transcription factor 2D (MEF2D) is an important transcription factor for promoting the growth and development of muscle. CAG repeats have been found in the coding sequence (CDS) of avian MEF2D; however, their functions remain unknown and require further investigation. Here, we examined the characteristics and functional role of MEF2D CAG repeat in duck. The full-length CDS of duck MEF2D was cloned for the first time, and a novel CAG repeat was identified and located in exon 9. Sequence analysis indicated that the protein domains of duck MEF2D are highly conserved relative to other vertebrates, whereas MEF2D CAG repeats with variable repeat numbers are specific to avian species. Furthermore, sequencing has revealed polymorphisms in MEF2D CAG repeat at both DNA and mRNA levels. Four MEF2D CAG repeat genotypes and 10 MEF2D cDNA variants with different CAG repeat numbers were detected in two duck populations. A t-test showed that the expanded CAG repeat generated significantly longer transcription products (p < 0.05). Association analysis demonstrated positive correlations between the expansion of the CAG repeat and five muscle-related traits. By using protein structure prediction, we suggested that the polymorphisms of the CAG repeat affect protein structures within protein domains. Taken together, these findings reveal that duck MEF2D CAG repeat is a potential functional element with polymorphisms and may cause differences in MEF2D function between duck and other vertebrate species.
303	27044589	Distribution of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (GAL) in the pterygopalatine ganglion of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica).	Radzimirska M, Bogus-Nowakowska K, Kuder T, Robak A	Folia Histochem Cytobiol	 2016;54(1):25-31	 doi: 105603/FHCa20160002 Epub 2016 Apr 5	INTRODUCTION: Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (GAL) act as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Their presence has been found in different taxonomic groups, in particular in mammals. However, only few investigators have studied these neuropeptides in the class Aves (birds). The aim of the present study was to describe the distribution of CART, NPY and GAL in the pterygopalatine ganglion (PPG) of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiment was conducted on 16 one-year-old domestic ducks of the Pekin breed of both sexes (8 males and 8 females). Frozen sections of the PPG were subjected to immunofluorescence staining using primary mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against CART and GAL and rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against NPY. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with Cy3 and FITC fluorochromes. RESULTS: CART, NPY, and GAL were present in the PPG of the domestic duck. The highest immunoreactivity (IR) in the ganglionic cells was found for CART in the majority (83-85%) of neurons of both superior (SPPG) and inferior (IPPG) PPG. CART-IR was also found in small aggregations of neurons on the medial surface of the Harderian gland, and on the course of the palatine branch of the facial nerve. CART-IR was also observed in the nerve fibers of these neurons' aggregations; however, it was low in comparison to the immunoreactivity of the perikarya. Immunoreactivity of NPY was found in ganglionic neurons, but above all in numerous fibers of the SPPG and IPPG and within aggregations on the surface of the Harderian gland. NPY-IR cells were distributed irregularly over the cross-sections of the tested aggregations, and constituted from 36% to 43% of the SPPG and from 37% to 40% of the IPPG of all cross-sectioned neurons. GAL-immunoreactive perikarya, distributed irregularly across the sections, were observed in the SPPG, where they constituted 61-65%, and in the IPPG, where they made up 50-57% of all neurons. All immunoreactive neurons were characterized by immunopositive neuroplasm and immunonegative cell nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CART, NPY, and GAL in the PPG of the domestic duck suggests that these peptides may contribute to the secretory innervation of the glands of the mucosa of the palate and nasal cavity, the Harderian gland, and the lacrimal gland.
304	27040525	Characterization of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) Rbm24 and Rbm38 genes and their expression profiles in myoblast and skeletal muscle tissues.	Sun W, Hu Y, Xu H, He H, Han C, Liu H, Wang J, Li L	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 2016 Aug;198:27-36	 doi: 101016/jcbpb201603008 Epub 2016 Mar 31	RNA-binding motif proteins 24 (Rbm24) and 38 (Rbm38) are known to regulate genes expression in a post-transcriptional way. However, it remains unclear about the similarities and differences between Rbm24 and Rbm38 in terms of their sequence characteristics and expression profiles during myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle development. In this study, we found that the coding domain sequences (CDSs) of duck Rbm24 and Rbm38 consisted of 678 and 648 nucleotides, respectively. Both of them contain a conserved RNA-recognition motif (RRM). Phylogenetic analysis showed that duck Rbm24 and Rbm38 were clustered with other Aves, nevertheless, avian Rbm24 was clustered with mammalian and reptilian Rbm24; avian Rbm38 was clustered with amphibian and reptilian Rbm38. Real-time PCR results exhibited that during embryonic stage, Rbm24 and Rbm38 in leg and breast muscle increased to their peak (P<0.01) at same time. During postnatal stage, the peak of Rbm24 and Rbm38 in leg were found at W5, while the peak of them in breast was found at W6 (P<0.01). Moreover, a relative high value of Rbm24 and Rbm38 in leg was found at W1 and W3, respectively. Additionally, both Rbm24 and Rbm38 expressed at each stage of duck myoblast differentiation, however, Rbm24 shared similar expression profiles with MEF2C, and Rbm38 shared similar expression profiles with MyoG and MEF2A. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering results were consistent with the preceding findings. These results serve as a foundation for further investigations about similar and different effects of Rbm24 and Rbm38 on myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle development.
305	26998334	Does influenza A virus infection affect movement behaviour during stopover in its wild reservoir host-	Bengtsson D, Safi K, Avril A, Fiedler W, Wikelski M, Gunnarsson G, Elmberg J, Tolf C, Olsen B, Waldenstrom J	R Soc Open Sci	 2016 Feb 10;3(2):150633	 doi: 101098/rsos150633 eCollection 2016 Feb	The last decade has seen a surge in research on avian influenza A viruses (IAVs), in part fuelled by the emergence, spread and potential zoonotic importance of highly pathogenic virus subtypes. The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the most numerous and widespread dabbling duck in the world, and one of the most important natural hosts for studying IAV transmission dynamics. In order to predict the likelihood of IAV transmission between individual ducks and to other hosts, as well as between geographical regions, it is important to understand how IAV infection affects the host. In this study, we analysed the movements of 40 mallards equipped with GPS transmitters and three-dimensional accelerometers, of which 20 were naturally infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), at a major stopover site in the Northwest European flyway. Movements differed substantially between day and night, as well as between mallards returning to the capture site and those feeding in natural habitats. However, movement patterns did not differ between LPAIV infected and uninfected birds. Hence, LPAIV infection probably does not affect mallard movements during stopover, with high possibility of virus spread along the migration route as a consequence.
306	26981693	SURVEY FOR WEST NILE VIRUS ANTIBODIES IN WILD DUCKS, 2004-06, USA.	Hofmeister EK, Jankowski MD, Goldberg D, Franson JC	J Wildl Dis	 2016 Apr 28;52(2):354-63	 doi: 107589/2015-06-137 Epub 2016 Mar 16	Detection of West Nile virus (WNV) in ducks has been reported in North America in isolated cases of mortality in wild waterbirds and following outbreaks in farmed ducks. Although the virus has been noted as an apparent incidental finding in several species of ducks, little is known about the prevalence of exposure or the outcome of infection with WNV in wild ducks in North America. From 2004-06, we collected sera from 1,406 wild-caught American Wigeon ( Anas americana ), Mallard ( Anas platyrhynchos ), and Northern Pintail ( Anas acuta ) ducks at national wildlife refuges (NWRs) in North Dakota and Wood Ducks ( Aix sponsa ) at NWRs in South Carolina and Tennessee. We measured the prevalence of previous exposure to WNV in these ducks by measuring WNV antibodies and evaluated variation in exposure among species, age, and year. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of a commercial antibody to wild bird immunoglobulin in duck species that varied in their phylogenetic relatedness to the bird species the antibody was directed against. As determined by a screening immunoassay and a confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization assay, the prevalence of WNV antibody was 10%. In light of experimental studies that show ducks to be relatively resistant to mortality caused by WNV, the antibody prevalence we detected suggests that wild ducks may be less-frequently exposed to WNV than expected for birds inhabiting wetlands where they may acquire infection from mosquitoes.
307	26957635	Identification and comparative proteomic study of quail and duck egg white protein using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry analysis.	Hu S, Qiu N, Liu Y, Zhao H, Gao D, Song R, Ma M	Poult Sci	 2016 May;95(5):1137-44	 doi: 103382/ps/pew033 Epub 2016 Mar 8	A proteomic study of egg white proteins from 2 major poultry species, namely quail (Coturnix coturnix) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos), was performed with comparison to those of chicken (Gallus gallus) through 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis. By using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS/MS), 29 protein spots representing 10 different kinds of proteins as well as 17 protein spots designating 9 proteins were successfully identified in quail and duck egg white, respectively. This report suggested a closer relationship between quail and chicken egg white proteome patterns, whereas the duck egg white protein distribution on the 2-DE map was more distinct. In duck egg white, some well-known major proteins, such as ovomucoid, clusterin, extracellular fatty acid-binding protein precursor (ex-FABP), and prostaglandin D2 synthase (PG D2 synthase), were not detected, while two major protein spots identified as "deleted in malignant brain tumors 1" protein (DMBT1) and vitellogenin-2 were found specific to duck in the corresponding range on the 2-DE gel map. These interspecies diversities may be associated with the egg white protein functions in cell defense or regulating/supporting the embryonic development to adapt to the inhabiting environment or reproduction demand during long-term evolution. The findings of this work will give insight into the advantages involved in the application on egg white proteins from various egg sources, which may present novel beneficial properties in the food industry or related to human health.
308	26953940	Efficacy of a Recombinant Turkey Herpesvirus H5 Vaccine Against Challenge With H5N1 Clades 1.1.2 and 2.3.2.1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Domestic Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Pantin-Jackwood MJ, Kapczynski DR, DeJesus E, Costa-Hurtado M, Dauphin G, Tripodi A, Dunn JR, Swayne DE	Avian Dis	 2016 Mar;60(1):22-32	 doi: 101637/11282-091615-Reg1	Domestic ducks are the second most abundant poultry species in many Asian countries and have played a critical role in the epizootiology of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).In this study, the protective efficacy of a live recombinant vector vaccine based on a turkey herpesvirus (HVT) expressing the H5 gene from a clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAI strain (A/Swan/Hungary/4999/ 2006) (rHVT-H5/2.2), given at 3 days of age, was examined in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus). The vaccine was given alone or in combination with an inactivated H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1 reverse genetic (rgGD/2.3.2.1) vaccine given at 16 days of age, either as a single vaccination or in a prime-boost regime. At 30 days of age, ducks were challenged with one of two H5N1 HPAI viruses: A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-2721/2013 (clade 1.1.2) or A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-1584/2012 (clade 2.3.2.1.C). These viruses produced 100% mortality in less than 5 days in nonvaccinated control ducks. Ducks vaccinated with the rgGD/2.3.2.1 vaccine, with or without the rHVT-H5/2.2 vaccine, were 90%-100% protected against mortality after challenge with either of the two H5N1 HPAI viruses. The rHVT-H5/2.2 vaccine alone, however, conferred only 30% protection against mortality after challenge with either H5N1 HPAI virus; the surviving ducks from these groups shed higher amount of virus and for longer than the single-vaccinated rgGD/2.3.2.1 group. Despite low protection, ducks vaccinated with the rHVT-H5/2.2 vaccine and challenged with the clade 1.1.2 Vietnam virus had a longer mean death time than nonvaccinated controls (P = 0.02). A booster effect was found on reduction of virus shedding when using both vaccines, with lower oropharyngeal viral titers at 4 days after challenge with either HPAI virus (P < 0.05). Neither rHVT-H5/2.2 nor standard HVT vaccine could be detected in samples collected from multiple tissues at different time points, indicting minimal levels of viral replication. In conclusion, although a minor effect on survival was observed, this study demonstrates the suboptimal protection with the rHVT-H5/2.2 vaccine given alone in Pekin ducks against H5N1 HPAI viruses and only a minor additive effect on virus shedding reduction when used with an inactivated vaccine in a prime-boost regime.
309	26938459	High Prevalence and Putative Lineage Maintenance of Avian Coronaviruses in Scandinavian Waterfowl.	Wille M, Muradrasoli S, Nilsson A, Jarhult JD	PLoS One	 2016 Mar 3;11(3):e0150198	 doi: 101371/journalpone0150198 eCollection 2016	Coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, and constitute a risk for zoonotic and emerging infectious disease. In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described, but little is known about the features of CoVs in wild birds. In this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in Sweden collected in 2006/2007 for CoV, with an overall CoV prevalence of 18.7%, which is higher than many other wild bird surveys. The highest prevalence was found in the diving ducks--mainly Greater Scaup (Aythya marila; 51.5%)--and the dabbling duck Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; 19.2%). Sequences from two of the Greater Scaup CoV fell into an infrequently detected lineage, shared only with a Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) CoV. Coronavirus sequences from Mallards in this study were highly similar to CoV sequences from the sample species and location in 2011, suggesting long-term maintenance in this population. A single Black-headed Gull represented the only positive sample from the order Charadriiformes. Globally, Anas species represent the largest fraction of avian CoV sequences, and there seems to be no host species, geographical or temporal structure. To better understand the eitiology, epidemiology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected CoV is imperative.
310	26908889	Triple-yolked eggs in domestic ducks: a rare occurrence.	Salamon A, Kent JP	Poult Sci	 2016 May;95(5):1179-81	 doi: 103382/ps/pew004 Epub 2016 Feb 15	Multiple-yolked avian eggs, and especially triple-yolked (TY) eggs, are rare. Over two years, 48,224 duck eggs (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were individually candled and seven (0.0145%) TY eggs were identified in a commercial breeding and incubation environment. When compared with double-yolked eggs (Salamon and Kent,2016) their mean weight, length, width and shape index did not differ, but their dimensions were greater than for single-yolked duck eggs. Yolk fertility in the TY eggs was low (33.33%), and this was attributed to smaller yolk size and early ovulation and/or follicle immaturity. By day 8 of incubation, fertile yolks were positioned next to the airspace. Egg 5 contained one fertile yolk, and the embryo developed to enter the airspace, was consuming all three yolks, but failed to hatch.
311	26896549	Development of endothermy and concomitant increases in cardiac and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in the precocial Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Sirsat SK, Sirsat TS, Faber A, Duquaine A, Winnick S, Sotherland PR, Dzialowski EM	J Exp Biol	 2016 Apr 15;219(Pt 8):1214-23	 doi: 101242/jeb132282 Epub 2016 Feb 19	Attaining endothermic homeothermy occurs at different times post-hatching in birds and is associated with maturation of metabolic and aerobic capacity. Simultaneous measurements at the organism, organ and cellular levels during the transition to endothermy reveal means by which this change in phenotype occurs. We examined development of endothermy in precocial Pekin ducks ( ITALIC! Anas platyrhynchos domestica) by measuring whole-animal O2consumption ( ITALIC! VO2 ) as animals cooled from 35 to 15 degrees C. We measured heart ventricle mass, an indicator of O2delivery capacity, and mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized skeletal and cardiac muscle to elucidate associated changes in mitochondrial capacities at the cellular level. We examined animals on day 24 of incubation through 7 days post-hatching. ITALIC! VO2 of embryos decreased when cooling from 35 to 15 degrees C; ITALIC! VO2 of hatchlings, beginning on day 0 post-hatching, increased during cooling with a lower critical temperature of 32 degrees C. Yolk-free body mass did not change between internal pipping and hatching, but the heart and thigh skeletal muscle grew at faster rates than the rest of the body as the animals transitioned from an externally pipped paranate to a hatchling. Large changes in oxidative phosphorylation capacity occurred during ontogeny in both thigh muscles, the primary site of shivering, and cardiac ventricles. Thus, increased metabolic capacity necessary to attain endothermy was associated with augmented metabolic capacity of the tissue and augmented increasing O2delivery capacity, both of which were attained rapidly at hatching.
312	26886224	A Panel of Stably Expressed Reference Genes for Real-Time qPCR Gene Expression Studies of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Chapman JR, Helin AS, Wille M, Atterby C, Jarhult JD, Fridlund JS, Waldenstrom J	PLoS One	 2016 Feb 17;11(2):e0149454	 doi: 101371/journalpone0149454 eCollection 2016	Determining which reference genes have the highest stability, and are therefore appropriate for normalising data, is a crucial step in the design of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) gene expression studies. This is particularly warranted in non-model and ecologically important species for which appropriate reference genes are lacking, such as the mallard--a key reservoir of many diseases with relevance for human and livestock health. Previous studies assessing gene expression changes as a consequence of infection in mallards have nearly universally used beta-actin and/or GAPDH as reference genes without confirming their suitability as normalisers. The use of reference genes at random, without regard for stability of expression across treatment groups, can result in erroneous interpretation of data. Here, eleven putative reference genes for use in gene expression studies of the mallard were evaluated, across six different tissues, using a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus infection model. Tissue type influenced the selection of reference genes, whereby different genes were stable in blood, spleen, lung, gastrointestinal tract and colon. beta-actin and GAPDH generally displayed low stability and are therefore inappropriate reference genes in many cases. The use of different algorithms (GeNorm and NormFinder) affected stability rankings, but for both algorithms it was possible to find a combination of two stable reference genes with which to normalise qPCR data in mallards. These results highlight the importance of validating the choice of normalising reference genes before conducting gene expression studies in ducks. The fact that nearly all previous studies of the influence of pathogen infection on mallard gene expression have used a single, non-validated reference gene is problematic. The toolkit of putative reference genes provided here offers a solid foundation for future studies of gene expression in mallards and other waterfowl.
313	26865954	Timing and location of reproduction in African waterfowl: an overview of >100 years of nest records.	Cumming GS, Harebottle DM, Mundava J, Otieno N, Tyler SJ	Ecol Evol	 2016 Jan 18;6(3):631-46	 doi: 101002/ece31853 eCollection 2016 Feb	The timing and location of reproduction are fundamental elements of reproductive success for all organisms. Understanding why animals choose to reproduce at particular times and in particular places is also important for our understanding of other aspects of organismal ecology, such as their habitat requirements, movement strategies, and biogeography. Although breeding patterns in waterfowl are relatively well documented, most studies are from northern temperate regions and the influences of location and time of year on breeding in Afrotropical ducks (Anatidae) are poorly understood. We outline six alternative (but not mutually exclusive) hypotheses that might explain where and when Afrotropical ducks choose to breed. To explore these hypotheses, we assembled and analyzed a new database of c. 22,000 breeding records for 16 Afrotropical ducks and one introduced Palearctic species (the Mallard Anas platyrhynchos). The full database is available on line as an appendix to this article. We identified five distinct breeding strategies as well as two outliers. Peak breeding for 9 of 16 indigenous duck species occurs during the dry season. We found no evidence for spatial synchrony or spatial autocorrelation in breeding, suggesting a high level of flexibility in waterfowl responses to prevailing conditions in any given year. More intensive analyses of alternative hypotheses are needed, but our initial analysis suggests that the timing of breeding for the majority of Afrotropical ducks is driven by a combination of resource availability and predation risk.
314	26862514	Developmental ossification sequences of the appendicular and axial skeleton in Kuttanad duck embryos (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Firdous AD, Maya S, Massarat K, Baba MA	Open Vet J	 2016;6(1):1-5	 doi: 104314/ovjv6i11 Epub 2016 Jan 12	The processes of ossification sequences are poorly investigated for birds in general, even for domestic and experimental species and when it comes to the waterfowl it is almost negligible. Such sequences constitute a rich source of data on character evolution, and may even provide phylogenetic information. A pre-hatch developmental study on ossification sequences of axial and appendicular skeletal system in Kuttanad duck embryos was undertaken using 78 viable embryos. From day 3 to day 7 of incubation no ossification densities were seen both by alizarin red staining and computerized radiography. The first indication of ossification as small ossification centers in skull bones, clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius and ulna in forelimb and ilium, pubis femur and fibula in hind limb were observed on the 9(th) day of incubation. The ossification of the body of the ribs started at the 11(th) day of incubation towards the proximal extremity. On day 13(th) the ossification process of vertebrae was started from cervical end. The variation in appearance of the ossification centers in different bones at different stages of incubation period suggests relative importance of phylogeny to the sequences.
315	26861074	Global transcriptional expression in ovarian follicles from Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) with a high-fertilization rate.	Wu SJ, Cheng YS, Liu HL, Wang HH, Huang HL	Theriogenology	 2016 May;85(8):1439-1445	e1 doi: 101016/jtheriogenology201601005 Epub 2016 Jan 13	Novel candidates for biomarkers of a high-fertilization rate were identified here through global transcriptional profiling of ovarian follicles. Some other differentially expressed candidate genes were first noted to influence animal reproduction in our previous cDNA microarray analysis and are now recognized as markers for marker-assisted selection. In the present study, we compared gene expression in ovarian follicles from animals with high- and low-fertilization rates using an oligonucleotide array. On the basis of a fold change of greater than 1.2 and less than -1.2, a difference of >100 Affymetrix arbitrary units between the two groups, and a P value of less than 0.05, 47 genes were found to be associated with fertilization rate. GOEAST and MetaCore software were further used to identify the functional categories of genes that were differentially expressed. Then, we focused on three interesting genes associated with a high-fertilization rate: one of these genes was discovered to participate in signaling pathways of fertilization, and two genes take roles in lipid metabolism. An oligonucleotide array showed that the levels of orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene expression were 1.62-fold and 1.95-fold higher in the high-fertilization rate group than in the low-fertilization rate group, respectively (P < 0.05). The level of apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) gene expression was also higher in the high-fertilization rate group, with a difference of 2.31-fold (P < 0.05). The data were validated through quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. These results confirm the usefulness of the array technique and data mining methods in the discovery of new biomarkers and add knowledge to our understanding of the factors affecting fertilization rates in ovarian follicles.
316	26824840	Light and electron microscopic study of mature spermatozoa from White Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos): an ultrastructural and molecular analysis.	Majhi RK, Kumar A, Yadav M, Kumar P, Maity A, Giri SC, Goswami C	Andrology	 2016 Mar;4(2):232-44	 doi: 101111/andr12130 Epub 2016 Jan 29	The morphology, ultrastructure, and functions of mature avian spermatozoa have been of immense commercial and scientific interest for several reasons. This is mainly important in case of birds in poultry production, conservation, and in the use of sperm morphometry as phylogenetic evidence. Avian spermatozoa share complex or no correlation of sperm morphometry with respect to testis and/or body size as described before. In this work, we have isolated mature spermatozoa from White Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) by non-invasive methods and performed several immunostaining analysis as well as cytochemical analysis using electron and light microscopes. Here, we report the presence of different post-translationally modified tubulin such as tyrosinated-, detyrosinated-, acetylated-, polyglutamylated-, and glycylated-tubulin in specific regions of the mature spermatozoa. By using field-emission scanning electron microscope, we confirm the presence of acrosome-like structure at the tip of the sperm head. However, this structure remains non-reactive to common lectins such as Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) and cholesterol-sensitive dyes such as Filipin. We report that this acrosomal structure is primarily made of lipid-based structures and is resistant to 0.1% Triton X100. Confocal microscopy and super resolution structured illumination microscopy study indicates that the nucleus is bifurcated at the tip region. By using specific markers, we report that the perforatorium structure present at the tip of the spermatozoa head contains specialized organelles that is similar to atypical mitochondria. We propose that these ultrastructural and molecular parameters can be used as species-specific features. The bifurcated nucleus and presence of atypical mitochondria within this structure may be relevant for the complex mitochondrial inheritance and mitochondrial heteroplasmy observed in case of avian population.
317	26824796	Wild Birds in Romania Are More Exposed to West Nile Virus Than to Newcastle Disease Virus.	Pastiu AI, Pap PL, Vagasi CI, Niculae M, Pall E, Domsa C, Brudasca FG, Spinu M	Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis	 2016 Mar;16(3):176-80	 doi: 101089/vbz20151805 Epub 2016 Jan 29	The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of West Nile virus (WNV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in wild and domestic birds from Romania. During 2011-2014, 159 plasma samples from wild birds assigned to 11 orders, 27 families, and 61 species and from 21 domestic birds (Gallus gallus domesticus, Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were collected. The sera were assayed by two commercial competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) kits for antibodies against WNV and NDV. We found a high prevalence of WNV antibodies in both domestic (19.1%) and wild (32.1%) birds captured after the human epidemic in 2010. Moreover, the presence of anti-NDV antibodies among wild birds from Romania (5.4%) was confirmed serologically for the first time, as far as we are aware. Our findings provide evidence that wild birds, especially resident ones are involved in local West Nile and Newcastle disease enzootic and epizootic cycles. These may allow virus maintenance and spread and also enhance the chance of new outbreaks.
318	26819540	Discovering All Transcriptome Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Scanning for Selection Signatures in Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lin R, Du X, Peng S, Yang L, Ma Y, Gong Y, Li S	Evol Bioinform Online	 2015 Dec 1;11(Suppl 1):67-76	 doi: 104137/EBOS21545 eCollection 2015	The duck is one of the most economically important waterfowl as a source of meat, eggs, and feathers. Characterizing the genetic variation in duck species is an important step toward linking genes or genomic regions with phenotypes. Human-driven selection during duck domestication and subsequent breed formation has likely left detectable signatures in duck genome. In this study, we employed a panel of >1.4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 15 duck individuals. The density of the resulting SNPs is significantly positively correlated with the density of genes across the duck genome, which demonstrates that the usage of the RNA-seq data allowed us to enrich variant functional categories, such as coding exons, untranslated regions (UTRs), introns, and downstream/upstream. We performed a complete scan of selection signatures in the ducks using the composite likelihood ratio (CLR) and found 76 candidate regions of selection, many of which harbor genes related to phenotypes relevant to the function of the digestive system and fat metabolism, including TCF7L2, EIF2AK3, ELOVL2, and fatty acid-binding protein family. This study illustrates the potential of population genetic approaches for identifying genomic regions affecting domestication-related phenotypes and further helps to increase the known genetic information about this economically important animal.
319	26818053	Ventilation changes associated with hatching and maturation of an endothermic phenotype in the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos domestica.	Sirsat TS, Dzialowski EM	Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol	 2016 Apr 15;310(8):R766-75	 doi: 101152/ajpregu002742015 Epub 2016 Jan 27	Precocial birds begin embryonic life with an ectothermic metabolic phenotype and rapidly develop an endothermic phenotype after hatching. Switching to a high-energy, endothermic phenotype requires high-functioning respiratory and cardiovascular systems to deliver sufficient environmental oxygen to the tissues. We measured tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency (f), minute ventilation (Ve), and whole-animal oxygen consumption (Vo2) in response to gradual cooling from 37.5 degrees C (externally pipped paranates, EP) or 35 degrees C (hatchlings) to 20 degrees C along with response to hypercapnia during developmental transition from an ectothermic, EP paranate to endothermic hatchling. To examine potential eggshell constraints on EP ventilation, we repeated these experiments in artificially hatched early and late EP paranates. Hatchlings and artificially hatched late EP paranates were able to increase Vo2significantly in response to cooling. EP paranates had high f that decreased with cooling, coupled with an unchanging low VT and did not respond to hypercapnia. Hatchlings had significantly lower f and higher VT and Ve that increased with cooling and hypercapnia. In response to artificial hatching, all ventilation values quickly reached those of hatchlings and responded to hypercapnia. The timing of artificial hatching influenced the temperature response, with only artificially hatched late EP animals, exhibiting the hatchling ventilation response to cooling. We suggest one potential constraint on ventilatory responses of EP paranates is the rigid eggshell, limiting air sac expansion during inhalation and constraining VT Upon natural or artificial hatching, the VT limitation is removed and the animal is able to increase VT, Ve, and thus Vo2, and exhibit an endothermic phenotype.
320	26782512	SNPs in the 5'-regulatory region of the tyrosinase gene do not affect plumage color in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Zhang NN, Hu JW, Liu HH, Xu HY, He H, Li L	Genet Mol Res	 2015 Dec 29;14(4):18623-8	 doi: 104238/2015December2811	Tyrosinase, encoded by the TYR gene, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of melanin pigment. In this study, plumage color separation was observed in Cherry Valley duck line D and F1 and F2 hybrid generations of Liancheng white ducks. Gene sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were applied to the 5'-regulatory region of TYR, to explore the connection between TYR sequence variation and duck plumage color. Four SNPs were found in the 5'-regulatory region. The SNPs were in tight linkage and formed three haplotypes. However, the genotype distribution in groups with different plumage color was not significantly different, and there were no changes in the transcription factor binding sites between the different genotypes. In conclusion, these SNP variations may not cause the differences in feather color observed in this test group.
321	26690963	Influence of grand-mother diet on offspring performances through the male line in Muscovy duck.	Brun JM, Bernadet MD, Cornuez A, Leroux S, Bodin L, Basso B, Davail S, Jaglin M, Lessire M, Martin X, Sellier N, Morisson M, Pitel F	BMC Genet	 2015 Dec 21;16:145	 doi: 101186/s12863-015-0303-z	BACKGROUND: In mammals, multigenerational environmental effects have been documented by either epidemiological studies in human or animal experiments in rodents. Whether such phenomena also occur in birds for more than one generation is still an open question. The objective of this study was to investigate if a methionine deficiency experienced by a mother (G0) could affect her grand-offspring phenotypes (G2 hybrid mule ducks and G2 purebred Muscovy ducks), through their Muscovy sons (G1). Muscovy drakes are used for the production of mule ducks, which are sterile offspring of female common duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and Muscovy drakes (Cairina moschata). In France, mule ducks are bred mainly for the production of "foie gras", which stems from hepatic steatosis under two weeks of force-feeding (FF). Two groups of female Muscovy ducks received either a methionine deficient diet or a control diet. Their sons were mated to Muscovy or to common duck females to produce Muscovy or Mule ducks, respectively. Several traits were measured in the G2 progenies, concerning growth, feed efficiency during FF, body composition after FF, and quality of foie gras and magret. RESULTS: In the G2 mule duck progeny, grand-maternal methionine deficiency (GMMD) decreased 4, 8, and 12 week body weights but increased weight gain and feed efficiency during FF, and abdominal fat weight. The plasmatic glucose and triglyceride contents at the end of FF were higher in the methionine deficient group. In the G2 purebred Muscovy progeny, GMMD tended to decrease 4 week body weight in both sexes, and decreased weight gain between the ages of 4 and 12 weeks, 12 week body weight, and body weight at the end of FF in male offspring only. GMMD tended to increase liver weight and increased the carcass proportion of liver in both sexes. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these results show that the mother's diet is able to affect traits linked to growth and to lipid metabolism in the offspring of her sons, in Muscovy ducks. Whether this transmission through the father of information induced in the grand-mother by the environment is epigenetic remains to be demonstrated.
322	26648768	Structure and antigenicity analysis of the IgG gene for Nyctereutes procyonoides.	Zhao C, Guo S, Pang X, Song D, Fu S, Chang W	Cent Eur J Immunol	 2015;40(3):271-5	 doi: 105114/ceji201554585 Epub 2015 Oct 15	OBJECTIVE: Nyctereutes procyonoides immunoglobulin G (IgG) gene is partially cloned. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to obtain a certain length (966bp) of Nyctereutes procyonoides immunoglobulin G (IgG), two pairs of primers are designed according to the conserved nucleotide sequence of canine (GenBank:AF354265, AF354265, AF354266, AF354267) and mink (GenBank: L07789). Using Bioinformatics technology and Western-blot to analyze antigenicity of Nyctereutes procyonoides IgG-B gene. RESULTS: The homology for nucleotide sequence of IgG between Nyctereutes procyonoides and canine (IgG A, IgG B, IgG C, IgG D), mink, Homo sapiens, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Mus musculus, Anas platyrhynchos and gallus were respectively (88.1%, 93.6%, 85.4%, 87.2%), 83.7%, 74.8%, 71.8%, 69.2%, 51.6%, 48.4%. It can be seen that there was high homology of aminoacid sequence between IgG of Nyctereutes procyonoides and IgG (A, B, C, D) of canine. And the serum antibody of Nyctereutes procyonoides had obviously cross-reaction with HRP conjugated rabbit anti-dog IgG, compared with those of canine, oryctolagus cuniculus, mus musculus, mink, gallus. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully got Nyctereutes procyonoides immuneglobulin G (IgG) gene (Gen- Bank: KM010191). There is the closest ties of consanguinity of IgG exist between Nyctereutes procyonoides and canine among the mammal through the genetic evolution. The detection and treament of canine distemper can be used on Nyctereutes procyonoides.

324	26631753	Phylogenetic analysis of nasal avian schistosomes (Trichobilharzia) from aquatic birds in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran.	Fakhar M, Ghobaditara M, Brant SV, Karamian M, Gohardehi S, Bastani R	Parasitol Int	 2016 Apr;65(2):151-8	 doi: 101016/jparint201511009 Epub 2015 Nov 26	Nasal schistosomes are trematodes in the family Schistosomatidae, many members of which are causative agents of human cercarial dermatitis (HCD). Little is known about the species diversity and distribution of nasal dwelling schistosomes of water birds, particularly in countries outside of Europe; even less is known in countries like Iran. Nasal schistosomes are of particular interest since these species migrate via the central nervous system to the nasal cavity once they penetrate their host. Thus, there must be efforts to determine the incidence of HCD due to nasal schistosomes. HCD outbreaks are reported seasonally in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran, an area well known for rice cultivation leading to increased person contact with water and infected snails. Such places include favorable habitat for both domestic ducks year round, and wild migratory ducks in the winter through spring. Recent reports have detected the presence of both nasal and visceral schistosomes in ducks in this area but with little species characterization. In this study, we examine a diversity of aquatic birds to determine the distribution, prevalence and bird host use of nasal schistosomes. We apply for the first time a molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of these schistosomes. From 2012 to 2014, the nasal cavity of 508 aquatic birds from Mazandaran Province were examined that included species in Anseriformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes and Phoenicopteriformes. Nasal schistosomes were found in 45 (8.9%) birds belonging to Anseriformes (Anas platyrhynchos and Anas clypeata). Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 rDNA and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase1 gene of isolated eggs revealed that all samples grouped in a sister clade to the European Trichobilharzia regenti. However, Trichobilharzia from this study were more similar to a unique haplotype of Trichobilharzia, isolated from the nasals of an A. clypeata in France. The genetic and phenotypic differences between the species found herein and T. regenti from Europe, may prove with additional data to be a distinct species of Trichobilharzia.
325	26630129	Transcriptional Profiling Identifies Location-Specific and Breed-Specific Differentially Expressed Genes in Embryonic Myogenesis in Anas Platyrhynchos.	Zhang RP, Liu HH, Liu JY, Hu JW, Yan XP, Wang DM, Li L, Wang JW	PLoS One	 2015 Dec 2;10(12):e0143378	 doi: 101371/journalpone0143378 eCollection 2015	Skeletal muscle growth and development are highly orchestrated processes involving significant changes in gene expressions. Differences in the location-specific and breed-specific genes and pathways involved have important implications for meat productions and meat quality. Here, RNA-Seq was performed to identify differences in the muscle deposition between two muscle locations and two duck breeds for functional genomics studies. To achieve those goals, skeletal muscle samples were collected from the leg muscle (LM) and the pectoral muscle (PM) of two genetically different duck breeds, Heiwu duck (H) and Peking duck (P), at embryonic 15 days. Functional genomics studies were performed in two experiments: Experiment 1 directly compared the location-specific genes between PM and LM, and Experiment 2 compared the two breeds (H and P) at the same developmental stage (embryonic 15 days). Almost 13 million clean reads were generated using Illumina technology (Novogene, Beijing, China) on each library, and more than 70% of the reads mapped to the Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) genome. A total of 168 genes were differentially expressed between the two locations analyzed in Experiment 1, whereas only 8 genes were differentially expressed when comparing the same location between two breeds in Experiment 2. Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG) were used to functionally annotate DEGs (differentially expression genes). The DEGs identified in Experiment 1 were mainly involved in focal adhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathways (corrected P-value<0.05). In Experiment 2, the DEGs were associated with only the ribosome signaling pathway (corrected P-value<0.05). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm 15 of the differentially expressed genes originally detected by RNA-Seq. A comparative transcript analysis of the leg and pectoral muscles of two duck breeds not only improves our understanding of the location-specific and breed-specific genes and pathways but also provides some candidate molecular targets for increasing muscle products and meat quality by genetic control.
326	26629623	Differential Viral Fitness Between H1N1 and H3N8 Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Ferreira HL, Vangeluwe D, Van Borm S, Poncin O, Dumont N, Ozhelvaci O, Munir M, van den Berg T, Lambrecht B	Avian Dis	 2015 Dec;59(4):498-507	 doi: 101637/11074-033015-Reg	Homosubtypic and heterosubtypic immunity in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) play an important role in the avian influenza virus (AIV) diversity. The mechanisms of AIV replication among wild birds and the role of immunity in AIV diversity have thus not been completely clarified. During the monitoring of AI circulation among wild waterfowl in 2007-2008, two viruses (H3N8 and H1N1) were isolated from ducks caught in a funnel trap located in La Hulpe wetland in Belgium. H3N8 viruses were revealed to be more prevalent in the mallard population than was H1N1, which might suggest a better adaptation to this species. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we characterized both isolated viruses biologically by experimental inoculation. Virus excretion and humoral response induced by both isolated viruses were evaluated in mallards after a first infection followed by a homo- or heterosubtypic reinfection under controlled experimental conditions. The H1N1 virus had a delayed peak of excretion of 4 days compared to the H3N8, but the virus shedding was more limited, earlier, and shorter after each reinfection. Moreover, the H3N8 virus could spread to all ducks after homo- or heterosubtypic reinfections and during a longer period. Although the humoral response induced by both viruses after infection and reinfection could be detected efficiently by competitive ELISA, only a minimal H1 antibody response and almost no H3-specific antibodies could be detected by the HI test. Our results suggest that the H3N8 isolate replicates better in mallards under experimental controlled conditions.
327	26587783	Identification of the Long-Sought Leptin in Chicken and Duck: Expression Pattern of the Highly GC-Rich Avian leptin Fits an Autocrine/Paracrine Rather Than Endocrine Function.	Seroussi E, Cinnamon Y, Yosefi S, Genin O, Smith JG, Rafati N, Bornelov S, Andersson L, Friedman-Einat M	Endocrinology	 2016 Feb;157(2):737-51	 doi: 101210/en2015-1634 Epub 2015 Nov 20	More than 20 years after characterization of the key regulator of mammalian energy balance, leptin, we identified the leptin (LEP) genes of chicken (Gallus gallus) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos). The extreme guanine-cytosine content ( approximately 70%), the location in a genomic region with low-complexity repetitive and palindromic sequence elements, the relatively low sequence conservation, and low level of expression have hampered the identification of these genes until now. In vitro-expressed chicken and duck leptins specifically activated signaling through the chicken leptin receptor in cell culture. In situ hybridization demonstrated expression of LEP mRNA in granular and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, anterior pituitary, and in embryonic limb buds, somites, and branchial arches, suggesting roles in adult brain control of energy balance and during embryonic development. The expression patterns of LEP and the leptin receptor (LEPR) were explored in chicken, duck, and quail (Coturnix japonica) using RNA-sequencing experiments available in the Short Read Archive and by quantitative RT-PCR. In adipose tissue, LEP and LEPR were scarcely transcribed, and the expression level was not correlated to adiposity. Our identification of the leptin genes in chicken and duck genomes resolves a long lasting controversy regarding the existence of leptin genes in these species. This identification was confirmed by sequence and structural similarity, conserved exon-intron boundaries, detection in numerous genomic, and transcriptomic datasets and characterization by PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and bioassays. Our results point to an autocrine/paracrine mode of action for bird leptin instead of being a circulating hormone as in mammals.
328	26576729	Differences in hindlimb morphology of ducks and chickens: effects of domestication and selection.	Duggan BM, Hocking PM, Schwarz T, Clements DN	Genet Sel Evol	 2015 Nov 17;47:88	 doi: 101186/s12711-015-0166-9	BACKGROUND: Poultry account for the most numerous species farmed for meat and have been subject to intense selection over approximately 60 generations. To assess morphological changes which have occurred in the avian leg due to selection for rapid growth and high meat yields, divergent lines of chicken (Gallus gallus) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos) were studied between 3 and 7 weeks of age. For each line, femoral and tibiotarsal morphology was recorded using computed tomography scanning and tibiotarsal bone quality measures (stiffness, bending stress and porosity) were assessed. RESULTS: In chicken and duck, divergence in hindlimb morphology has occurred in the commercial meat lines compared to their lighter conspecifics. As expected, the differences were largest between species. Leg development nears completion much earlier in ducks than in chickens. Duck tibiotarsi showed a large degree of lateral curvature, which is expected to affect foot position during swimming and walking, and thus to influence gait. All lines have adapted their tibiotarsal morphology to suit the loading forces they experience; however bone quality was found to be poorer in chickens. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that intensive selection for growth rate in both chickens and ducks has resulted in leg morphology changes, which are likely to influence gait. Ducks represent an interesting compromise of adaptation for efficient locomotion in two media-on land and in water. Some aspects of bone morphology in the duck, such as lateral curvature of the tibiotarsus, may result from adaptation to swimming, which potentially imposes limitations on terrestrial locomotion.

Vallverdu-Coll N, Mougeot F, Ortiz-Santaliestra ME, Rodriguez-Estival J, Lopez-Antia A, Mateo R	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2016 Jun;35(6):1516-25	 doi: 101002/etc3301 Epub 2016 Mar 18	The ingestion of spent lead (Pb) from ammunition is a known cause of mortality in waterfowl, but little is known about sublethal effects produced by Pb poisoning on birds, especially in wild populations. The authors studied potential sublethal effects associated with Pb exposure in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from the Ebro delta (northeastern Spain) after a ban on Pb ammunition. They analyzed the relationships between blood Pb levels and oxidative stress, immune response, and carotenoid-based coloration, which are known to be influenced by oxidative stress. Levels of Pb were reduced by half from 6 yr to 9 yr after the ban. Lipid peroxidation was positively related to Pb levels in females. The delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity was suppressed by Pb exposure and negatively associated with the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Carotenoid levels were positively associated with blood Pb concentration in both sexes, and males with higher Pb levels presented a less intense coloration in legs and beak. Levels of Pb were positively related to hemolytic activity of circulating immune system components and negatively related to lysozyme levels. In summary, Pb exposure was associated in a gender-specific way with increased oxidative stress, consequences on color expression, and impaired constitutive immunity. In females, antioxidants seemed to be allocated mostly in reproduction rather than in self-maintenance, whereas males seemed to better maintain oxidative balance to the detriment of coloration.

330	26436390	Effects of Pax3 and Pax7 expression on muscle mass in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Wang Y, Zhang RP, Zhao YM, Li QQ, Yan XP, Liu JY, Gou H, Li L	Genet Mol Res	 2015 Sep 28;14(3):11495-504	 doi: 104238/2015September281	This study aimed to investigate whether the differential expression of muscle development-related genes is one of the reasons why muscle development differs between Pekin, Jianchang, and Heiwu ducks, which are all domesticated duck breeds (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) breeds. At 2 weeks of age, the RNA expression of paired box 7 (Pax7), paired box 3 (Pax3), myogenic differentiation antigen (MYOD), and myogenin (MYOG) genes were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Pax3 and Pax7 protein levels were detected by western blot assay. Myofiber morphology was investigated using paraffin-embedded muscle sections. At 8 weeks of age, 30 ducks of each breed were slaughtered for meat quality determination. The results revealed that Pax3 and Pax7 expression levels at both the RNA and protein levels were high in the Pekin duck. In addition, MYOG expression levels in the Jianchang duck were significantly higher than in the other two duck breeds (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in MYOD expression levels between the breeds (P > 0.05). Myofiber diameter and cross-sectional area were the largest in the Pekin duck and the smallest in the Heiwu duck. There were significant differences in slaughter data between these breeds, and muscle content was greatest in the Pekin duck. The results indicate that the muscle content of three different duck breeds is associated with the expression of satellite-cell marker genes.
331	26414437	Speciation genomics and a role for the Z chromosome in the early stages of divergence between Mexican ducks and mallards.	Lavretsky P, Dacosta JM, Hernandez-Banos BE, Engilis A Jr, Sorenson MD, Peters JL	Mol Ecol	 2015 Nov;24(21):5364-78	 doi: 101111/mec13402 Epub 2015 Oct 21	Speciation is a continuous and dynamic process, and studying organisms during the early stages of this process can aid in identifying speciation mechanisms. The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Mexican duck (A. [p.] diazi) are two recently diverged taxa with a history of hybridization and controversial taxonomy. To understand their evolutionary history, we conducted genomic scans to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and divergence across the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region, 3523 autosomal loci and 172 Z-linked sex chromosome loci. Between the two taxa, Z-linked loci (PhiST = 0.088) were 5.2 times more differentiated than autosomal DNA (PhiST = 0.017) but comparable to mtDNA (PhiST = 0.092). This elevated Z differentiation deviated from neutral expectations inferred from simulated data that incorporated demographic history and differences in effective population sizes between marker types. Furthermore, 3% of Z-linked loci, compared to <0.1% of autosomal loci, were detected as outlier loci under divergent selection with elevated relative (PhiST ) and absolute (dXY ) estimates of divergence. In contrast, the ratio of Z-linked and autosomal differentiation among the seven Mexican duck sampling locations was close to 1:1 (PhiST = 0.018 for both markers). We conclude that between mallards and Mexican ducks, divergence at autosomal markers is largely neutral, whereas greater divergence on the Z chromosome (or some portions thereof) is likely the product of selection that has been important in speciation. Our results contribute to a growing body of literature indicating elevated divergence on the Z chromosome and its likely importance in avian speciation.

Binkowski LJ, Przystupinska A, Wojtas W	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	 2016 Feb;96(2):173-8	 doi: 101007/s00128-015-1657-7 Epub 2015 Sep 25	The distribution of total mercury in the bodies of drake mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) inhabiting an industrialized wetland area in southern Poland was studied. The median Hg concentration in tissue of various bones (0.017 microg/g w.w.) was statistically lower than the concentration found in muscle tissue (0.023 microg/g w.w.) and in internal organ tissue samples calculated across the whole range of organ types (0.036 microg/g w.w.). The median concentrations in muscle tissue and organ tissue were comparable. Significant differences within the examined bones were observed, with the beak accumulating the highest amount (0.105 microg/g w.w.). Concentrations were comparable in tissue from various muscles, whereas internal organ tissue displayed a significant variation. The highest median concentration was detected in the kidneys (0.109 microg/g w.w.). Correlations of Hg concentrations between major groups of tissue (i.e. bone, muscle and internal organs) were not statistically significant, but several significant relationships were noted between internal organs.
333	26400374	When fur and feather occur together: interclass transmission of avian influenza A virus from mammals to birds through common resources.	Root JJ, Shriner SA, Ellis JW, VanDalen KK, Sullivan HJ, Franklin AB	Sci Rep	 2015 Sep 24;5:14354	 doi: 101038/srep14354	The potential role of wild mammals in avian influenza A virus (IAV) transmission cycles has received some attention in recent years and cases where birds have transmitted IAV to mammals have been documented. However, the contrasting cycle, wherein a mammal could transmit an avian IAV to birds, has been largely overlooked. We experimentally tested the abilities of two mammalian species to transmit avian IAV to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in simulated natural environments. Results suggested that striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) can successfully transmit avian IAV to mallards through indirect contact with shared resources, as transmission was noted in 1 of 4 of the mallards tested. Cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.) exhibited a similar pattern, as one of five cottontail rabbits successfully transmitted IAV to a mallard, likely through environmental contamination. For each mammalian species tested, the mallards that became infected were those paired with the individual mammals with the lowest shedding levels but were anecdotally observed to be the most active animals. Mammals associated with and around poultry rearing facilities should be taken into consideration in biosecurity plans.
334	26398920	Hemodynamics of the pectinis oculi artery in American pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Ferreira TA, Turner Giannico A, Montiani-Ferreira F	Vet Ophthalmol	 2016 Sep;19(5):409-13	 doi: 101111/vop12316 Epub 2015 Sep 23	OBJECTIVE: To measure blood velocity parameters of the main detectable branch of the pectinis oculi artery and compare with values found in other arteries in other species to form a hypothesis of the function of the pecten oculi in birds. METHODS: Eleven American pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) without ocular diseases were examined with ocular Doppler ultrasonography. The pectinate artery resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were calculated. RESULTS: The mean of RI and PI values resulted, respectively, in: left eye (0.43 +/- 0.07; 0.58 +/- 0.13), right eye (0.37 +/- 0.09; 0.47 +/- 0.14), and both eyes (0.40 +/- 0.08; 0.53 +/- 0.14). DISCUSSION: The low RI and PI values found in the main branch of the pectinis oculi artery compared with other arteries in other tissues suggest a high metabolic activity in the pecten oculi, and it could indicate a nutritional function and/or intraocular pressure regulation.

Blasco-Costa I, Poulin R, Presswell B	Parasitol Res	 2016 Jan;115(1):271-89	 doi: 101007/s00436-015-4744-0 Epub 2015 Sep 18	Species of Apatemon Szidat, 1928 and Australapatemon Sudarikov, 1959 are reported from New Zealand for the first time, and their life cycles are resolved using molecular sequence data (28S and ITS rDNA regions and mitochondrial COI). The metacercaria of Apatemon sp. 'jamiesoni' ex Gobiomorphus cotidianus and its cercaria ex Potamopyrgus antipodarum are described in detail. Its adult, found in Anas platyrhynchos and Phalacrocorax punctatus, is identified by molecular sequence data. Apatemon sp. 'jamiesoni' uses a different species of snail host, exhibits consistent differences in the genetic markers examined and its single described adult differs from known species so as to be considered distinct, but its formal description awaits additional adult specimens. Australapatemon niewiadomski n. sp. is described from Anas platyrhynchos. It is distinguished morphologically by the absence of a ringnapf and its overall smaller size compared to most other Australapatemon spp. except Au. magnacetabulum and Au. minor, which are smaller in nearly all features than the new species. Au. niewiadomski n. sp. metacercaria and its intermediate host (Barbronia weberi) are identified via matching of molecular sequence data. The status of Apatemon and Australapatemon as distinct genera is confirmed based on their respective monophyly, and genetic divergence between them is comparable to other well-established genera in the Strigeidae. The diagnosis of Australapatemon is emended. Life history data, accurate patterns of host specialisation and distribution, alongside concurrent molecular and morphological evidence would be useful for an integrative taxonomical approach towards the elucidation of species diversity in this group.
336	26385336	Dietary calcium deficiency in laying ducks impairs eggshell quality by suppressing shell biomineralization.	Chen W, Zhao F, Tian ZM, Zhang HX, Ruan D, Li Y, Wang S, Zheng CT, Lin YC	J Exp Biol	 2015 Oct;218(Pt 20):3336-43	 doi: 101242/jeb124347 Epub 2015 Sep 18	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary calcium deficiency on the process of shell formation. Four hundred and fifty female ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) at 22 weeks were randomly assigned to three groups. Ducks were fed one of two calcium-deficient diets (containing 1.8% or 0.38% calcium, respectively) or a calcium-adequate control diet (containing 3.6% calcium) for 67 days (depletion period) and then all ducks were fed a calcium-adequate diet for an additional 67 days (repletion period). Compared with the calcium-adequate control, the average shell thickness, egg shell weight, breaking strength, mammillae density and mammillary knob thickness of shell from ducks that consumed the diet with 0.38% calcium were significantly decreased (P<0.05) during the depletion period, accompanied by reduced tibia quality. The mRNA expression of both secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) in the uterus was decreased after feeding calcium-deficient diets (1.8% or 0.38% calcium). mRNA transcripts of calbindin 1 (CALB1), an important protein responsible for calcium transport, and the matrix protein genes ovocalyxin-32 (OCX-32) and ovocleidin-116 (OC-116) were reduced in ducks fed 0.38% calcium but not 1.8% calcium. Plasma estradiol concentration was decreased by both of the calcium-deficient diets (P<0.05). The impaired shell quality and suppressed functional proteins involved in shell formation could be reversed by repletion of dietary calcium. The results of the present study suggest that dietary calcium deficiency negatively affects eggshell quality and microarchitecture, probably by suppressing shell biomineralization.

Ahmad A, Gupta N, Saxena AK, Gupta DK	J Parasit Dis	 2015 Sep;39(3):567-71	 doi: 101007/s12639-013-0398-y Epub 2013 Nov 19	Three phthirapteran species (two Ischnocera and one Amblycera) were recovered from hundred ducks in district Bareilly and Rampur during 2011-2012. Prevalence of Anaticola crassicornis was comparatively higher (31 %) than that of Anatoecus dentatus (16 %) and Holomenpon leucoxanthum (28 %). However, the intensity of infestation of H. leucoxanthum (22.89) remained higher than the other two species. Distribution pattern of all lice were skewed but negative binomial model was not found to be a good fit. Sex ratios of all three species were skewed in favour of females (A. crassicornis-1:1.23, H. leucoxanthum-1:1.19, A. dentatus-1:1.72) and nymphal population exceeded the adult population (A. crassicornis-1:1.26, H. leucoxanthum-1:1.12, A. dentatus-1:1.61).
338	26342465	Phylogenetic and pathogenic characterization of novel adenoviruses isolated from long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis).	Counihan KL, Skerratt LF, Franson JC, Hollmen TE	Virology	 2015 Nov;485:393-401	 doi: 101016/jvirol201507026 Epub 2015 Sep 2	Novel adenoviruses were isolated from a long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) mortality event near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in 2000. The long-tailed duck adenovirus genome was approximately 27 kb. A 907 bp hexon gene segment was used to design primers specific for the long-tailed duck adenovirus. Nineteen isolates were phylogenetically characterized based on portions of their hexon gene and 12 were most closely related to Goose adenovirus A. The remaining 7 shared no hexon sequences with any known adenoviruses. Experimental infections of mallards with a long-tailed duck reference adenovirus caused mild lymphoid infiltration of the intestine and paint brush hemorrhages of the mucosa and dilation of the intestine. This study shows novel adenoviruses from long-tailed ducks are diverse and provides further evidence that they should be considered in cases of morbidity and mortality in sea ducks. Conserved and specific primers have been developed that will help screen sea ducks for adenoviral infections.

Lebedeva DI, Yakovleva GA, Ieshko EP	Parasitol Res	 2015 Oct;114(10):3935-7	 doi: 101007/s00436-015-4697-3 Epub 2015 Sep 2	There are first data on nematodes of Anas platyrhynchos Linnaeus, 1758 (mallard) and Bucephala clangula Linnaeus, 1758 (common goldeneye) from Northern Europe (Ladoga Lake region). The ducks were found to be infected with nine nematode species. A. platyrhynchos hosted eight nematode species and B. clangula was host to four nematode species. All species except Capillaria anatis were found in the region for the first time. Nematodes Amidostomum acutum, Streptocara crassicauda, and Tetrameres fissispina parasitized on both hosts and were the most abundant. The biggest number of parasites revealed was biohelminths with a direct life cycle.
340	26292258	Molecular detection and genotypic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii in wild waterfowls in Jilin Province, Northeastern China.	Zhang FK, Wang HJ, Qin SY, Wang ZD, Lou ZL, Zhu XQ, Liu Q	Parasitol Int	 2015 Dec;64(6):576-8	 doi: 101016/jparint201508008 Epub 2015 Aug 17	Toxoplasma gondii can infect almost warm-blooded animals, including humans. Limited information about T. gondii infection in wild waterfowls is available in China. The present study was conducted to determine prevalence and genotype T. gondii infection in 11 wild waterfowl species in Jilin Province, northeastern China. A total of 249 wild waterfowls were sampled between April and July 2013 from Jilin Province, and the tissue samples were collected for the detection of T. gondii by a semi-nested PCR targeting the B1 gene. The positive samples were genotyped at 11 genetic markers (SAG1, 5'- and 3'-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, c22-8, c29-2, and Apico) using multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology. The overall prevalence of T. gondii in the wild waterfowls was 7.2% (18/249, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0-10.4), with the highest prevalence (22.0%, 95% CI 10.5-33.5) in Anas formosa, followed by Anas platyrhynchos (20.0%, 95% CI 6.0-44.0), Falcated teal (12.5%, 95% CI 0.0-35.4), and Fulica atra (4.0%, 95% CI 0.0-11.7). Of 18 positive samples, only 2 samples (TgWfjl1 and TgWfjl2) were genotyped completely, and one genotype, namely ToxoDB #9, was revealed. The result of this survey has implications for better understanding of the genetic diversity of T. gondii in China. This is the first report of prevalence and genotypic characterization of T. gondii in wild waterfowls in northeastern China.
341	26218061	Cloning, expression, and polymorphism at the 5'-flanking region of the GnRH gene and their association with laying traits in Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata).	Wu X, Wan XP, Lan JJ, Yan MJ, Lian SY, Rijal M, Huang ZB, Li A	Br Poult Sci	 2015;56(5):531-42	 doi: 101080/0007166820151077502	Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a neuropeptide, plays a vital role in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In vertebrates, GnRH is crucial for the onset of sexual development and the entire reproductive process. The purpose of this study was to identify genetic factors associated with egg-laying traits of Muscovy ducks. The full-length cDNA (474 bp) of Muscovy duck GnRH was obtained and characterised. It encodes 92 amino acids containing a 1-amino acid signal peptide cleavage site. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Muscovy duck GnRH has a close relationship with Anas platyrhynchos GnRH. GnRH showed significantly different expression profiles between 4 developmental periods in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary. The expression of GnRH in the laying period (36 weeks) was higher than at other periods in the three tissues. GnRH was widely expressed in 12 examined tissues of nesting and laying Muscovy ducks. In the hypothalamus, pituitary and gonads, the expression of GnRH was higher than in other tissues. In laying Muscovy ducks, the expression of GnRH in the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, muscular stomach, pancreas, heart, duodenum and spleen was significantly higher than in nesting dusks. Differences were detected in the liver and glandular stomach between laying ducks and nesting ducks. Differences between the kidney and lung were not significant. In the pituitary, the GnRH and GnRH receptor (GnRHR) genes shared the same expression profiles during 4 time points. Both genes had the highest expression at 36 weeks of age. A mutation (g.206G > A) in the 5'-flanking region was associated with egg-laying performance. Individuals with genotype GG had better egg-laying performance than the individuals with genotype AA. GnRH may be used as a marker gene for laying performance in the Muscovy duck.
342	26141923	Study on Metal Concentrations in Tissues of Mallard and Pochard from Two Major Wintering Sites in Southeastern Caspian Sea, Iran.	Sinka-Karimi MH, Pourkhabbaz AR, Hassanpour M, Levengood JM	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	 2015 Sep;95(3):292-7	 doi: 101007/s00128-015-1591-8 Epub 2015 Jul 4	We examined concentrations of cadmium, chromium, iron, lead and zinc in the kidney, liver, and pectoral muscle of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos; n = 30) and Pochards (Aythya ferina; n = 30) from two important wintering sites in the southeastern Caspian Sea in the winter of 2012. Mean lead concentrations (microg g(-1) ww) in livers (2.36 +/- 1.00) of Pochard and in kidneys (3.43 +/- 0.91) of Mallard exceeded the exposure threshold levels in liver (1.5 microg g(-1) ww) and kidney (3 microg g(-1) ww) of waterfowl. Mean cadmium concentrations in livers (1.63 +/- 0.66) of Pochards exceeded the background level of this metal in liver (1 microg g(-1) ww) of waterfowl. Chromium, iron and zinc concentrations were within the normal range as reported in other duck studies. Gender-related and inter-specific variation of metal concentrations in analyzed tissues were observed (t test, p < 0.05). Our results indicated that waterfowl using the Miankalah and Gomishan International Wetlands are being exposed to elevated concentrations of cadmium and lead.
343	26123724	Altered immune response in mallard ducklings exposed to lead through maternal transfer in the wild.	Vallverdu-Coll N, Lopez-Antia A, Martinez-Haro M, Ortiz-Santaliestra ME, Mateo R	Environ Pollut	 2015 Oct;205:350-6	 doi: 101016/jenvpol201506014 Epub 2015 Jun 28	Lead (Pb) poisoning has caused significant mortality in waterfowl populations worldwide. In spite of having been banned since 2003, prevalence of Pb shot ingestion in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from the Ebro delta was still 15.5% in 2011-12. We collected mallard eggs from this area to study the effects of maternally transferred Pb on eggshell properties and on immune response and oxidative balance of ducklings. Eggshell Pb levels were positively correlated with Pb levels in the blood of ducklings. Ducklings with blood Pb levels above 180 ng mL(-1) showed reduced body mass and died during the first week post hatching. Blood Pb levels positively correlated with humoral immune response, endogenous antioxidants and oxidative stress biomarkers, and negatively correlated with cellular immune response. Pb shot ingestion in birds can result in maternal transfer to the offspring that can affect their developing immune system and reduce their survival in early life stages.
344	26121948	Waterfowl foraging in winter-flooded ricefields: Any agronomic benefits for farmers-	Brogi A, Pernollet CA, Gauthier-Clerc M, Guillemain M	Ambio	 2015 Dec;44(8):793-802	 doi: 101007/s13280-015-0678-0 Epub 2015 Jun 30	Winter-flooding of ricefields provides foraging habitat to waterfowl, which in return may bring agronomic benefits to farmers. Our study experimentally tested the effect of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) on the standing stalks and weed seed bank in the Camargue (France), both of which present major challenges for farmers. Three duck densities were tested: (D1) 5 ducks ha(-1) (historical nocturnal density), (D2) 23 ducks ha(-1) (present nocturnal density), and (D3) 300 ducks ha(-1) (Asian rice-duck farming density). The ducks reduced the stalks significantly: -27 % (D1), -52 % (D2), and -91 % (D3). Conversely, they decreased the number of seeds by only 3 % (D3) and the seed mass by about 21 % (D1 and D3), which was not significant. Besides they had no effect on seed species richness. This study clearly demonstrates that the winter-flooding effect on straw decomposition can be enhanced by waterfowl foraging, hence showing an agronomic benefit from ducks to farmers. However, there was no clear effect in terms of seed bank reduction.
345	26077257	Influenza A(H7N9) virus acquires resistance-related neuraminidase I222T substitution when infected mallards are exposed to low levels of oseltamivir in water.	Gillman A, Nykvist M, Muradrasoli S, Soderstrom H, Wille M, Daggfeldt A, Brojer C, Waldenstrom J, Olsen B, Jarhult JD	Antimicrob Agents Chemother	 2015 Sep;59(9):5196-202	 doi: 101128/AAC00886-15 Epub 2015 Jun 15	Influenza A virus (IAV) has its natural reservoir in wild waterfowl, and new human IAVs often contain gene segments originating from avian IAVs. Treatment options for severe human influenza are principally restricted to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), among which oseltamivir is stockpiled in preparedness for influenza pandemics. There is evolutionary pressure in the environment for resistance development to oseltamivir in avian IAVs, as the active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) passes largely undegraded through sewage treatment to river water where waterfowl reside. In an in vivo mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) model, we tested if low-pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) virus might become resistant if the host was exposed to low levels of OC. Ducks were experimentally infected, and OC was added to their water, after which infection and transmission were maintained by successive introductions of uninfected birds. Daily fecal samples were tested for IAV excretion, genotype, and phenotype. Following mallard exposure to 2.5 mug/liter OC, the resistance-related neuraminidase (NA) I222T substitution, was detected within 2 days during the first passage and was found in all viruses sequenced from subsequently introduced ducks. The substitution generated 8-fold and 2.4-fold increases in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for OC (P < 0.001) and zanamivir (P = 0.016), respectively. We conclude that OC exposure of IAV hosts, in the same concentration magnitude as found in the environment, may result in amino acid substitutions, leading to changed antiviral sensitivity in an IAV subtype that can be highly pathogenic to humans. Prudent use of oseltamivir and resistance surveillance of IAVs in wild birds are warranted.
346	26057008	Phylogenetic studies of two Anas platyrhynchos (Anatini: Anatinae) in Hunan province of China based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences.	He X, Lin Q, Cao R, Yuan YT, Pan DZ, Yun L, Zhang SR, Hou DX	Mitochondrial DNA A DNA Mapp Seq Anal	 2016 Jul;27(4):2462-3	 doi: 103109/1940173620151033698 Epub 2015 Jun 9	In this study, we cloned and sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNAs of Chinese duck, Anas platyrhynchos, population from two different areas of Hunan province in China. The Anas platyrhynchos breed Linwu duck (LW) sample was taken from the Linwu county of Chenzhou city, and the Anas platyrhynchos breed Youxian duck (YX) sample was taken from the Youxian county of Zhuzhou city. The lengths of their complete mitochondrial genome were 16,604 bp (LW) and 16,606 bp (YX), respectively. The organization of the two Anas platyrhynchos breed mitochondrial genomes was similar to those reported from other duck mitochondrial genomes. Phylogenetic analyses using N-J computational algorithms showed that the analyzed species are divided into four major clades: Anatinae, Anserinae, Dendrocygninae and Anseranatidae. Also, the Linwu duck and Youxian duck have highly similar phylogenetic relationship.
347	25978558	High-value utilization of egg shell to synthesize Silver and Gold-Silver core shell nanoparticles and their application for the degradation of hazardous dyes from aqueous phase-A green approach.	Sinha T, Ahmaruzzaman M	J Colloid Interface Sci	 2015 Sep 1;453:115-131	 doi: 101016/jjcis201504053 Epub 2015 May 7	The common household material, egg shell of Anas platyrhynchos is utilized for the synthesis of Silver and Gold-Silver core shell nanoparticles using greener, environment friendly and economic way. The egg shell extracts were acting as a stabilizing and reducing agents. This method avoids the use of external reducing and stabilizing agents, templates and solvents. The effects of various reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature, concentration in the formation of nanoparticles have also been investigated. The compositional abundance of gelatin may be envisaged for the effective reductive as well as stabilizing potency. The mechanisms for the formation of NPs have also been presented. The synthesized Ag NPs formed were predominantly spherical in nature with an average size of particles in the range of 6-26 nm. While, Au-Ag core shell nanoparticles formed were spherical and oval shaped, within a narrow size spectrum of 9-18 nm. Both the Ag NPs Au-and Ag core shell nanoparticles showed characteristic Bragg's reflection planes of fcc structure and surface plasmon resonance at 430 nm and 365 nm, respectively. The NPs were utilized for the removal of toxic and hazardous dyes, such as Rose Bengal, Methyl Violet 6 B and Methylene Blue from aqueous phase. Approximately 98.2%, 98.4% and 97% degradations of Rose Bengal, Methyl Violet 6 B, and Methylene Blue were observed with Ag NPs, while the percentage degradation of these dyes was 97.3%, 97.6% and 96% with Au-Ag NPs, respectively. Therefore, the present study has opened up an innovative way for synthesizing Ag NPs and Au-Ag bimetallic nanostructures of different morphologies and sizes involving the utilization of egg shell extract. The high efficiency of the NPs as photocatalysts has opened a promising application for the removal of hazardous dyes from the industrial effluents.
348	25955279	Endothelin Receptor B2 (EDNRB2) Gene Is Associated with Spot Plumage Pattern in Domestic Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Li L, Li D, Liu L, Li S, Feng Y, Peng X, Gong Y	PLoS One	 2015 May 8;10(5):e0125883	 doi: 101371/journalpone0125883 eCollection 2015	Endothelin receptor B subtype 2 (EDNRB2) is a seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor. In this study, we investigated EDNRB2 gene as a candidate gene for duck spot plumage pattern according to studies of chicken and Japanese quail. The entire coding region was cloned by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis showed that duck EDNRB2 cDNA contained a 1311 bp open reading frame and encoded a putative protein of 436 amino acids residues. The transcript shared 89%-90% identity with the counterparts in other avian species. A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences showed that duck EDNRB2 was evolutionary conserved in avian clade. The entire coding region of EDNRB2 were sequenced in 20 spot and 20 non-spot ducks, and 13 SNPs were identified. Two of them (c.940G>A and c.995G>A) were non-synonymous substitutions, and were genotyped in 647 ducks representing non-spot and spot phenotypes. The c.995G>A mutation, which results in the amino acid substitution of Arg332His, was completely associated with the spot phenotype: all 152 spot ducks were carriers of the AA genotype and the other 495 individuals with non-spot phenotype were carriers of GA or GG genotype, respectively. Segregation in 17 GAxGG and 22 GAxGA testing combinations confirmed this association since the segregation ratios and genotypes of the offspring were in agreement with the hypothesis. In order to investigate the underlying mechanism of the spot phenotype, MITF gene was used as cell type marker of melanocyte progenitor cells while TYR and TYRP1 gene were used as cell type markers of mature melanocytes. Transcripts of MITF, TYR and TYRP1 gene with expected size were identified in all pigmented skin tissues while PCR products were not obtained from non-pigmented skin tissues. It was inferred that melanocytes are absent in non-pigmented skin tissues of spot ducks.
349	25917302	Transcriptome analysis of adiposity in domestic ducks by transcriptomic comparison with their wild counterparts.	Chen L, Luo J, Li JX, Li JJ, Wang DQ, Tian Y, Lu LZ	Anim Genet	 2015 Jun;46(3):299-307	 doi: 101111/age12294	Excessive adiposity is a major problem in the duck industry, but its molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Genetic comparisons between domestic and wild animals have contributed to the exploration of genetic mechanisms responsible for many phenotypic traits. Significant differences in body fat mass have been detected between domestic and wild ducks. In this study, we used the Peking duck and Anas platyrhynchos as the domestic breed and wild counterpart respectively and performed a transcriptomic comparison of abdominal fat between the two breeds to comprehensively analyze the transcriptome basis of adiposity in ducks. We obtained approximately 350 million clean reads; assembled 61 250 transcripts, including 23 699 novel ones; and identified alternative 5' splice sites, alternative 3' splice sites, skipped exons and retained intron as the main alternative splicing events. A differential expression analysis between the two breeds showed that 753 genes exhibited differential expression. In Peking ducks, some lipid metabolism-related genes (IGF2, FABP5, BMP7, etc.) and oncogenes (RRM2, AURKA, CYR61, etc.) were upregulated, whereas genes related to tumor suppression and immunity (TNFRSF19, TNFAIP6, IGSF21, NCF1, etc.) were downregulated, suggesting adiposity might closely associate with tumorigenesis in ducks. Furthermore, 280 576 single-nucleotide variations were found differentiated between the two breeds, including 8641 non-synonymous ones, and some of the non-synonymous ones were found enriched in genes involved in lipid-associated and immune-associated pathways, suggesting abdominal fat of the duck undertakes both a metabolic function and immune-related function. These datasets enlarge our genetic information of ducks and provide valuable resources for analyzing mechanisms underlying adiposity in ducks.
350	25898784	Exploratory behavior is associated with plasma carotenoid accumulation in two congeneric species of waterfowl.	Rowe M, Pierson KL, McGraw KJ	Behav Processes	 2015 Jun;115:181-90	 doi: 101016/jbeproc201504008 Epub 2015 Apr 18	Recently, carotenoid pigments have received considerable attention as modulators of animal health and performance. While studies show that elevated carotenoid intake and accumulation can influence activities like parental care and escape-flight performance, little is known of how carotenoid status influences the expression of animal personality traits, which can be energy-demanding and entail survival costs but also rewarding in the context of foraging and mating. We experimentally investigated the effects of carotenoid availability on exploratory behavior and activity level, using adult males and females of two species of waterfowl: mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail (Anas acuta). We assessed behavior using a novel-environment test designed to measure an individual's response to novel objects and a potential predator threat (fox urine scent). We found that carotenoid availability was positively associated with some aspects of exploratory behavior: birds with higher concentrations of circulating carotenoids entered the test arena sooner and approached and entered predator-scented bedding material more frequently than birds with low carotenoid concentrations. These results suggest that the availability of carotenoid resources can influence personality traits in waterfowl, and we discuss putative physiological mechanisms underlying this effect.
351	25847706	Genetic admixture supports an ancient hybrid origin of the endangered Hawaiian duck.	Lavretsky P, Engilis A Jr, Eadie JM, Peters JL	J Evol Biol	 2015 May;28(5):1005-15	 doi: 101111/jeb12637 Epub 2015 Apr 29	Speciation is regarded primarily as a bifurcation from an ancestral species into two distinct taxonomic units, but gene flow can create complex signals of phylogenetic relationships, especially among different loci. We evaluated several hypotheses that could account for phylogenetic discord between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nuDNA) within Hawaiian duck (Anas wyvilliana), including stochastic lineage sorting, mtDNA capture and widespread genomic introgression. Our results best support the hypothesis that the contemporary Hawaiian duck is descended from an ancient hybridization event between the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis). Whereas mtDNA clearly shows a sister relationship between Hawaiian duck and mallard, nuDNA is consistent with a genetic mosaic with nearly equal contributions from Laysan duck and mallard. In addition, coalescent analyses suggest that gene flow from either mallard or Laysan duck, depending on the predefined tree topology, is necessary to explain contemporary genetic diversity in Hawaiian ducks, and these estimates are more consistent with ancient, rather than contemporary, hybridization. Time since divergence estimates suggest that the genetic admixture event occurred around the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, which is further supported by circumstantial evidence from the Hawaiian subfossil record. Although the extent of reproductive isolation from either putative parental taxon is not currently known, these species are phenotypically, genetically and ecologically different, and they meet primary criteria used in avian taxonomy for species designation. Thus, the available data are consistent with an admixed origin and support the hypothesis that the Hawaiian duck may represent a young hybrid species.
352	25843471	Mycotic Keratitis in a Khaki Campbell Duck ( Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Sadar MJ, Guzman DS, Burton AG, Byrne BA, Wiggans KT, Hollingsworth SR	J Avian Med Surg	 2014 Dec;28(4):322-9	 doi: 101647/2013-050	A 1.5-year-old, intact female khaki Campbell duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) was evaluated for lethargy and a swollen left eye (OS). Mucoid discharge, chemosis, and conjunctival hyperemia with trace aqueous flare, indicating anterior uveitis, in the anterior chamber were evident on ophthalmic examination. There was no fluorescein stain uptake by the cornea. Initial topical antibiotic therapy and systemic anti-inflammatory treatments were unsuccessful, and the lesion progressed to a diffuse, yellow-white plaque, which covered 90%-95% of the cornea 4 days later. There was moderate blepharospasm, mild blepharedema, and epiphora OS. The mobility of the nictitating membrane was impaired because of the presence of the plaque over the cornea. Cytologic examination of a corneal scraping revealed fungal hyphae, and aerobic culture confirmed Aspergillus species. Treatment with topical voriconazole (1 drop OS q4h-q6h) was initiated and was switched to oral voriconazole (20 mg/kg PO q12h) 6 days after initiating treatment. The ocular disease improved during the antifungal treatment period. Eighty-four days after initial presentation (9 days after discontinuation of treatment), there was no clinical evidence of mycotic keratitis on ophthalmic examination.
353	25816333	Identification and expression analysis of the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5) gene in duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Wang B, Chen Y, Mu C, Su Y, Liu R, Huang Z, Li Y, Yu Q, Chang G, Xu Q, Chen G	PLoS One	 2015 Mar 27;10(3):e0121065	 doi: 101371/journalpone0121065 eCollection 2015	The interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) protein family mediates antiviral effects by inhibiting translation initiation, cell proliferation, and migration in the interferon (IFN) dependent innate immune system. Several members of this family, including IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5, have been heavily studied in mammals. Avian species contain only one family member, IFIT5, and little is known about the role of this protein in birds. In this study, duck IFIT5 (duIFIT5) full-length mRNA was cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). Based on the sequence obtained, we performed a series of bioinformatics analyses, and found that duIFIT5 was most similar to homologs in other avian species. Also, duIFIT5 contained eight conserved TPR motifs and two conserved multi-domains (TPR_11 and TPR_12). Finally, we used duck hepatitis virus type 1 (DHV-1) and polyriboinosinicpolyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) as a pathogen or a pathogen-associated molecular pattern induction to infect three-day-old domestic ducklings. The liver and spleen were collected to detect the change in duIFIT5 transcript level upon infection by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). DuIFIT5 expression rapidly increased after DHV-1 infection and maintained a high level, while the transcripts of duIFIT5 peaked at 8h after poly (I:C) infection and then returned to normal. Taken together, these results provide a greater understanding of avian IFIT5.
354	25724855	Integrative taxonomy of central European parasitic flatworms of the family Prosthogonimidae Luhe, 1909 (Trematoda: Plagiorchiida).	Heneberg P, Sitko J, Bizos J	Parasitol Int	 2015 Oct;64(5):264-73	 doi: 101016/jparint201502003 Epub 2015 Feb 25	Species of the family Prosthogonimidae are considered the most pathogenic poultry trematodes worldwide, affecting particularly low intensity farming in rural areas. Adults of Prosthogonimus occur mainly in the bursa of Fabricius, oviduct and cloaca of ducks, geese, fowl and other birds feeding at least occasionally on dragonflies or damselflies (Odonata). We analyzed the central European species of the Prosthogonimidae, namely Prosthogonimus cuneatus, Prosthogonimus ovatus, Prosthogonimus pellucidus and Prosthogonimus rarus. We sequenced three nuclear (ITS2) and mitochondrial (CO1, ND1) DNA loci of four species isolated from Anas clypeata, Anas strepera, Anas platyrhynchos, Aythya ferina, Passer domesticus and Turdus merula. Intra- and inter-specific sequence variability revealed that all four species represent distinct well-defined entities. Our data, combined with previously published studies, suggest the return of the name Prosthogonimus rarus Braun, 1901 for Schistogonimus rarus (Braun, 1901). The genus name Schistogonimus Luhe, 1909 is considered a junior synonym of Prosthogonimus Luhe, 1899. We identified the existence of two clades, one represented by P. cuneatus and P. pellucidus, and another one formed by P. ovatus and P. rarus. We also provide comparative measurements of these four central European prosthogonimids, and address their tissue specificity, host-specific prevalence (based on the extensive bird cohort examined in years 1962-2014), and for some bird hosts we address also differences in the prevalence of Prosthogonimus spp. in natural and near-natural wetlands in comparison with fishponds utilized for intense carp production. We provide an updated key to European Prosthogonimus spp. based on their morphological characters.
355	25715691	Selection for Duration of Fertility and Mule Duck White Plumage Colour in a Synthetic Strain of Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Liu HC, Huang JF, Lee SR, Liu HL, Hsieh CH, Huang CW, Huang MC, Tai C, Poivey JP, Rouvier R, Cheng YS	Asian-Australas J Anim Sci	 2015 May;28(5):605-11	 doi: 105713/ajas140740	A synthetic strain of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) was developed by introducing genes for long duration of fertility to be used as mother of mule ducklings and a seven-generation selection experiment was conducted to increase the number of fertile eggs after a single artificial insemination (AI) with pooled Muscovy semen. Reciprocal crossbreeding between Brown Tsaiya LRI-2 (with long duration of fertility) and Pekin L-201 (with white plumage mule ducklings) ducks produced the G0. Then G1 were intercrossed to produce G2 and so on for the following generations. Each female duck was inseminated 3 times, at 26, 29, and 32 weeks of age. The eggs were collected for 14 days from day 2 after AI. Individual data regarding the number of incubated eggs (Ie), the number of fertile eggs at candling at day 7 of incubation (F), the total number of dead embryos (M), the maximum duration of fertility (Dm) and the number of hatched mule ducklings (H) with plumage colour were recorded. The selection criterion was the breeding values of the best linear unbiased prediction animal model for F. The results show high percentage of exhibited heterosis in G2 for traits to improve (19.1% for F and 12.9% for H); F with a value of 5.92 (vs 3.74 in the Pekin L-201) was improved in the G2. Heritabilities were found to be low for Ie (h (2) = 0.07+/-0.03) and M (h (2) = 0.07+/-0.01), moderately low for Dm (h (2) = 0.13+/-0.02), of medium values for H (h (2) = 0.20+/-0.03) and F (h (2) = 0.23+/-0.03). High and favourable genetic correlations existed between F and Dm (rg = 0.93), between F and H (rg = 0.97) and between Dm and H (rg = 0.90). The selection experiment showed a positive trend for phenotypic values of F (6.38 fertile eggs in G10 of synthetic strain vs 5.59 eggs in G4, and 3.74 eggs in Pekin L-201), with correlated response for increasing H (5.73 ducklings in G10 vs 4.86 in G4, and 3.09 ducklings in Pekin L-201) and maximum duration of the fertile period without increasing the embryo mortality rate. The average predicted genetic response for F was 40% of genetic standard deviation per generation of selection. The mule ducklings' feather colour also was improved. It was concluded that this study provided results for a better understanding of the genetics of the duration of fertility traits in the common female duck bred for mule and that the selection of a synthetic strain was effective method of improvement.
356	25706595	A novel green and template free approach for the synthesis of gold nanorice and its utilization as a catalyst for the degradation of hazardous dye.	Sinha T, Ahmaruzzaman M	Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc	 2015 May 5;142:266-70	 doi: 101016/jsaa201502020 Epub 2015 Feb 12	Herein, we describe a simple, green and template free method for the production of rice shaped gold nanostructures using an aqueous extract of the egg shells of Anas platyrhynchos. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) and FT-IR studies. The UV-visible spectrum of the synthesized gold nanostructures showed a transverse mode surface plasmon resonance peaks (SPR) at around 540nm and a longitudinal mode at 880nm. The TEM and SAED pattern confirmed the morphology, size and crystallographic structure of the synthesized gold nanorice. The synthesized gold nanorice was utilized for the removal of a toxic Eosin Y dye by photodegradation. It was observed that the dye was degraded completely within 1h and the percentage efficiency was found to be 96.1%.
357	25706091	Potency of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in hepatocyte cultures from chicken, Pekin duck, and greater scaup.	Head JA, Jeffery RW, Farmahin R, Kennedy SW	Environ Sci Technol	 2015 Mar 17;49(6):3787-94	 doi: 101021/acsest5b00125 Epub 2015 Mar 9	The potency of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was assessed in primary hepatocyte cultures prepared from chicken (Gallus domesticus), Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), and greater scaup (Aythya marila). TCDD and 8 of the PAHs induced EROD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Seven of these were previously shown to be acutely toxic to avian embryos, while the 10 congeners that did not produce an EROD response caused limited mortality. The rank order potency of the EROD-active congeners in all three species was as follows: TCDD>dibenz[ah]anthracene>benzo[k]fluoranthene>indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene>benzo[a]pyr ene>chrysene approximately benz[a]anthracene approximately benz[ghi]perylene>benzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]thiophene. Chicken hepatoctyes were more sensitive than duck hepatocytes to EROD induction by all test compounds, but the gap in species sensitivity was 100-fold for TCDD, and generally </=10-fold for PAHs. This study is the first to use in vitro methods to rank the AHR-mediated potency of PAHs in birds. These data may be useful for assessing risks associated with exposure to PAHs in the environment.
358	25691969	Minor differences in body condition and immune status between avian influenza virus-infected and noninfected mallards: a sign of coevolution-	van Dijk JG, Fouchier RA, Klaassen M, Matson KD	Ecol Evol	 2015 Jan;5(2):436-49	 doi: 101002/ece31359 Epub 2014 Dec 31	Wildlife pathogens can alter host fitness. Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection is thought to have negligible impacts on wild birds; however, effects of infection in free-living birds are largely unstudied. We investigated the extent to which LPAIV infection and shedding were associated with body condition and immune status in free-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), a partially migratory key LPAIV host species. We sampled mallards throughout the species' annual autumn LPAIV infection peak, and we classified individuals according to age, sex, and migratory strategy (based on stable hydrogen isotope analysis) when analyzing data on body mass and five indices of immune status. Body mass was similar for LPAIV-infected and noninfected birds. The degree of virus shedding from the cloaca and oropharynx was not associated with body mass. LPAIV infection and shedding were not associated with natural antibody (NAbs) and complement titers (first lines of defense against infections), concentrations of the acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp), ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes (H:L ratio), and avian influenza virus (AIV)-specific antibody concentrations. NAbs titers were higher in LPAIV-infected males and local (i.e., short distance) migrants than in infected females and distant (i.e., long distance) migrants. Hp concentrations were higher in LPAIV-infected juveniles and females compared to infected adults and males. NAbs, complement, and Hp levels were lower in LPAIV-infected mallards in early autumn. Our study demonstrates weak associations between infection with and shedding of LPAIV and the body condition and immune status of free-living mallards. These results may support the role of mallards as asymptomatic carriers of LPAIV and raise questions about possible coevolution between virus and host.
359	25669618	Occurrence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in wild birds in Galicia (Northwest Spain).	Reboredo-Fernandez A, Ares-Mazas E, Caccio SM, Gomez-Couso H	Parasitology	 2015 Jun;142(7):917-25	 doi: 101017/S0031182015000049 Epub 2015 Feb 11	Faecal samples were obtained from 433 wild birds being treated in wildlife recovery centres in Galicia (Northwest Spain), between February 2007 and September 2009. The birds belonged to 64 species representing 17 different orders. Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by an immunofluorescence antibody test and identified at the molecular level by established PCR-sequencing methods. The overall prevalence of Giardia was 2.1% and that of Cryptosporidium, 8.3%. To our knowledge, this is the first description of Giardia sp. in Tyto alba and Caprimulgus europaeus; and of Cryptosporidium sp. in Apus apus, Athene noctua, C. europaeus, Falco tinnunculus, Morus bassanus, Parabuteo unicinctus and Strix aluco. Furthermore, the first PCR-sequence confirmed detection of Giardia duodenalis assemblage B in, Buteo buteo, Coturnix coturnix and Pica pica; G. duodenalis assemblage D in Garrulus glandarius; and G. duodenalis assemblage F in Anas platyrhynchos; Cryptosporidium parvum in Accipiter nisus, B. buteo, Milvus migrans, Pernis apivorus and P. pica; and Cryptosporidium meleagridis in Streptopelia turtur. The study findings demonstrate the wide spread of Giardia and Cryptosporidium between wild birds.
360	25652220	Approaching birds with drones: first experiments and ethical guidelines.	Vas E, Lescroel A, Duriez O, Boguszewski G, Gremillet D	Biol Lett	 2015 Feb;11(2):20140754	 doi: 101098/rsbl20140754	Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly called drones, are being increasingly used in ecological research, in particular to approach sensitive wildlife in inaccessible areas. Impact studies leading to recommendations for best practices are urgently needed. We tested the impact of drone colour, speed and flight angle on the behavioural responses of mallards Anas platyrhynchos in a semi-captive situation, and of wild flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) and common greenshanks (Tringa nebularia) in a wetland area. We performed 204 approach flights with a quadricopter drone, and during 80% of those we could approach unaffected birds to within 4 m. Approach speed, drone colour and repeated flights had no measurable impact on bird behaviour, yet they reacted more to drones approaching vertically. We recommend launching drones farther than 100 m from the birds and adjusting approach distance according to species. Our study is a first step towards a sound use of drones for wildlife research. Further studies should assess the impacts of different drones on other taxa, and monitor physiological indicators of stress in animals exposed to drones according to group sizes and reproductive status.
361	25636141	Outbreaks of West Nile virus in captive waterfowl in Ontario, Canada.	Cox SL, Campbell GD, Nemeth NM	Avian Pathol	 2015;44(2):135-41	 doi: 101080/0307945720151011604	The detrimental effects of West Nile virus (WNV) have been well characterized in several taxonomic groups of North American birds, such as corvids and raptors. Relatively less is known about the virus' effects in waterfowl species, many of which are abundant in North America and occupy habitats, for example wetlands and marshes, likely to harbour dense mosquito populations. In two successive years, outbreaks of WNV-associated disease were observed in waterfowl at a rehabilitation centre. In the present report, clinical and pathological findings are provided for seven mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and one Canada goose (Branta canadensis) that developed acute disease and either died or were killed humanely. The most severe and consistent microscopic lesion in mallards was myocardial degeneration and coagulative necrosis consistent with acute heart failure. The Canada goose had necrotizing myocarditis. Other lesions included pulmonary perivascular oedema, lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis, and splenic and bursal lymphoid depletion. WNV infection was confirmed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Myofibres within all cardiac muscle layers had positive immunohistochemical staining, as did blood vessel walls in the heart and spleen. These results suggest that juvenile mallards are highly susceptible to fatal WNV-associated cardiac failure, and confirm that adult Canada geese are susceptible to fatal WNV-associated disease. The synchronous timing of clinical disease and death in these waterfowl are consistent with WNV mosquito-borne infections within a WNV transmission focus during the summer (July and August) of 2012 and 2013.
362	25616792	Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) virus strain with an H274Y mutation in neuraminidase persists without drug pressure in infected mallards.	Gillman A, Muradrasoli S, Soderstrom H, Holmberg F, Latorre-Margalef N, Tolf C, Waldenstrom J, Gunnarsson G, Olsen B, Jarhult JD	Appl Environ Microbiol	 2015 Apr;81(7):2378-83	 doi: 101128/AEM04034-14 Epub 2015 Jan 23	Influenza A virus (IAV) has its natural reservoir in wild waterfowl, and emerging human IAVs often contain gene segments from avian viruses. The active drug metabolite of oseltamivir (oseltamivir carboxylate [OC]), stockpiled as Tamiflu for influenza pandemic preparedness, is not removed by conventional sewage treatment and has been detected in river water. There, it may exert evolutionary pressure on avian IAV in waterfowl, resulting in the development of resistant viral variants. A resistant avian IAV can circulate among wild birds only if resistance does not restrict viral fitness and if the resistant virus can persist without continuous drug pressure. In this in vivo mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) study, we tested whether an OC-resistant avian IAV (H1N1) strain with an H274Y mutation in the neuraminidase (NA-H274Y) could retain resistance while drug pressure was gradually removed. Successively infected mallards were exposed to decreasing levels of OC, and fecal samples were analyzed for the neuraminidase sequence and phenotypic resistance. No reversion to wild-type virus was observed during the experiment, which included 17 days of viral transmission among 10 ducks exposed to OC concentrations below resistance induction levels. We conclude that resistance in avian IAV that is induced by exposure of the natural host to OC can persist in the absence of the drug. Thus, there is a risk that human-pathogenic IAVs that evolve from IAVs circulating among wild birds may contain resistance mutations. An oseltamivir-resistant pandemic IAV would pose a substantial public health threat. Therefore, our observations underscore the need for prudent oseltamivir use, upgraded sewage treatment, and surveillance for resistant IAVs in wild birds.
363	25590589	Incubation temperature influences trade-off between structural size and energy reserves in mallard hatchlings.	Kolackova M, Prokupkova L, Albrecht T, Horak D	Physiol Biochem Zool	 2015 Jan-Feb;88(1):1-10	 doi: 101086/679602 Epub 2014 Dec 23	The reproductive success of precocial birds depends on investments in clutch formation and incubation. Egg quality strongly affects the phenotypic traits correlated with survival of the hatchling, but parental ability to maintain incubation temperature can also influence hatchling outcomes. The effect of incubation temperature on hatchling phenotype has been widely studied in reptiles but not in birds. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of egg mass and incubation temperature on the incubation period, hatchability, and hatchling phenotype of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallard eggs were incubated under six constant incubation temperatures (ranging from 35.0 degrees to 39.0 degrees C). Hatchlings were weighed, and their structural size was measured. Some hatchlings were used for an examination of residual yolk sac mass and basic chemical composition of the yolk-free body. All investigated phenotypic traits except for chemical composition were positively correlated with egg mass. Incubation temperature did not affect hatchling body mass, but increased temperatures led to a decreased yolk-free body mass and structural size of hatchlings and to increased yolk sac mass. Our results suggest that there is a trade-off between the yolk-free body size and energetic reserves in the form of the yolk sac and that this trade-off is modulated by incubation temperature.
364	25588012	Surveillance and characterization of Riemerella anatipestifer from wild birds in South Korea.	Cha SY, Seo HS, Wei B, Kang M, Roh JH, Yoon RH, Kim JH, Jang HK	J Wildl Dis	 2015 Apr;51(2):341-7	 doi: 107589/2014-05-128 Epub 2015 Jan 14	We conducted surveillance for Riemerella anatipestifer (RA) in wild birds along the East Asian-Australasian flyway in South Korea. Detected RA were characterized by serotype, antibiotic susceptibility, and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. We collected 944 wild birds of 34 species from 19 of South Korea's major migratory wild bird habitats between 2011 and 2012. We identified RA by PCR and rRNA gene sequence in 71/102 (69.6%) pharyngeal swabs and 19/944 (2.0%) cloacal swabs of wild birds. Most RA positives (71/75 [95%] pharyngeal and 19/704 [(2.6%] cloacal) were from three duck species (family Anatidae): Mallard Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), and Spot-billed Duck (Anas poecilorhyncha). Thirty-three RA isolates obtained and examined were highly resistant to aminoglycosides: kanamycin (100%), gentamicin (94%), amikacin (91%), neomycin (88%), and streptomycin (82%). Six isolates were identified as serotype 4 by agar gel precipitation. Serotypes 1 and 7, which are known virulent serotypes, were also identified in three isolates from wild duck species.
365	25577952	Profiles of mRNA expression of related genes in the duck hypothalamus-pituitary growth axis during embryonic and early post-hatch development.	Hu Y, Liu H, Song C, Xu W, Ji G, Zhu C, Shu J, Li H	Gene	 2015 Mar 15;559(1):38-43	 doi: 101016/jgene201501009 Epub 2015 Jan 9	In this study, the ontogeny of body and liver weight and the pattern of related gene mRNA expression in the hypothalamus-pituitary growth axis (HPGA) of two different duck breeds (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) were compared during embryonic and post-hatch development. Duck hypothalamic growth hormone release hormone (GHRH), somatostatin (SS), pituitary growth hormone (GH), liver growth hormone receptor (GHR) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) mRNA were first detected on the 13th embryonic day. During early duck development, SS maintained a lower expression status, whereas the other four genes exhibited highly significant variations in an age-specific manner. Highly significant breed specificity was observed with respect to hepatic IGF-1 mRNA expression, which showed a significant breed-age interaction effect. Compared with previous studies on chickens, significant species differences were observed regarding the mRNA expression of bird embryonic HPGA-related genes. During early development, highly significant breed and age specificity were observed with respect to developmental changes in body and liver weight, and varying degrees of significant linear correlation were found between these performances and the mRNA expression of HPGA-related genes in the duck HPGA. These results suggest that different genetic backgrounds may lead to differences in duck growth and HPGA-related gene mRNA expression, and the differential mRNA expression of related genes in the duck HPGA may be particularly important in the early growth of ducks. Furthermore, hepatic IGF-1 mRNA expression presented highly significant breed specificity, and evidence suggests the involvement of hepatic IGF-1 in mediating genetic effects on embryo and offspring growth in ducks.
366	25518447	The first case of a major avian type C botulism outbreak in Poland.	Wlodarczyk R, Minias P, Kukier E, Grenda T, Smietanka K, Janiszewski T	Avian Dis	 2014 Sep;58(3):488-90	 doi: 101637/10669-091913-Case1	Major outbreaks of avian type C botulism have been rarely reported from Central Europe. In this paper, we report the first severe outbreak of avian type C botulism in Poland. In 2011-12, two epizootics caused by Clostridium botulinum took place at Jeziorsko dam reservoir and affected an estimated number of 5500 birds in 2011 and 1600 birds in 2012. In total, 24 species ofwaterbirds were affected, including mainly waterfowl (37.0%), shorebirds (27.0%), rallids (25.7%), and larids (9.1%). Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and coots (Fulica atra) were most commonly represented among all affected species (27.5% and 25.0% of all recorded carcasses, respectively). Laboratory analyses confirmed the presence of type C botulinum toxin in the internal organs of paralyzed birds. This case study from the Jeziorsko dam reservoir demonstrates that this type of shallow-water habitat is especially prone to avian botulism outbreaks in the climatic conditions of Central Europe.
367	25514789	Wild mallards have more "goose-like" bills than their ancestors: a case of anthropogenic influence-	Soderquist P, Norrstrom J, Elmberg J, Guillemain M, Gunnarsson G	PLoS One	 2014 Dec 16;9(12):e115143	 doi: 101371/journalpone0115143 eCollection 2014	Wild populations of the world's most common dabbling duck, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), run the risk of genetic introgression by farmed conspecifics released for hunting purposes. We tested whether bill morphology of free-living birds has changed since large-scale releases of farmed mallards started. Three groups of mallards from Sweden, Norway and Finland were compared: historical wild (before large-scale releases started), present-day wild, and present-day farmed. Higher density of bill lamellae was observed in historical wild mallards (only males). Farmed mallards had wider bills than present-day and historical wild ones. Present-day wild and farmed mallards also had higher and shorter bills than historical wild mallards. Present-day mallards thus tend to have more "goose-like" bills (wider, higher, and shorter) than their ancestors. Our study suggests that surviving released mallards affect morphological traits in wild population by introgression. We discuss how such anthropogenic impact may lead to a maladapted and genetically compromised wild mallard population. Our study system has bearing on other taxa where large-scale releases of conspecifics with 'alien genes' may cause a cryptic invasive process that nevertheless has fitness consequences for individual birds.
368	25481845	Cutaneous, respiratory and hepatic aspergillosis in Brazilian white Pekin mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Copetti MV, Barcelos Ada S, Kommers GD, Santurio JM, Oliveira FN, Lovato M	Mycopathologia	 2015 Apr;179(3-4):321-5	 doi: 101007/s11046-014-9833-6 Epub 2014 Dec 7	Aspergillosis is one of the most frequent mycosis affecting avian species. Here is reported an outbreak of aspergillosis affecting 60-day-old white Pekin mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). About 10% of animals in a lot of 200 mallards from a commercial husbandry presented respiratory disorders and skin lesions at slaughter. Three out of 13 animals sent to diagnosis showed, simultaneously, airsacculitis, lung and liver presenting white nodules with variable diameters and elevated, yellowish brown, crusted, multifocal skin lesions located at the base of the feather follicles in the breast. Histopathological examination of lung and liver samples revealed nodules of different sizes with small areas of necrosis surrounded by intense granulomatous inflammation and the presence of fungal hyphae. The skin samples showed dermatitis surrounding a severe necrotizing folliculitis, associated with fungal hyphae. Mycological evaluation of tissues allowed the isolation of Aspergillus fumigatus from the skin samples and Aspergillus flavus from lungs and liver samples. The application of quicklime (CaO) in the litter as part of the disinfection procedures could have contributed to the development of skin lesion in the mallards, predisposing the fungal installation in the damaged site. The occurrence of cutaneous lesions associated with A. fumigatus is a rare manifestation of aspergillosis in birds, and this appears to be the first case reported in white Pekin mallards.
369	25477681	A nuclear DNA-based species determination and DNA quantification assay for common poultry species.	Ng J, Satkoski J, Premasuthan A, Kanthaswamy S	J Food Sci Technol	 2014 Dec;51(12):4060-5	 doi: 101007/s13197-012-0893-7 Epub 2012 Nov 28	DNA testing for food authentication and quality control requires sensitive species-specific quantification of nuclear DNA from complex and unknown biological sources. We have developed a multiplex assay based on TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for species-specific detection and quantification of chicken (Gallus gallus), duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) nuclear DNA. The multiplex assay is able to accurately detect very low quantities of species-specific DNA from single or multispecies sample mixtures; its minimum effective quantification range is 5 to 50 pg of starting DNA material. In addition to its use in food fraudulence cases, we have validated the assay using simulated forensic sample conditions to demonstrate its utility in forensic investigations. Despite treatment with potent inhibitors such as hematin and humic acid, and degradation of template DNA by DNase, the assay was still able to robustly detect and quantify DNA from each of the three poultry species in mixed samples. The efficient species determination and accurate DNA quantification will help reduce fraudulent food labeling and facilitate downstream DNA analysis for genetic identification and traceability.
370	25450775	Plasmodium spp.: an experimental study on vertebrate host susceptibility to avian malaria.	Dimitrov D, Palinauskas V, Iezhova TA, Bernotiene R, Ilgunas M, Bukauskaite D, Zehtindjiev P, Ilieva M, Shapoval AP, Bolshakov CV, Markovets MY, Bensch S, Valkiunas G	Exp Parasitol	 2015 Jan;148:1-16	 doi: 101016/jexppara201411005 Epub 2014 Nov 18	The interest in experimental studies on avian malaria caused by Plasmodium species has increased recently due to the need of direct information about host-parasite interactions. Numerous important issues (host susceptibility, development of infection, the resistance and tolerance to avian malaria) can be answered using experimental infections. However, specificity of genetically different lineages of malaria parasites and their isolates is largely unknown. This study reviews recent experimental studies and offers additional data about susceptibility of birds to several widespread cytochrome b (cyt b) lineages of Plasmodium species belonging to four subgenera. We exposed two domesticated avian hosts (canaries Serinus canaria and ducklings Anas platyrhynchos) and also 16 species of common wild European birds to malaria infections by intramuscular injection of infected blood and then tested them by microscopic examination and PCR-based methods. Our study confirms former field and experimental observations about low specificity and wide host-range of Plasmodium relictum (lineages SGS1 and GRW11) and P. circumflexum (lineage TURDUS1) belonging to the subgenera Haemamoeba and Giovannolaia, respectively. However, the specificity of different lineages and isolates of the same parasite lineage differed between species of exposed hosts. Several tested Novyella lineages were species specific, with a few cases of successful development in experimentally exposed birds. The majority of reported cases of mortality and high parasitaemia were observed during parasite co-infections. Canaries were susceptible mainly for the species of Haemamoeba and Giovannolaia, but were refractory to the majority of Novyella isolates. Ducklings were susceptible to three malaria infections (SGS1, TURDUS1 and COLL4), but parasitaemia was light (<0.01%) and transient in all exposed birds. This study provides novel information about susceptibility of avian hosts to a wide array of malaria parasite lineages, outlining directions for future experimental research on various aspects of biology and epidemiology of avian malaria.
371	25391154	Migratory birds reinforce local circulation of avian influenza viruses.	Verhagen JH, van Dijk JG, Vuong O, Bestebroer T, Lexmond P, Klaassen M, Fouchier RA	PLoS One	 2014 Nov 12;9(11):e112366	 doi: 101371/journalpone0112366 eCollection 2014	Migratory and resident hosts have been hypothesized to fulfil distinct roles in infectious disease dynamics. However, the contribution of resident and migratory hosts to wildlife infectious disease epidemiology, including that of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in wild birds, has largely remained unstudied. During an autumn H3 LPAIV epizootic in free-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) - a partially migratory species - we identified resident and migratory host populations using stable hydrogen isotope analysis of flight feathers. We investigated the role of migratory and resident hosts separately in the introduction and maintenance of H3 LPAIV during the epizootic. To test this we analysed (i) H3 virus kinship, (ii) temporal patterns in H3 virus prevalence and shedding and (iii) H3-specific antibody prevalence in relation to host migratory strategy. We demonstrate that the H3 LPAIV strain causing the epizootic most likely originated from a single introduction, followed by local clonal expansion. The H3 LPAIV strain was genetically unrelated to H3 LPAIV detected both before and after the epizootic at the study site. During the LPAIV epizootic, migratory mallards were more often infected with H3 LPAIV than residents. Low titres of H3-specific antibodies were detected in only a few residents and migrants. Our results suggest that in this LPAIV epizootic, a single H3 virus was present in resident mallards prior to arrival of migratory mallards followed by a period of virus amplification, importantly associated with the influx of migratory mallards. Thus migrants are suggested to act as local amplifiers rather than the often suggested role as vectors importing novel strains from afar. Our study exemplifies that a multifaceted interdisciplinary approach offers promising opportunities to elucidate the role of migratory and resident hosts in infectious disease dynamics in wildlife.
372	25386907	Transfer of maternal antibodies against avian influenza virus in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	van Dijk JG, Mateman AC, Klaassen M	PLoS One	 2014 Nov 11;9(11):e112595	 doi: 101371/journalpone0112595 eCollection 2014	Maternal antibodies protect chicks from infection with pathogens early in life and may impact pathogen dynamics due to the alteration of the proportion of susceptible individuals in a population. We investigated the transfer of maternal antibodies against avian influenza virus (AIV) in a key AIV host species, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Combining observations in both the field and in mallards kept in captivity, we connected maternal AIV antibody concentrations in eggs to (i) female body condition, (ii) female AIV antibody concentration, (iii) egg laying order, (iv) egg size and (v) embryo sex. We applied maternity analysis to the eggs collected in the field to account for intraspecific nest parasitism, which is reportedly high in Anseriformes, detecting parasitic eggs in one out of eight clutches. AIV antibody prevalence in free-living and captive females was respectively 48% and 56%, with 43% and 24% of the eggs receiving these antibodies maternally. In both field and captive study, maternal AIV antibody concentrations in egg yolk correlated positively with circulating AIV antibody concentrations in females. In the captive study, yolk AIV antibody concentrations correlated positively with egg laying order. Female body mass and egg size from the field and captive study, and embryos sex from the field study were not associated with maternal AIV antibody concentrations in eggs. Our study indicates that maternal AIV antibody transfer may potentially play an important role in shaping AIV infection dynamics in mallards.
373	25208517	Concentration of trace elements in feathers of waterfowl, Korea.	Kim J, Oh JM	Environ Monit Assess	 2014 Dec;186(12):8517-25	 doi: 101007/s10661-014-4021-1 Epub 2014 Sep 11	Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) were analyzed in the breast feather of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons, n = 15), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos, n = 4), and spot-billed ducks (Anas poecilorhyncha, n = 13) found dead in Gimpo, Korea. All of the mallards and eight of the 13 spot-billed ducks had embedded shot. Concentrations of Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Fe were significantly different among waterfowl species. Mallards with embedded shot had relatively higher Pb, Cr, Mn, and Fe concentrations than the other species. Cd and Cr in feathers of waterfowl species were within the range reported for other birds, and no specimen exceeded the tentative threshold effect levels of Cd (2 mug/g dry weight (dw)) and Cr (2.8 mug/g dw) for birds. However, Pb in feathers of all four mallards and two spot-billed ducks exceeded the threshold for deleterious effects (>4 mug/g dw). Essential elements such as Cu, Mn, Zn, and Fe in the feather of waterfowl species were not at toxic levels and within the background or normal range for the homeostatic mechanisms.
374	25205059	Failure of productive infection of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with H16 subtype of avian influenza viruses.	Fereidouni SR, Harder TC, Globig A, Starick E	Influenza Other Respir Viruses	 2014 Nov;8(6):613-6	 doi: 101111/irv12275 Epub 2014 Sep 10	BACKGROUND: Mallard ducks and other waterfowl represent the most important reservoirs of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV). In addition, mallards are the most abundant duck species in Eurasia that migrate over long distances. Despite extended wild bird monitoring studies over the past decade in many Eurasian countries and investigating hundreds of thousands of wild bird samples, no mallard duck was found to be positive for avian influenza virus of subtype H16 in faecal, cloacal or oropharyngeal samples. Just three cases of H16 infections in Anseriformes species were described worldwide. In contrast, H16 viruses have been repeatedly isolated from birds of the Laridae family. OBJECTIVE: Here, we tested the hypothesis that mallards are less permissive to infection with H16 viruses. METHODS: Groups of mallard ducks of different age were inoculated via the oculo-nasal-oral route with different infectious doses of an H16N3 AIV. RESULTS: The ducks did not show any clinical symptoms, and no virus shedding was evident from cloacal and respiratory routes after experimental infection as shown by negative RT-qPCR results. In addition, all serum samples taken on days 8, 21 and 24 post-inoculation were negative by competitive NP-ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided evidence that mallards are resistant to infection with H16N3 LPAIV.
375	25179861	A novel minisequencing single-nucleotide polymorphism marker of the lysozyme gene detects high hatchability of Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Huang HL, Cheng YS	Theriogenology	 2014 Nov;82(8):1113-20	 doi: 101016/jtheriogenology201407031 Epub 2014 Aug 1	Lysozyme, one of the major albumen antimicrobials, can break down the polysaccharide walls of a broad spectrum of bacteria. This study presents a novel lysozyme marker of high hatchability in the form of minisequencing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, lysozyme was identified by complementary DNA microarray analysis as one of several differentially expressed genes noted to influence hatchability and recognized as a marker candidate for animal marker-assisted selection. Higher levels (P < 0.05) of lysozyme mRNA (via real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis) and protein (in Western blotting results) were found to be associated with a high-hatchability phenotype. In the preliminary sequence analysis of this study, TsLy1-1 and TsLy1-2 primer pairs, designed according to the lysozyme sequence, were used to amplify small-scale genomic DNA samples from animals in two extreme groups of hatchability. Sequence analysis of the amplified 763-bp DNA products clearly showed that AA and GG genotypes of SNP g.390A > G were from the ducks of the low- and high-hatchability groups, respectively. The SNP g.390A > G also created a new specificity protein 1 transcription factor binding site in the lysozyme gene. Primer pairs of TsLy2-1 and TsLy2-2 then probed the amplified 763-bp DNA products to produce a shorter fragment for easier minisequencing analysis to divide 114 ducks into GG, GA, and AA genotypes. The GG ducks had the highest hatchability, representing that a new lysozyme SNP marker of good hatchability performance can be used for the purpose of marker-assisted selection in Tsaiya ducks.
376	25137178	LM and TEM study of the orthokeratinized and parakeratinized epithelium of the tongue in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica).	Skieresz-Szewczyk K, Jackowiak H, Ratajczak M	Micron	 2014 Dec;67:117-124	 doi: 101016/jmicron201407004 Epub 2014 Jul 27	The previous histological studies of the lingual mucosa in birds characterized two types of keratinized epithelium, i.e. orthokeratinized and parakeratinized. These epithelia are composed of three layers: basal, intermediate and keratinized. The present study showed detailed ultrastructural features of cells in particular layers of two types of keratinized epithelia on the tongue in the domestic duck and defined structural differences. TEM observations showed a gradual reduction in cell organelles in the following layers, at increasing amounts of keratin fibers. The characteristic feature of the ortho- and parakeratinized epithelium is the presence of sub-layers in the intermediate layer, i.e. the upper and lower part, which results from the different shape of cell nuclei and dye affinity of the cytoplasm. The keratinized layer of ortho- and parakeratinized epithelium is built of two types of cells such as electron dark and light cells, which undergo exfoliation. The basic difference between the keratinized epithelia is the presence of flattened cell nuclei in the keratinized layer of the parakeratinized epithelium. The differentiating feature is also an arrangement of keratin fibers in the cell cytoplasm of the keratinized layer. The analysis of the thickness of the epithelium and the keratinized layer, indicated differences between keratinized epithelia, which result from two variants of performing protective functions, either through a thick keratinized layer or by a higher epithelium. Differences in the ultrastructure of the ortho- and parakeratinized epithelium are associated with mechanical functions of the epithelium resulting from different forces acting on the tongue during feeding activities.
377	25109712	Yolk size and ovulation order determine fertility within double-yolked duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) eggs.	Salamon A, Kent JP	Reprod Fertil Dev	 2016 Mar;28(4):440-5	 doi: 101071/RD14059	Herein we examined the effects of yolk size and ovulation order on the fertilisation of yolks within double-yolked (DY) duck eggs. Single-yolked (SY) duck eggs had high fertility (89.98%), whereas in DY duck eggs fertility was low (51.9% yolks). The yolks closer to the airspace (Yolk 1) in DY eggs had higher fertility (68.82% vs 34.98% for Yolk 2; P<0.001). When only one of the two yolks was fertilised, Yolk 1 was fertilised in 99.12% of those eggs. Yolk 1 is presumed to be the first ovulated. The higher fertility of Yolk 1 is consistent with a primacy effect where the first ovulation has a higher probability of achieving fertilisation. Small DY eggs within the normal SY egg weight range (75-104.9g) had significantly lower yolk fertility (47.91%; n=550) compared with large (>/=105g) DY eggs (54.56%; n=768; P<0.001). Yolk 1 fertility was lower in small compared with large DY eggs (64.18% vs 72.14%, respectively; P=0.003). Although Yolk 2 fertility was low, it was not affected by egg size. DY eggs with zero fertilised yolks were significantly lighter than DY eggs with one (P=0.007) or two (P<0.001) fertilised yolks (i.e. larger DY eggs were more likely to have fertilised yolks). Larger eggs (>/=105g) have larger yolks and the evidence here shows that an optimal yolk size is a significant positive factor in achieving fertilization by dislodging spermatozoa, after ovulation, from their storage sites.

Drouilhet L, Basso B, Bernadet MD, Cornuez A, Bodin L, David I, Gilbert H, Marie-Etancelin C	J Anim Sci	 2014 Oct;92(10):4287-96	 doi: 102527/jas2014-8064 Epub 2014 Aug 1	In France, about 95% of the fatty liver production comes from mule ducks, an infertile hybrid cross between female common ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and Muscovy drakes (Cairina moschata). As a hybrid, genetic improvement of the performance of mule ducks is achieved by selection of the parental populations. Feed represents two-thirds of the total costs of duck production; thus, the breeders' main concern is to improve the birds' feed efficiency without impairing their capacity to be overfed after the growing period. To obtain insight into this economically important trait, we designed a divergent selection experiment for Muscovy sires on the basis of the residual feed intake (RFI) of their male mule progeny. Residual feed intake represents the fraction of feed intake that cannot be explained by maintenance and production requirements. Data comprised records from generations 0 to 2 with 227 Muscovy sires of 2,016 mule ducks. Growth and fat deposition were measured individually for all mule ducks. Half-sib mule ducks were placed together in 1 small pen, and the feed consumption was recorded for each pen; all half-sibs therefore had the same feed intake estimates. Heritability of RFI was high (0.83 +/- 0.42), and after 2 generations of selection, the differences between lines in terms of RFI (contrast of 9.13 g/d, representing 0.76 phenotypic standard deviation; P < 0.0001) and feed conversion ratio (contrast of 0.08, representing 0.28 phenotypic standard deviation; P = 0.0003) were marked. In regard to carcass traits, the low-RFI line (high-efficiency animals) had heavier legs (476 vs. 463 g; P < 0.0001) and magret muscles (268 vs. 262 g; P = 0.001) than the high-RFI line (low-efficiency animals). No differences were observed for either the liver weight or the melting rate between the 2 lines (P > 0.46). Selection on RFI thus improves the feed efficiency of animals without impairing their capacity to produce fatty liver.
379	25083099	Selection and crossbreeding in relation to plumage color inheritance in three chinese egg type duck breeds (anas platyrhynchos).	Lin RL, Chen HP, Rouvier R, Poivey JP	Asian-Australas J Anim Sci	 2014 Aug;27(8):1069-74	 doi: 105713/ajas201313289	In China and South East Asia, the duck (common duck) is important in egg production for human consumption. Plumage color is a breed characteristic and of economic importance, together with egg production. Our aim in this study was to investigate the inheritance of plumage color in three Chinese indigenous egg-type duck breeds, Shan Ma (S), Putian White (F) and Putian black (P), and some of their crossbreds. These three breeds have different plumage color and are used in crossbreeding. The crossbred laying ducks Fx(PxS) and Fx(SxP) showed highly improved laying ability but heterogeneous plumage color. Genotypes at four relevant loci were investigated by studying down color and pattern in ducklings after crossbreeding. F1 ducklings from the matings FxS and SxF, PxS, and SxP were classified into four classes of plumage color (the Shan Ma plumage color, black, white, or multicolored) over three generations. Parents were selected for the Shan Ma plumage color of their progeny. In the fourth generation, P male and P female ducks were selected according to the frequency of the desired class of plumage color (Shan Ma) of their F1 progeny to obtain the so-called "Brown Putian Ma duck". The Shan Ma duck genotype was identified as having the restricted mallard color pattern (M(R)M(R)), full expression of any of the patterns or colors (CC), no extended black (ee) and no brown dilution D (D). The Putian White genotype was recessive white (cc), no extended black (ee) and no brown dilution D (D). The Putian Black genotype exhibited full expression of extended black (E gene) and no brown dilution (CCEE D [D]). It was shown that FxS and SxF tests should be implemented to eliminate the recessive white c allele in the S line and the dominant extended black E allele in the F line. It was also shown that the Brown Putian Ma obtained from Putian Black, with no extended black genotype (ee), could be used to get rid of the black plumage (E gene) in the crossbred ducks. This could provide a solution for producing 3-way crossbred ducks Putian Whitex(Putian-Ma xShan Ma) and Putian Whitex(Shan MaxPutian-Ma), with the desired Shan Ma feather color.
380	25009556	A consensus approach to vertebrate de novo transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq data: assembly of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) transcriptome.	Moreton J, Dunham SP, Emes RD	Front Genet	 2014 Jun 25;5:190	 doi: 103389/fgene201400190 eCollection 2014	For vertebrate organisms where a reference genome is not available, de novo transcriptome assembly enables a cost effective insight into the identification of tissue specific or differentially expressed genes and variation of the coding part of the genome. However, since there are a number of different tools and parameters that can be used to reconstruct transcripts, it is difficult to determine an optimal method. Here we suggest a pipeline based on (1) assessing the performance of three different assembly tools (2) using both single and multiple k-mer (MK) approaches (3) examining the influence of the number of reads used in the assembly (4) merging assemblies from different tools. We use an example dataset from the vertebrate Anas platyrhynchos domestica (Pekin duck). We find that taking a subset of data enables a robust assembly to be produced by multiple methods without the need for very high memory capacity. The use of reads mapped back to transcripts (RMBT) and CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) provides useful metrics to determine the completeness of assembly obtained. For this dataset the use of MK in the assembly generated a more complete assembly as measured by greater number of RMBT and CEGMA score. Merged single k-mer assemblies are generally smaller but consist of longer transcripts, suggesting an assembly consisting of fewer fragmented transcripts. We suggest that the use of a subset of reads during assembly allows the relatively rapid investigation of assembly characteristics and can guide the user to the most appropriate transcriptome for particular downstream use. Transcriptomes generated by the compared assembly methods and the final merged assembly are freely available for download at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1032613.
381	25003652	Health of domestic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) following exposure to oil sands process-affected water.	Beck EM, Smits JE, St Clair CC	Environ Sci Technol	 2014;48(15):8847-54	 doi: 101021/es501259x Epub 2014 Jul 17	Bitumen extraction from the oil sands of northern Alberta produces large volumes of process-affected water that contains substances toxic to wildlife. Recent monitoring has shown that tens of thousands of birds land on ponds containing this water annually, creating an urgent need to understand its effects on bird health. We emulated the repeated, short-term exposures that migrating water birds are thought to experience by exposing pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) to recycled oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). As indicators of health, we measured a series of physiological (electrolytes, metabolites, enzymes, hormones, and blood cells) and toxicological (metals and minerals) variables. Relative to controls, juvenile birds exposed to OSPW had higher potassium following the final exposure, and males had a higher thyroid hormone ratio (T3/T4). In adults, exposed birds had higher vanadium, and, following the final exposure, higher bicarbonate. Exposed females had higher bile acid, globulin, and molybdenum levels, and males, higher corticosterone. However, with the exception of the metals, none of these measures varied from available reference ranges for ducks, suggesting OSPW is not toxic to juvenile or adult birds after three and six weekly, 1 h exposures, but more studies are needed to know the generality of this result.
382	25002547	The influence of choice feeding and cereal type (corn or triticale) during the finishing period on performance of mule ducks.	Arroyo J, Fortun-Lamothe L, Dubois JP, Lavigne F, Bijja M, Molette C	Poult Sci	 2014 Sep;93(9):2220-6	 doi: 103382/ps2013-03669 Epub 2014 Jul 7	The aim of this trial was to study the influence of choice feeding and cereal type (corn or triticale) during the finishing period on performance of ducks. In total, 624 one-day-old male mule ducks (Cairina moschata x Anas platyrhynchos) were divided into 3 groups differing in the diet they received between 56 and 84 d of age: a commercial complete pelleted diet (control group; AMEn 12.1 MJ/kg, CP 15%), or corn whole seeds (AMEn 14.4 MJ/kg, CP 7.3%) and protein-rich pellets (AMEn 9.9 MJ/kg, CP 22.7%) in 2 separated feeders [choice feeding with corn (CFC) group]; or triticale whole seeds (AMEn 13.0 MJ/kg, CP 10.5%) and protein-rich pellets (AMEn 11.2 MJ/kg, CP 19.5%) in 2 separated feeders [choice feeding with triticale (CFT) group]. From 85 to 96 d, 96 birds/group were overfed with corn. Feed intake (complete pellets or cereal and protein-rich pellets) per pen was measured at 60, 62, 65, 69, 78, and 84 d of age. Body weight and body traits were measured at 56 to 84 d of age. Over the entire period, from 56 to 84 d, the feed intake of the CFC group was 7% lower than the control group, and 5% lower than that in the CFT group (P = 0.002). Whatever the diet tested, at 56 and 84 d of age, the BW (4,099 and 4,779 g, P = 0.42 and P = 0.35, respectively) and the carcass traits (P > 0.05) of ducks were similar in the 3 groups. During and after overfeeding, the performances of the ducks were also similar (P > 0.05). The present results suggest that CFC during the finishing period is a solution to reduce the cost of diet destined to ducks. Indeed, using locally grown grains could reduce the economic and environmental impacts of duck feeding, reducing the transportation and crushing processes.
383	24992969	Quack leptin.	Friedman-Einat M, Seroussi E	BMC Genomics	 2014 Jul 3;15:551	 doi: 101186/1471-2164-15-551	BACKGROUND: A LEP transcript up-regulated in lungs of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected by avian influenza A virus was recently described in the Nature Genetics manuscript that reported the duck genome. In vertebrates, LEP gene symbol is reserved for leptin, the key regulator of energy balance in mammals. RESULTS: Launching an extensive search for this gene in the genome data that was submitted to the public databases along with duck genome manuscript and extending this search to all avian genomes in the whole-genome shotgun-sequencing database, we were able to report the first identification of coding sequences capable of encoding the full leptin protein precursor in wild birds. Gene structure, synteny and sequence-similarity (up to 54% identity and 68% similarity) to reptilian leptin evident in falcons (Falco peregrinus and cherrug), tits (Pseudopodoces humilis), finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and doves (Columba livia) confirmed that the bird leptin was a true ortholog of its mammalian form. Nevertheless, in duck, like other domestic fowls the LEP gene was not identifiable. CONCLUSION: Lack of the LEP gene in poultry suggests that birds that have lost it are particularly suited to domestication. Identification of an intact avian gene for leptin in wild birds might explain in part the evolutionary conservation of its receptor in leptin-less fowls.

Zhang Y, Xie Z, Xie L, Tan W, Liu J, Deng X, Xie Z, Luo S	Mitochondrial DNA A DNA Mapp Seq Anal	 2016;27(2):1146-7	 doi: 103109/194017362014936411 Epub 2014 Jul 3	The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Longsheng duck was measured by PCR-based methods. Our research findings revealed that the entire mitochondrial genome of the Longsheng duck was 16,603 bp (GenBank accession number: KJ739616). The contents of A, T, C, and G in the mitochondrial genome were 29.22%, 22.21%, 32.79% and 15.77%, respectively, which were similar to the majority of most avian species. The complete mitochondrial genome of the Longsheng duck contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and one control region. Components of the Longsheng duck's mitochondrial genome were similar to those of other Anas platyrhynchos in gene arrangement and composition. The complete mitochondrial genome of the Longsheng duck should provide essential information for understanding phylogenetic relationships of duck mitochondrial genome.
385	24981929	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of ferritin, heavy polypeptide 1 gene from duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Xu Q, Chen Y, Zhang Y, Tong YY, Huang ZY, Zhao WM, Duan XJ, Li X, Chang GB, Chen GH	Mol Biol Rep	 2014 Sep;41(9):6233-40	 doi: 101007/s11033-014-3503-0 Epub 2014 Jul 1	H-ferritin is a core subunit of the iron storage protein ferritin, and is related to the pathogenesis of malignant diseases. A differential expressed sequence tag of the ferritin, heavy polypeptide 1 gene (FTH1) was obtained from our previously constructed suppression subtractive cDNA library from 3-day-old ducklings challenged with duck hepatitis virus type I (DHV-1). The expression and function of FTH1 in immune defense against infection remains largely unknown in ducks. In this study, the full-length duFTH1 cDNA was obtained using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. It consisted of 153 basepairs (bp) 5'untranslated region (UTR), 183 bp 3'UTR, and 546 bp open reading frame that encodes a single protein of 181 amino acid residues. duFTH1 shares high similarity with FTH1 genes from other vertebrates. The amino acid sequence possesses the conserved domain of typical ferritin H subunits, including seven metal ligands in the ferroxidase center, one iron binding region signature, and a potential bio-mineralization residue (Thy(29)). Moreover, in agreement with a previously reported ferritin H subunit, we identified an iron response element in the 5'UTR. RT-PCR analyses revealed duFTH1 mRNA is widely expressed in various tissues. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses suggested that duFTH1 mRNA is significantly up-regulated in the liver after DHV-1 injection or polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C) treatment, reaching a peak 4 h post-infection, and dropping progressively and returning to normal after 24 h. Our findings suggest that duFTH1 functions as an iron chelating protein subunit in duck and contributes to the innate immune responses against viral infections.
386	24971887	Movements, home-range size and habitat selection of mallards during autumn migration.	Bengtsson D, Avril A, Gunnarsson G, Elmberg J, Soderquist P, Norevik G, Tolf C, Safi K, Fiedler W, Wikelski M, Olsen B, Waldenstrom J	PLoS One	 2014 Jun 27;9(6):e100764	 doi: 101371/journalpone0100764 eCollection 2014	The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is a focal species in game management, epidemiology and ornithology, but comparably little research has focused on the ecology of the migration seasons. We studied habitat use, time-budgets, home-range sizes, habitat selection, and movements based on spatial data collected with GPS devices attached to wild mallards trapped at an autumn stopover site in the Northwest European flyway. Sixteen individuals (13 males, 3 females) were followed for 15-38 days in October to December 2010. Forty-nine percent (SD = 8.4%) of the ducks' total time, and 85% of the day-time (SD = 28.3%), was spent at sheltered reefs and bays on the coast. Two ducks used ponds, rather than coast, as day-roosts instead. Mallards spent most of the night (76% of total time, SD = 15.8%) on wetlands, mainly on alvar steppe, or in various flooded areas (e.g. coastal meadows). Crop fields with maize were also selectively utilized. Movements between roosting and foraging areas mainly took place at dawn and dusk, and the home-ranges observed in our study are among the largest ever documented for mallards (mean = 6,859 ha; SD = 5,872 ha). This study provides insights into relatively unknown aspects of mallard ecology. The fact that autumn-staging migratory mallards have a well-developed diel activity pattern tightly linked to the use of specific habitats has implications for wetland management, hunting and conservation, as well as for the epidemiology of diseases shared between wildlife and domestic animals.
387	24933161	Genomic characterization of a novel picornavirus in Pekin ducks.	Liao Q, Zheng L, Yuan Y, Shi J, Zhang D	Vet Microbiol	 2014 Aug 6;172(1-2):78-91	 doi: 101016/jvetmic201405002 Epub 2014 May 13	A novel picornavirus was detected from Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) and completely sequenced. The virus was most closely related to megriviruses, with amino acid identities of 32-68%, 35-45%, 51-57%, 41-50%, and 61-63% in the P1, P2, P3, polyprotein, and 2C and 3CD regions, respectively. The virus was thus identified as an additional species in the genus Megrivirus and named Duck megrivirus (DMV). Sequence analyses indicated that the DMV genome possessed a megrivirus-like organization and also exhibited several unique features. The polyadenylated genome comprised 9700nt, one of the largest among known picornaviruses. A notable feature was the 2A region, which had an association of two distinct, function-unknown 2As (2A1 and 2A2) and a parechovirus-like 2A3. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) contained a variant type IVB internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which possessed a long helix III4 ending with the "8"-like 20-nt-long conserved structure at the top of domain III. The secondary structure model of inferred domain III of DMV-like IRES was also conserved in quail picornavirus, pigeon picornavirus B, and megriviruses. Domain II in DMV contained the conserved internal and apical loops previously identified in groups A and C of hepacivirus/pestivirus like IRESs. Moreover, DMV was closely related to different megriviruses in different genomic regions. These findings suggest that recombination events involving exchange of coding and noncoding regions may have occurred. DMV was detected in 28 of 117 (23.9%) ducks from four provinces in China, suggesting a high prevalence of DMV in duck populations.
388	24926893	Reference genes for quantitative gene expression studies in multiple avian species.	Olias P, Adam I, Meyer A, Scharff C, Gruber AD	PLoS One	 2014 Jun 13;9(6):e99678	 doi: 101371/journalpone0099678 eCollection 2014	Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) rapidly and reliably quantifies gene expression levels across different experimental conditions. Selection of suitable reference genes is essential for meaningful normalization and thus correct interpretation of data. In recent years, an increasing number of avian species other than the chicken has been investigated molecularly, highlighting the need for an experimentally validated pan-avian primer set for reference genes. Here we report testing a set for 14 candidate reference genes (18S, ABL, GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, HPRT, PGK1, RPL13, RPL19, RPS7, SDHA, TFRC, VIM, YWHAZ) on different tissues of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), common crane (Grus grus), white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo f. domestica), cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), Humboldt penguin (Sphenicus humboldti), ostrich (Struthio camelus) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), spanning a broad range of the phylogenetic tree of birds. Primer pairs for six to 11 genes were successfully established for each of the nine species. As a proof of principle, we analyzed expression levels of 10 candidate reference genes as well as FOXP2 and the immediate early genes, EGR1 and CFOS, known to be rapidly induced by singing in the avian basal ganglia. We extracted RNA from microbiopsies of the striatal song nucleus Area X of adult male zebra finches after they had sang or remained silent. Using three different statistical algorithms, we identified five genes (18S, PGK1, RPS7, TFRC, YWHAZ) that were stably expressed within each group and also between the singing and silent conditions, establishing them as suitable reference genes. In conclusion, the newly developed pan-avian primer set allows accurate normalization and quantification of gene expression levels in multiple avian species.
389	24913959	Mapping quantitative trait loci affecting some carcass and meat traits in duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Mucha S, Grajewski B, Gornowicz E, Lisowski M, Radziszewska J, Szwaczkowski T	J Appl Genet	 2014 Nov;55(4):497-503	 doi: 101007/s13353-014-0224-y Epub 2014 Jun 10	Contrary to chicken and livestock mammals, duck genome has not been explored much. Nowadays a relatively small number of reports on molecular variability and mapping of loci in Peking ducks has been published. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect single loci affecting body weight, carcass and meat traits in Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The study was based on an F2 cross between two parental lines A-55 and GL-30. Phenotypes of 387 birds from generation F2 including carcass and meat quality traits were collected. Linkage map, of the linkage group CAU1, consisting of 29 microsatellite markers was constructed. One highly significant (p < 0.01) QTL for skin weight was identified at the beginning (0 cM) of the linkage group CAU1. Two significant QTL (p < 0.05) were found for fatness of leg muscle and leg muscle electrical conductivity - 24 hours post slaughtering (EC24h) at 178 and 100 cM, respectively. Additionally one suggestive QTL for odour of leg muscle was identified at 265 cM.
390	24909127	Morphogenesis of the tongue mucosa in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica) during the late embryonic stages.	Skieresz-Szewczyk K, Jackowiak H, Kontecka H	Microsc Res Tech	 2014 Sep;77(9):667-74	 doi: 101002/jemt22387 Epub 2014 Jun 7	The tongue in domestic duck, as in other Anseriformes, is characterized by wide variety of shape and mechanical papillae and they fulfill different function during food collection. The present work aims to describe morphological features of the tongue as well as the pace formation of the mechanical papillae during embryonic period. The results may allow to answer whether the tongue in duck is ready to fulfill feeding function after hatching. The study revealed that the particular part of the tongue and the conical papillae of the body develop between 10th and 16th day of incubation, from the caudal part of the body into the rostral part of the tongue. The conical papillae of the lingual prominence in the first row are formed from 11th to 16th day and in the second row at the turn of the 15th and 16th day of incubation. These papillae developed symmetrically from the median part of the lingual prominence, to its edges. The lingual comb, which is used during transport of the food particles, is formed between 16th and 19th day. The present study indicated the morphological changes of the particular part of the tongue and the mechanical papillae were varied between the developmental stages. The morphology of the tongue in the domestic duck is fully developed before hatching and ready to collect food by pecking and grazing. However, filter-feeding mechanism is not still obvious.
391	24899432	Characterization of cytokine expression induced by avian influenza virus infection with real-time RT-PCR.	Kapczynski DR, Jiang HJ, Kogut MH	Methods Mol Biol	 2014;1161:217-33	 doi: 101007/978-1-4939-0758-8_18	Knowledge of how birds react to infection from avian influenza virus is critical to understanding disease pathogenesis and host response. The use of real-time (R) RT-PCR to measure innate immunity, including cytokine and interferon gene expression, has become a standard technique employed by avian immunologists interested in examining these responses. This technique utilizes nucleotide primers and fluorescent reporter molecules to measure amplification of the gene of interest. The use of RRT-PCR negates the need for northern blot analysis or DNA sequencing. It is simple, specific and sensitive for the gene of interest. However, it is dependent on knowing the target sequence prior to testing so that the optimal primers can be designed. The recent publication of genomic sequences of Gallus gallus, Meleagris gallopavo, and Anas platyrhynchos species makes it possible to measure cytokine expression in chicken, turkey, and duck species, respectively. Although these tests do not measure functionally expressed protein, the lack of antibodies to identify and quantify avian cytokines from different avian species makes this technique critical to any characterization of innate immune responses through cytokine and interferon activation or repression.
392	24885647	Infected or not: are PCR-positive oropharyngeal swabs indicative of low pathogenic influenza A virus infection in the respiratory tract of Mallard Anas platyrhynchos-	Wille M, van Run P, Waldenstrom J, Kuiken T	Vet Res	 2014 May 14;45:53	 doi: 101186/1297-9716-45-53	Detection of influenza virus in oropharyngeal swabs collected during wild bird surveillance is assumed to represent respiratory infection, although intestine is the main site of infection. We tested this assumption by histological examination of the respiratory tract of wild Mallards with virus-positive oropharyngeal swabs. Thirty-two of 125 Mallards tested had viral-RNA positive oropharyngeal swabs. The respiratory tracts of four Mallards with the most virus were examined in detail by immunohistochemistry. None had detectable virus antigen in the respiratory tract, suggesting it was not infected. An alternative explanation is that the oropharynx was contaminated with virus through feeding in surface water or through preening.
393	24879704	Metabolomic study of fatty livers in ducks: Identification by 1H-NMR of metabolic markers associated with technological quality.	Bonnefont CM, Guerra A, Theron L, Molette C, Canlet C, Fernandez X	Poult Sci	 2014 Jun;93(6):1542-52	 doi: 103382/ps2013-03546	The control of fatty liver fat loss during cooking is a major issue. Previous studies showed that fat loss was influenced by bird production factors and liver technological treatments. However, part of the variability in fat loss remained uncontrolled. To provide enhanced insights into the determinism of fatty liver quality, liver hydrophilic metabolite profiles were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance of the proton ((1)H-NMR). The study aimed at i) comparing fatty livers with extreme fat loss values and ii) at characterizing the effect of postmortem evolution of livers during chilling. A group of 240 male mule ducks (Cairina moschata x Anas platyrhynchos) was reared and overfed. Their livers were sampled at 20 min and 6 h postmortem. Of these birds, 2 groups of ducks were built with extreme values on the technological yield (TY; TY = 100 - % fat loss; the low-fat-loss group, TY = 89.9%, n = 13; and the high-fat-loss group, TY = 68.3%, n = 12, P < 0.001). The (1)H-NMR analyses showed that the high-fat-loss livers were more advanced in postmortem biochemical and structural changes than low-fat-loss livers early postmortem. The high-fat-loss livers were characterized by hydrolysis of glycogen into glucose, worse integrity of cell membrane with diminution of compounds of phospholipids, and higher catabolic processes. The accelerated postmortem processes may be the origin of the differences in fat loss during cooking. During the early postmortem period, the adenosine triphosphate amount in liver cells was strongly reduced and lipolysis of triglycerides seemed to be enhanced. The glycogen stored in liver was first converted into glucose, but contrary to what happens in postmortem muscles, glucose was not converted into lactate.

With the base composition of 29.20% for A, 22.19% for T, 32.82% for C, 15.79% for G, so the percentage of A and T (51.39%) was slightly higher than those of G and C. The Jingxi duck mitochondrial genome contained two ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and one non-coding control region (D-loop region). The arrangement of these genes was the same as most birds. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Jingxi duck will be useful for phylogenetics, and provide an important data set for further study on the germplasm resources.
395	24854704	Assessment of lead exposure in waterfowl species, Korea.	Kim J, Oh JM	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2014 Nov;67(4):529-34	 doi: 101007/s00244-014-0039-1 Epub 2014 May 23	Lead concentrations were analyzed in white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons, n = 15), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos, n = 4), and spot-billed ducks (A. poecilorhyncha, n = 13) found dead near Gimpo, Korea, to determine tissue- and species-specific lead concentration differences and to assess the effect of embedded lead shot. In livers, kidneys, and bones (tarsus), mallards and spot-billed ducks with embedded shot had greater lead concentrations than white-fronted geese and spot-billed ducks without lead shot. Lead concentrations in spot-billed ducks were greater in bones than in livers and kidneys suggesting chronic exposure to lead. Lead concentrations in 8 of 32 livers, 5 of 32 kidneys, and 9 of 32 bones exceeded the threshold level of abnormal exposure for wild birds (>5 microg/g dw in lives, >6 microg/g dw in kidney, and >6.75 microg/g dw in bone). Increased lead concentrations in soft tissues and bones might be attributed to increased lead shot ingestion and embedded shot. Lead concentrations were correlated between livers and kidneys, between livers and bones, and between kidneys and bones. These results suggest that a relationship between acute exposure in livers and kidneys and chronic exposure in bones.

Wang C, Zheng AJ, Xie M, Huang W, Xie JJ, Hou SS	Animal	 2014 Jul;8(7):1113-8	 doi: 101017/S1751731114001086 Epub 2014 May 7	An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of arginine on feed intake regulation. One hundred and twenty six 1-day-old male White Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) were randomly were allotted to one of two dietary treatments. The birds were fed diets containing 0.71% (deficient) or 1.27% (sufficient) arginine for 3 weeks. At 21 days of age, feed intake was determined and hypothalamic protein profiles were analyzed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification technique. The birds fed with arginine-deficient diet had a lower final live BW and cumulative feed intake (P1.5-fold expressional changes between arginine-deficient and -sufficient dietary treatments. Nine of these proteins were upregulated and seven of them were downregulated. The identified proteins could be regrouped into six categories: protein processing, carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, transporter, cytoskeleton, immunity and neuronal development. Dietary arginine deficiency decreased expression of proteins involved in energy production (glycine amidinotransferase, aldolase B fructose-bisphosphate, aconitase, transaldolase, 6-phosphofructokinase type C-like) and oxygen transportation (haemoglobin subunit alpha expression). The proteomic alterations described here provides valuable insights into the interactions of arginine with appetite.
397	24802728	Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos)-mediated dispersal of Lemnaceae: a contributing factor in the spread of invasive Lemna minuta-	Coughlan NE, Kelly TC, Jansen MA	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	 2015 Jan;17 Suppl 1:108-14	 doi: 101111/plb12182 Epub 2014 May 6	Our ability to predict and manage the spread of alien, invasive plants is limited by a lack of understanding of dispersal potential. Invasive Lemna minuta has spread within a few decennia throughout Europe. However, the mechanism by which the species continues to spread remains a matter of speculation. In this study, hypothesised epizoochorous transport of L. minuta propagules by mallard ducks was investigated. Landolt (Biosystematic investigations in the family of duckweeds (Lemnaceae) (Vol. 2), The family of Lemnaceae - a monographic study (Vol. 1), 1986, Veroffentlichungen des Geobotanischen Institutes Der Eidg. Techniasche Hochschule, Stiftung Rubel, Zurich, Switzerland) referred to desiccation as the key limitation of the "colonization capability" of Lemnaceae. Therefore, we analysed retention of viability in L. minuta kept outside the liquid growth medium. Our data show prolonged viability of L. minuta fronds inserted between the feathers of a mallard duck. Consistently, the relative humidity between feathers ranged between 65% and 90%. Taking together evidence of entanglement and retention of L. minuta between the feathers of live ducks, with retention of viability, we consider it likely that mallards contribute to L. minuta dispersal. These data have implications for the management strategy of this invasive species.
398	24795823	Avian influenza surveillance in the danube delta using sentinel geese and ducks.	Coman A, Maftei DN, Chereches RM, Zavrotchi E, Bria P, Dragnea C, McKenzie PP, Valentine MA, Gray GC	Influenza Res Treat	 2014;2014:965749	 doi: 101155/2014/965749 Epub 2014 Mar 25	Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus incursions from migrating birds have occurred multiple times in Romania since 2005. Beginning in September 2008 through April 2013, seasonal sentinel surveillance for avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) using domestic geese (Anser cygnoides) and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in the Danube Delta was established by placing 15 geese and 5 ducks at seven sites. Tracheal and cloacal swabs, and sera collections (starting in 2009) were taken monthly. We studied a total of 580 domestic birds and collected 5,520 cloacal and tracheal swabs from each and 2,760 sera samples. All swabs were studied with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for evidence of AIV. Serological samples were studied with hemagglutination inhibition assays against avian H5, H7, and H9 influenza viruses. From 2009 to 2013, 47 swab specimens from Cot Candura, Enisala, and Saon screened positive for AIV; further subtyping demonstrated that 14 ducks and 20 geese had cloacal evidence of H5N3 carriage. Correspondingly, 4 to 12 weeks after these molecular detections, sentinel bird sera revealed elevated HI titers against H5 virus antigens. We posit that domestic bird surveillance is an effective method to conduct AIV surveillance among migrating birds in delta areas.
399	24795314	Development of skeletal muscle and expression of myogenic regulatory factors during embryonic development in Jinding ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Zhu C, Gi G, Tao Z, Song C, Zhu W, Song W, Li H	Poult Sci	 2014 May;93(5):1211-6	 doi: 103382/ps2013-03695	The important roles of myogenic regulatory factors (MRF) in mammalian skeletal myogenesis have been well studied, but few equivalent studies have been performed in poultry. The expression pattern of MRF during the embryonic development of skeletal muscle in ducks remains unknown. In this study, we identified Myf5, Myf6, MyoD, and myogenin genes in Jinding ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) and quantified their expression levels in breast muscle (BM) and leg muscle (LM) at embryonic d 13, 17, 21, 25, and 27 by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Body weight and muscle weight show different developmental patterns. The MRF genes were expressed in both BM and LM, but with different expression patterns. The MyoD gene showed lower expression levels in BM before embryonic d 21 compared with LM, whereas the opposite pattern was found later. The higher expression level of MyoD, as well its lagged expression pattern in BM, suggest that the MyoD gene may be involved in maintaining the development of different muscles. Correlation analysis showed that myogenin gene expression levels were significantly negatively correlated with BW and muscle weight in both BM and LM (P < 0.001), and MyoD and Myf6 gene expression levels were more strongly correlated with muscle weight in LM than in BM. The results of this study provide novel evidence for MRF expression in ducks in embryonic stage- and skeletal muscle-dependent manners, and provide a foundation for understanding the molecular control of skeletal muscle growth in duck breeds.
400	24788792	Genomic characterization of H14 subtype Influenza A viruses in new world waterfowl and experimental infectivity in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Ramey AM, Poulson RL, Gonzalez-Reiche AS, Perez DR, Stallknecht DE, Brown JD	PLoS One	 2014 May 1;9(5):e95620	 doi: 101371/journalpone0095620 eCollection 2014	Recent repeated isolation of H14 hemagglutinin subtype influenza A viruses (IAVs) in the New World waterfowl provides evidence to suggest that host and/or geographic ranges for viruses of this subtype may be expanding. In this study, we used genomic analyses to gain inference on the origin and evolution of H14 viruses in New World waterfowl and conducted an experimental challenge study in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to evaluate pathogenicity, viral replication, and transmissibility of a representative viral strain in a natural host species. Genomic characterization of H14 subtype IAVs isolated from New World waterfowl, including three isolates sequenced specifically for this study, revealed high nucleotide identity among individual gene segments (e.g. >/=95% shared identity among H14 HA gene segments). In contrast, lower shared identity was observed among internal gene segments. Furthermore, multiple neuraminidase subtypes were observed for H14 IAVs isolated in the New World. Gene segments of H14 viruses isolated after 2010 shared ancestral genetic lineages with IAVs isolated from wild birds throughout North America. Thus, genomic characterization provided evidence for viral evolution in New World waterfowl through genetic drift and genetic shift since purported introduction from Eurasia. In the challenge study, no clinical disease or lesions were observed among mallards experimentally inoculated with A/blue-winged teal/Texas/AI13-1028/2013(H14N5) or exposed via contact with infected birds. Titers of viral shedding for mallards challenged with the H14N5 IAV were highest at two days post-inoculation (DPI); however shedding was detected up to nine DPI using cloacal swabs. The distribution of viral antigen among mallards infected with H14N5 IAV was largely restricted to enterocytes lining the villi in the lower intestinal tract and in the epithelium of the bursa of Fabricius. Characterization of the infectivity of A/blue-winged teal/Texas/AI13-1028/2013(H14N5) in mallards provides support for similarities in viral replication and shedding as compared to previously described waterfowl-adapted, low pathogenic IAV strains in ducks.
401	24779463	Avian bornavirus in free-ranging waterfowl: prevalence of antibodies and cloacal shedding of viral RNA.	Delnatte P, Nagy E, Ojkic D, Leishman D, Crawshaw G, Elias K, Smith DA	J Wildl Dis	 2014 Jul;50(3):512-23	 doi: 107589/2013-08-218 Epub 2014 Apr 29	We surveyed free-ranging Canada Geese (Branta canadensis), Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator), Mute Swans (Cygnus olor), and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to estimate the prevalence of antibodies to avian bornavirus (ABV) and of cloacal shedding of ABV RNA in southern Ontario, Canada. Blood samples and cloacal swabs were collected from 206 free-ranging Canada Geese, 135 Trumpeter Swans, 75 Mute Swans, and 208 Mallards at 10 main capture sites between October 2010 and May 2012. Sera were assessed for antibodies against ABV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and swabs were evaluated for ABV RNA using real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Serum antibodies were detected in birds from all four species and at each sampling site. Thirteen percent of the geese caught on the Toronto Zoo site shed ABV RNA in feces compared with 0% in geese sampled at three other locations. The proportions of shedders among Mute Swans, Trumpeter Swans, and Mallards were 9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. Birds that were shedding viral RNA were more likely to have antibodies against ABV and to have higher antibody levels than those that were not, although many birds with antibodies were not shedding. We confirmed that exposure to, or infection with, ABV is widespread in asymptomatic free-ranging waterfowl in Canada; however, the correlation between cloacal shedding, presence of antibodies, and presence of disease is not fully understood.
402	24766223	Identification and intraspecific genetic diversity of Sarcocystis rileyi from ducks, Anas spp., in Lithuania and Finland.	Prakas P, Oksanen A, Butkauskas D, Sruoga A, Kutkiene L, Svazas S, Isomursu M, Liaugaudaite S	J Parasitol	 2014 Oct;100(5):657-61	 doi: 101645/13-3951 Epub 2014 Apr 25	Macroscopic Sarcocystis cysts were detected in the muscles of 28 Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ), 1 Eurasian Wigeon ( Anas penelope ), and 1 Common Teal ( Anas crecca ) hunted in Lithuania and Finland. According to the sequences of the 18S rRNA gene, 28S rRNA gene, and ITS-1 region, the macrocysts examined from all 30 ducks belonged to Sarcocystis rileyi. This parasite was found in the Eurasian Wigeon and the Common Teal for the first time. All S. rileyi isolates examined were identical to each other and differed from 2 S. rileyi isolates previously reported from 2 Mallards from the United States only by 1 nucleotide substitution within the ITS-1 region.
403	24751587	Biomimicry of multifunctional nanostructures in the neck feathers of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.) drakes.	Khudiyev T, Dogan T, Bayindir M	Sci Rep	 2014 Apr 22;4:4718	 doi: 101038/srep04718	Biological systems serve as fundamental sources of inspiration for the development of artificially colored devices, and their investigation provides a great number of photonic design opportunities. While several successful biomimetic designs have been detailed in the literature, conventional fabrication techniques nonetheless remain inferior to their natural counterparts in complexity, ease of production and material economy. Here, we investigate the iridescent neck feathers of Anas platyrhynchos drakes, show that they feature an unusual arrangement of two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals and further exhibit a superhydrophobic surface, and mimic this multifunctional structure using a nanostructure composite fabricated by a recently developed top-down iterative size reduction method, which avoids the above-mentioned fabrication challenges, provides macroscale control and enhances hydrophobicity through the surface structure. Our 2D solid core photonic crystal fibres strongly resemble drake neck plumage in structure and fully polymeric material composition, and can be produced in wide array of colors by minor alterations during the size reduction process.
404	24696190	Isolation, culture and differentiation of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) preadipocytes.	Ding F, Li QQ, Li L, Gan C, Yuan X, Gou H, He H, Han CC, Wang JW	Cytotechnology	 2015 Oct;67(5):773-81	 doi: 101007/s10616-014-9715-2 Epub 2014 Apr 3	In the present study, we isolated preadipocytes from the adipose tissue of Peking duck and subsequently cultured them in vitro. Cell counting kit-8 assay was employed to establish the growth curve of duck primary preadipocytes. Meanwhile, after the cells reaching full confluency, they were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes by the addition of a cocktail containing dexamethasone, insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and oleic acid for 8 days. Successful differentiation was demonstrated by the development of lipid droplets and the expression of key marker genes including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (CEBP/alpha) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4). Our results showed that duck primary preadipocytes began to adhere 12 h after seeding as short spindle shapes or litter triangles, which grew quickly 3 days post attachment and maintained stable after day 7. After 8 days the preadipocytes were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes, which were stained red by oil red O. Additionally, it showed that during preadipocyte differentiation PPARgamma mRNA was highly expressed at day 3, while CEBP/alpha and FABP4 mRNA peaked at day 5 and 8, respectively. These results indicate that we have successfully isolated and cultured Peking duck preadipocytes and successfully induced them to differentiate into mature adipocytes. This work could lay a foundation for further research into waterfowl adipogenesis.
405	24690373	Is there a relation between genetic or social groups of mallard ducks and the circulation of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses-	De Marco MA, Valentini A, Foni E, Savarese MC, Cotti C, Chiapponi C, Raffini E, Donatelli I, Delogu M	Vet Microbiol	 2014 Jun 4;170(3-4):418-24	 doi: 101016/jvetmic201403001 Epub 2014 Mar 12	We investigated the circulation dynamics of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) reservoir in Italy. In particular, we evaluated the temporal distribution of virologic findings by combining virus isolation data with a new population genetic-based study approach. Thus, during 11 consecutive sampling periods (wintering periods between 1993/94 and 2003/04), categorised into 40 sampling sub-periods, cloacal swab samples were collected from 996 wild and 16 captive-reared mallards, to be screened by RT-PCR before attempting influenza A virus isolation in embryonated eggs. Forty-eight LPAIVs were isolated from wild mallards and antigenically characterised by haemagglutination-inhibition and neuraminidase-inhibition assays. When considering LPAIV antigenic subtypes in which more than one mallard tested virus isolation positive (H1N1, n. 22; H2N3, n. 2; H5N3, n. 2; H6N5, n. 3; H6N8, n. 2; H7N3, n. 3; H11N6, n. 5), at least two birds infected with a specific HN subtype clustered within one same sampling sub-period. In the context of the novel population genetic approach, total DNA was extracted from a subset of 16 captive-reared and 65 wild ducks (2000/01 and 2001/02 sampling periods) to assess genetic diversity by amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers. Analyses of AFLP results showed that captive-reared mallards clustered together, whereas two main independent clusters characterised the distribution pattern of most wild mallards. Within this subset of samples, nearly identical H7N3 LPAIV strains were isolated from two wild mallards belonging to the same genetic cluster. Blood sera were also collected from the above subset of mallards and examined for antibodies to the homologous H7N3 virus strain. Four out of six wild mallards testing H7N3-seropositive by haemagglutination-inhibition assay (2001/02 period) belonged to the genetic cluster including H7N3 virus shedding ducks. Overall, our data raise the possibility of an enhanced transmission and circulation of LPAIVs in genetic or social groups of wild mallards, gathered in flocks possibly related by parentage and/or geographic origin.

Mansouri B, Majnoni F	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	 2014 Apr;92(4):433-9	 doi: 101007/s00128-014-1238-1 Epub 2014 Mar 2	This study was conducted to measure the concentration of several elements (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn) in organs of Coot, Fulica atra, and Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, in order to: (1) determine the significant between metal concentrations in different organs (kidney, liver, pectoral muscle, and feather), (2) to evaluate species differences in metal exposure and accumulation, and (3) to study gender-related trends in metal accumulation. The metal concentrations in organs of F. atra and A. platyrhynchos decreased in the following order: Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. These results revealed that there were no significant differences between males and females except for Cu in liver and feather, and Pb in kidney.

Presswell B, Blasco-Costa I, Kostadinova A	Parasitol Res	 2014 May;113(5):1641-56	 doi: 101007/s00436-014-3809-9 Epub 2014 Feb 23	Two new species of the microphallid genus Maritrema (Maritrema) Nicoll, 1907 are described from freshwaters in the South Island of New Zealand. Maritrema deblocki n. sp. occurs as an adult in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (L.); Maritrema poulini n. sp. is found as sporocysts/cercariae in Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray) and as metacercariae in two species of amphipod and two species of isopod. We use morphological and molecular characterisation to distinguish between the two species, and compare them to their four morphologically closest congeners. M. deblocki n. sp. and M. poulini n. sp. are distinguished from each other by the relative sucker size, the positions of the genital pore and ovary, the convergence of the vitelline ribbons, and overall size. With the aid of molecular data, we matched life cycle stages of M. poulini n. sp. and assessed its use of multiple second intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analyses included sequences for the two new species and the available microphallid sequences for the large ribosomal subunit and the internal transcribed spacer 1 of the ribosomal RNA gene. Closer to each other than to any other species, the sister species together with Maritrema novaezealandense Martorelli, Fredensborg, Mouritsen & Poulin, 2004, Maritrema heardi (Kinsella & Deblock, 1994), Maritrema eroliae Yamaguti, 1939 and Maritrema oocysta (Lebour, 1907) formed a well-supported clade. In addition, we clarify the taxonomic identity of several unidentified Microphallus spp. in the recent ecological literature from New Zealand and propose corrected spellings for a number of Maritrema species epithets.

Li T, Zhao B, Zhou YK, Hu R, Du WG	Am Nat	 2014 Mar;183(3):445-51	 doi: 101086/675065 Epub 2014 Feb 5	Recent studies have demonstrated that thermoregulatory behavior occurs not only in posthatching turtles but also in turtles prior to hatching. Does thermoregulatory behavior also occur in the embryos of other reptile and bird species- Our experiments show that such behavior is widespread but not universal in reptile and bird embryos. We recorded repositioning within the egg, in response to thermal gradients, in the embryos of three species of snakes (Xenochrophis piscator, Elaphe bimaculata, and Zaocys dhumnades), two turtles (Chelydra serpentina and Ocadia sinensis), one crocodile (Alligator sinensis), and four birds (Coturnix coturnix, Gallus gallus domesticus, Columba livia domestica, and Anas platyrhynchos domestica). However, we detected no significant thermoregulation by the embryos of two lizard species (Takydromus septentrionalis and Phrynocephalus frontalis). Overall, embryonic thermoregulatory behavior is widespread in reptile as well as bird species but may be unimportant in the small eggs laid by most lizards.
409	24558569	Lincoln estimates of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) abundance in North America.	Alisauskas RT, Arnold TW, Leafloor JO, Otis DL, Sedinger JS	Ecol Evol	 2014 Jan;4(2):132-43	 doi: 101002/ece3906 Epub 2013 Dec 18	Estimates of range-wide abundance, harvest, and harvest rate are fundamental for sound inferences about the role of exploitation in the dynamics of free-ranging wildlife populations, but reliability of existing survey methods for abundance estimation is rarely assessed using alternative approaches. North American mallard populations have been surveyed each spring since 1955 using internationally coordinated aerial surveys, but population size can also be estimated with Lincoln's method using banding and harvest data. We estimated late summer population size of adult and juvenile male and female mallards in western, midcontinent, and eastern North America using Lincoln's method of dividing (i) total estimated harvest, [Formula: see text], by estimated harvest rate, [Formula: see text], calculated as (ii) direct band recovery rate, [Formula: see text], divided by the (iii) band reporting rate, [Formula: see text]. Our goal was to compare estimates based on Lincoln's method with traditional estimates based on aerial surveys. Lincoln estimates of adult males and females alive in the period June-September were 4.0 (range: 2.5-5.9), 1.8 (range: 0.6-3.0), and 1.8 (range: 1.3-2.7) times larger than respective aerial survey estimates for the western, midcontinent, and eastern mallard populations, and the two population estimates were only modestly correlated with each other (western: r = 0.70, 1993-2011; midcontinent: r = 0.54, 1961-2011; eastern: r = 0.50, 1993-2011). Higher Lincoln estimates are predictable given that the geographic scope of inference from Lincoln estimates is the entire population range, whereas sampling frames for aerial surveys are incomplete. Although each estimation method has a number of important potential biases, our review suggests that underestimation of total population size by aerial surveys is the most likely explanation. In addition to providing measures of total abundance, Lincoln's method provides estimates of fecundity and population sex ratio and could be used in integrated population models to provide greater insights about population dynamics and management of North American mallards and most other harvested species.
410	24555793	Expression of insulin-like growth factor system genes in liver tissue during embryonic and early post-hatch development in duck (Anas platyrhynchos Domestica).	Jianmin Z, Jingting S, Yanju S, Yan H, Chi S, Wenqi Z	Anim Biotechnol	 2014 Apr 3;25(2):73-84	 doi: 101080/104953982013812560	The IGF system is one of the most important endocrine and paracrine growth factor systems that regulate fetal and placental growth, whereas the liver is the principal source of circulation IGF-I. In the present study, expression of IGF-I, IGF type-I receptor (IGF-IR), and IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 genes was quantified by RT-PCR in the liver tissue on days 13, 17, 21, 25, and 27 of embryonic development, as well as at 7 days post-hatching (PH) in meat-type Gaoyou ducks and egg-type Jinding ducks. The results showed that IGF-I mRNA could be detected as early as on E 13d, but the expression level was low throughout embryonic development before increasing dramatically by E 27d and 7 days PH in both duck breeds. However, Gaoyou ducks exhibited higher IGF-I mRNA level than Jinding ducks, and the differences were significant on E 13d, E 21d, and at 7 days PH. Expression of IGF-IR in liver increased gradually in the former stages of the embryonic development, reaching its highest point on E 21d, and then declined up until 7 days PH. The expression pattern of IGFBP-3 gene was similar to that of IGF-IR gene, increasing significantly from E 17d. The expression peak appeared on E 25d, then declined significantly just prior to hatching (day 27) and was followed by an increase at 7 days PH. In general, the expression level of IGF-IR and IGFBP-3 genes in Jinding ducks was higher than that in Gaoyou ducks. Inverse relationships were observed for the expression of IGF-I and IGF-IR, and IGF-I and IGFBP-3, whereas a positive relationship was observed for the expression of IGF-IR and IGFBP-3. Our data indicate a differential expression of selected genes that comprise the IGF system in the duck liver tissue during embryonic and early PH growth and development.

Defilippo F, Luppi A, Maioli G, Marzi D, Fontana MC, Paoli F, Bonilauri P, Dottori M, Merialdi G	J Wildl Dis	 2013 Oct;49(4):1042-6	 doi: 107589/2013-03-072	Over a 7-day period beginning 8 August 2011, a large number of wild birds of several species were found dead or with neurologic clinical signs along the shore of Crostolo stream, in the Emilia Romagna region, Italy. Twenty-eight Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), two Hooded Crows (Corvus corone cornix), and three coypus (Myocastor coypus) were found moribund on the Crostolo stream bank, collected, and sent to Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Reggio Emilia Section. The cause of mortality was determined to be Clostridium botulinum type C toxin. The toxin was identified by a mouse bioassay for botulinum toxins and confirmed in bird sera and blowfly larvae (Lucilia caesar) collected from the stomachs of birds.
412	24502718	Failure of transmission of low-pathogenic avian influenza virus between Mallards and freshwater snails: an experimental evaluation.	Oesterle PT, Huyvaert KP, Orahood D, Mooers N, Sullivan H, Franklin AB, Root JJ	J Wildl Dis	 2013 Oct;49(4):911-9	 doi: 107589/2012-04-111	In aquatic bird populations, the ability of avian influenza (AI) viruses to remain infectious in water for extended periods provides a mechanism that allows viral transmission to occur long after shedding birds have left the area. However, this also exposes other aquatic organisms, including freshwater invertebrates, to AI viruses. Previous researchers found that AI viral RNA can be sequestered in snail tissues. Using an experimental approach, we determined whether freshwater snails (Physa acuta and Physa gyrina) can infect waterfowl with AI viruses by serving as a means of transmission between infected and naive waterfowl via ingestion. In our first experiment, we exposed 20 Physa spp. snails to an AI virus (H3N8) and inoculated embryonated specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs with the homogenized snail tissues. Sequestered AI viruses remain infectious in snail tissues; 10% of the exposed snail tissues infected SPF eggs. In a second experiment, we exposed snails to water contaminated with feces of AI virus-inoculated Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to evaluate whether ingestion of exposed freshwater snails was an alternate route of AI virus transmission to waterfowl. None of the immunologically naive Mallards developed an infection, indicating that transmission via ingestion likely did not occur. Our results suggest that this particular trophic interaction may not play an important role in the transmission of AI viruses in aquatic habitats.
413	24429073	Effects of the regulation of follistatin mRNA expression by IGF-1 in duck (Anas platyrhynchos) skeletal muscle.	Liu H, Li X, Sun L, Wang H, Zhang R, Yang C, Li L, Wang J, He H, Krumm C	Growth Horm IGF Res	 2014 Feb;24(1):35-41	 doi: 101016/jghir201312003 Epub 2013 Dec 29	The IGF-1 and TGF-beta pathways have been shown to be involved in regulating muscle development. Many mediators that are associated with the regulation of muscle development have been found to participate in the cross-talk between these two pathways. To research the relationships between IGF-1 and the follistatin-mediated TGF-beta pathways in duck skeletal muscle development, a series of studies were conducted. The results showed that follistatin had similar expression patterns to IGF-1 during duck embryonic muscle development. The in ovo feeding of IGF-1 to duck eggs was shown to increase follistatin expression in the duck skeletal muscle. Thus, IGF-1 may induce the mRNA expression of follistatin. These results suggest that follistatin may be a key regulator of multiple signaling cascades responding to the cross-talk between the IGF-1 and TGF-beta pathways.
414	24412807	Unraveling molecular mechanistic differences in liver metabolism between lean and fat lines of Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica): a proteomic study.	Zheng A, Chang W, Hou S, Zhang S, Cai H, Chen G, Lou R, Liu G	J Proteomics	 2014 Feb 26;98:271-88	 doi: 101016/jjprot201312021 Epub 2014 Jan 9	Duck is one of the major poultry meat sources for human consumption. To satisfy different eating habits, lean and fat strains of Pekin ducks have been developed. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular mechanistic differences in liver metabolism between two duck strains. The liver proteome of the Pekin duck lines was compared on days 1, 14, 28, and 42 posthatching using 2-DE based proteomics. There was a different abundance of 76 proteins in the livers of the two duck lines. Fat ducks strongly expressed proteins related to pathways of glycolysis, ATP synthesis, and protein catabolism, suggesting enhanced fat deposition rather than protein retention. In contrast, highly expressed proteins in lean ducks improved protein anabolism and reduced protein catabolism, resulting in an enhancement of lean meat deposition. Along with the decrease in fat deposition, the immune system of the lean duck strain may be enhanced by enhanced expression of proteins involved in stress response, immune defense, and antioxidant functions. These results indicate that selection pressure has shaped the two duck lines differently resulting in different liver metabolic capacities. These observed variations between the two strains at the molecular level are matched with physiological changes in growth performance and meat production. This information may have beneficial impacts in areas such as genetic modification through the manipulation of target proteins or genes in specific pathways to improve the efficiency of duck meat production. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The objective of this study was to unravel molecular mechanistic differences in liver metabolism between lean and fat Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) strains. There was a different abundance of 76 proteins in the livers of the two duck lines. Enhanced protein expression in the fat ducks related to pathways of glycolysis, ATP synthesis and protein catabolism suggesting increased fat deposition rather than protein retention. In contrast, highly expressed proteins in the lean ducks facilitated protein deposition by increasing protein anabolism and reducing protein catabolism to enhance the lean meat percentage. Along with the decrease of fat deposition, the immunity of lean duck appeared to be enhanced by increased expression of proteins involved in stress response, defense and antioxidant function. This study provides potential target proteins or genes for further functional analysis and genetic manipulation to increase the efficiency of duck meat production and help satisfy the global demand for poultry meat.
415	24409883	Complete mitochondrial genome of the Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), with phylogenetic analysis in phasianidae.	Zhou TC, Sha T, Irwin DM, Zhang YP	Mitochondrial DNA	 2015;26(6):912-3	 doi: 103109/194017362013863287 Epub 2014 Jan 10	Pavo cristatus, known as the Indian peafowl, is endemic to India and Sri Lanka and has been domesticated for its ornamental and food value. However, its phylogenetic status is still debated. Here, to clarify the phylogenetic status of P. cristatus within Phasianidae, we analyzed its mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome was determined using 34 pairs of primers. Our data show that the mtDNA genome of P. cristatus is 16,686 bp in length. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of P. cristatus was performed along with 22 complete mtDNA genomes belonging to other species in Phasianidae using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, where Aythya americana and Anas platyrhynchos were used as outgroups. Our results show that P. critatus has its closest genetic affinity with Pavo muticus and belongs to clade that contains Gallus, Bambusicola and Francolinus.
416	24394476	Age-related susceptibility to Japanese encephalitis virus in domestic ducklings and chicks.	Cleton NB, Bosco-Lauth A, Page MJ, Bowen RA	Am J Trop Med Hyg	 2014 Feb;90(2):242-6	 doi: 104269/ajtmh13-0161 Epub 2014 Jan 6	Ardeid birds and pigs are known as major amplifying hosts for Japanese encephalitis virus, and ducklings and chickens have been considered to play at best a minor role in outbreaks because of their low or absent viremia. We hypothesized that viremia of sufficient magnitude would develop in young ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) and chicks (Gallus gallus) for them to serve as reservoir hosts and thereby contribute to the transmission cycle. Infection was associated with reduced weight gain in both species, and ducklings infected at 10 days of age or less showed overt clinical signs of disease. The mean peak viremia in birds of both species decreased as the age at infection increased from 2 to 42 days, indicating the importance of age of infection on magnitude of viremia in birds from both species, and suggesting that young poultry may be amplifying hosts of importance in disease-endemic regions.
417	26761677	Meat Species Identification using Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay Targeting Species-specific Mitochondrial DNA.	Cho AR, Dong HJ, Cho S	Korean J Food Sci Anim Resour	 2014;34(6):799-807	 doi: 105851/kosfa2014346799 Epub 2014 Dec 31	Meat source fraud and adulteration scandals have led to consumer demands for accurate meat identification methods. Nucleotide amplification assays have been proposed as an alternative method to protein-based assays for meat identification. In this study, we designed Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays targeting species-specific mitochondrial DNA to identify and discriminate eight meat species; cattle, pig, horse, goat, sheep, chicken, duck, and turkey. The LAMP primer sets were designed and the target genes were discriminated according to their unique annealing temperature generated by annealing curve analysis. Their unique annealing temperatures were found to be 85.56+/-0.07 for cattle, 84.96+/-0.08 for pig, and 85.99+/-0.05 for horse in the BSE-LAMP set (Bos taurus, Sus scrofa domesticus and Equus caballus); 84.91+/-0.11 for goat and 83.90+/-0.11 for sheep in the CO-LAMP set (Capra hircus and Ovis aries); and 86.31+/-0.23 for chicken, 88.66+/-0.12 for duck, and 84.49+/-0.08 for turkey in the GAM-LAMP set (Gallus gallus, Anas platyrhynchos and Meleagris gallopavo). No cross-reactivity was observed in each set. The limits of detection (LODs) of the LAMP assays in raw and cooked meat were determined from 10 pg/muL to 100 fg/muL levels, and LODs in raw and cooked meat admixtures were determined from 0.01% to 0.0001% levels. The assays were performed within 30 min and showed greater sensitivity than that of the PCR assays. These novel LAMP assays provide a simple, rapid, accurate, and sensitive technology for discrimination of eight meat species.
418	26155095	Molecular cloning and sequencing analysis of the interferon beta from Coturnix.	Zheng B, Chang WS	Cent Eur J Immunol	 2014;39(1):25-9	 doi: 105114/ceji201442118 Epub 2014 Apr 17	One pair of primers was designed according to Gallus and Meleagris gallopavo interferon beta (IFN-beta) sequences published in GenBank. The primers and RNA extraction from the spleen of Coturnix were used to amplify Coturnix IFN-beta cDNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The product was cloned into pEasy-T1 vector. Evaluating recombinant plasmid by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. Sequence the cloning sequences, comparing the sequencing results by NCBI. We successfully got a Coturnix IFN-beta partial sequence. The sequence was subtyped and put to homologous analysis. The results suggested the homology of IFN-beta gene of Coturnix and gene of Coturnix and chicken (88.7%), the homology of IFN-beta gene of Coturnix and chicken (88.7%), the homology of IFN-beta gene of Coturnix and Anas platyrhynchos (72.5%), the homology of IFN-beta sequence registered in GenBank. The analysis of the genetic tree showed that the relationship of Coturnix and chicken IFN-beta had a high homology. It can be seen that in this study we successfully got a partial sequence of IFN-beta of quail.
419	24327092	First survey of the occurrence of duck enteritis virus (DEV) in free-ranging Polish water birds.	Wozniakowski G, Samorek-Salamonowicz E	Arch Virol	 2014 Jun;159(6):1439-44	 doi: 101007/s00705-013-1936-8 Epub 2013 Dec 11	Duck plague (DP) caused by anatid herpesvirus 1, also called duck enteritis virus (DEV), presents one of the most important concerns in mass waterfowl production. Apart from geese and ducks, free-ranging water birds are the most notorious infection carriers. The epidemiology of DEV in Western Europe remains unknown. Therefore, it was reasonable to conduct a study on its occurrence using modern but simple real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Analysis of 132 field isolates showed the presence of DEV in 96 birds (72.7 %), and it was found predominantly in wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and mute swans (Cygnus olor). This virus was also found in graylag geese (Anser anser), tundra bean geese (Anser fabalis), and grey herons (Ardea cinerea). The results were recorded as green colour of positive samples, fluorescence under ultraviolet light, and florescent curves in a real-time PCR system. This study indicates the high prevalence of DEV among free-ranging water birds in Poland and the possible transmission to other birds settling in the water environment. This is the first report of DEV detection among free-ranging water birds in Poland.
420	24324871	Band reporting rates of waterfowl: does individual heterogeneity bias estimated survival rates-	White GC, Cordes LS, Arnold TW	Ecol Evol	 2013 Oct;3(12):4215-20	 doi: 101002/ece3791 Epub 2013 Sep 30	In capture-recapture studies, the estimation accuracy of demographic parameters is essential to the efficacy of management of hunted animal populations. Dead recovery models based upon the reporting of rings or bands are often used for estimating survival of waterfowl and other harvested species. However, distance from the ringing site or condition of the bird may introduce substantial individual heterogeneity in the conditional band reporting rates (r), which could cause bias in estimated survival rates (S) or suggest nonexistent individual heterogeneity in S. To explore these hypotheses, we ran two sets of simulations (n = 1000) in MARK using Seber's dead recovery model, allowing time variation on both S and r. This included a series of heterogeneity models, allowing substantial variation on logit(r), and control models with no heterogeneity. We conducted simulations using two different values of S: S = 0.60, which would be typical of dabbling ducks such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and S = 0.80, which would be more typical of sea ducks or geese. We chose a mean reporting rate on the logit scale of -1.9459 with SD = 1.5 for the heterogeneity models (producing a back-transformed mean of 0.196 with SD = 0.196, median = 0.125) and a constant reporting rate for the control models of 0.196. Within these sets of simulations, estimation models where sigmaS = 0 and sigmaS > 0 (sigmaS is SD of individual survival rates on the logit scale) were incorporated to investigate whether real heterogeneity in r would induce apparent individual heterogeneity in S. Models where sigmaS = 0 were selected approximately 91% of the time over models where sigmaS > 0. Simulation results showed < 0.05% relative bias in estimating survival rates except for models estimating sigmaS > 0 when true S = 0.8, where relative bias was a modest 0.5%. These results indicate that considerable variation in reporting rates does not cause major bias in estimated survival rates of waterfowl, further highlighting the robust nature of dead recovery models that are being used for the management of harvested species.
421	24294189	Low metabolic activity of biofilm formed by Enterococcus faecalis isolated from healthy humans and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Meissner W, Jarzembowski TA, Rzyska H, Botelho C, Palubicka A	Ann Microbiol	 2013;63:1477-1482	 doi: 101007/s13213-013-0611-3 Epub 2013 Feb 14	It is widely known that Enterococcus faecalis virulence is related to its biofilm formation. Although Enterococci are common commensal organisms of the gastrointestinal tract, the difference between commensal and pathogen strains remain unclear. In this study, we compare the biochemical profile of the biofilms formed by two groups of medical and two groups of commensal strains. The medical strains were isolated as pathogens from infections of urinary tract and other infections (wounds, pus and bedsores), and the commensal strains were taken from faeces of healthy volunteers and faeces of wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) living in an urban environment. The properties of biofilms formed by medical and commensal strains differed significantly. Commensal strains showed lower metabolic activity and glucose uptake and higher biofilm biomass than the medical ones. Consistent with glucose uptake experiments, we found that the glucose dehydrogenase gene was more expressed in medical strains. These results indicate that higher metabolic activity and lower protein concentration of E. faecalis cells within biofilms are formed during infections.
422	24283133	Low pathogenic influenza A virus activity at avian interfaces in Ohio zoos, 2006-2009.	Nolting JM, Dennis P, Long L, Holtvoigt L, Brown D, King MJ, Shellbarger W, Hanley C, Killian ML, Slemons RD	Avian Dis	 2013 Sep;57(3):657-62	 doi: 101637/10528-031313-Reg1	This investigation to examine influenza A virus activity in avian species at four Ohio zoos was initiated to better understand the ecology of avian-origin influenza A (AIV) virus in wild aquatic birds and the possibility of spill-over of such viruses into captive zoo birds, both native and foreign species. Virus isolation efforts resulted in the recovery of three low pathogenic (LP) AIV isolates (one H7N3 and two H3N6) from oral-pharyngeal or cloacal swabs collected from over 1000 zoo birds representing 94 species. In addition, 21 LPAIV isolates possessing H3N6, H4N6, or H7N3 subtype combinations were recovered from 627 (3.3%) environmental fecal samples collected from outdoor habitats accessible to zoo and wild birds. Analysis of oral-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs collected from free-ranging mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) live-trapped at one zoo in 2007 resulted in the recovery of 164 LPAIV isolates (48% of samples) representing five HA and six NA subtypes and at least nine HA-NA combinations. The high frequency of isolate recovery is undoubtedly due to the capture and holding of wild ducks in a common pen before relocation. Serologic analyses using an agar gel immune diffusion assay detected antibodies to the influenza A virus type-specific antigen in 147 of 1237 (11.9%) zoo bird sera and in 14 of 154 (9%) wild mallard sera. Additional analyses of a limited number of zoo bird sera demonstrated HA- and NA-inhibition activity to 15 HA and nine NA subtypes. The spectrum of HA antibodies indicate antibody diversity of AIV infecting zoo birds; however, the contribution of heterologous cross-reactions and steric interference was not ruled out. This proactive investigation documented that antigenically diverse LPAIVs were active in all three components of the avian zoologic-wild bird interfaces at Ohio zoos (zoo birds, the environment, and wild birds). The resulting baseline data provides insight and justification for preventive medicine strategies for zoo birds.
423	24192340	Evaluation of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibodies against the H5 subtype of Influenza A virus in waterfowl.	Lebarbenchon C, Pantin-Jackwood M, Kistler WM, Luttrell MP, Spackman E, Stallknecht DE, Brown JD	Influenza Other Respir Viruses	 2013 Nov;7(6):1237-40	 doi: 101111/irv12070 Epub 2012 Dec 22	The ID Screen Influenza H5 Antibody Competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was tested for the detection of antibodies to the H5 subtype of influenza A (IA) virus in waterfowl. Assays were conducted with sera obtained from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Pekin Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica), experimentally infected with eight low pathogenic (LP) and nine highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 IA viral strains. Three incubation periods (1, 4 and 18 hours) and two dilutions (1:2 and 1:5) were tested. All serum samples from LP H5-infected birds tested positive; however, improved detection rates were observed for viruses belonging to the HP H5N1 clade 2.2.1 as compared with those belonging to clade 2.1.3.
424	24180358	MyoD and Myf6 gene expression patterns in skeletal muscle during embryonic and posthatch development in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Li H, Zhu C, Tao Z, Xu W, Song W, Hu Y, Zhu W, Song C	J Anim Breed Genet	 2014 Jun;131(3):194-201	 doi: 101111/jbg12057 Epub 2013 Nov 4	The MyoD and Myf6 genes, which are muscle regulatory factors (MRFs), play major roles in muscle growth and development and initiate muscle fibre formation via the regulation of muscle-specific gene translation. Therefore, MyoD and Myf6 are potential candidate genes for meat production traits in animals and poultry. The objective of this study was to evaluate MyoD and Myf6 gene expression patterns in the skeletal muscle during early developmental stage of ducks. Gene expression levels were detected using the quantitative RT-PCR method in the breast muscle (BM) and leg muscle (LM) at embryonic days 13, 17, 21, 25, 27, as well as at 1 week posthatching in Gaoyou and Jinding ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). The MyoD and Myf6 gene profiles in the two duck breeds were consistent during early development, and MyoD gene expression showed a 'wave' trend in BM and an approximate 'anti- radical' trend in LM. Myf6 gene expression in BM showed the highest level at embryonic day 21, which subsequently decreased, although remained relatively high, while levels at embryonic days 13, 17 and 21 were higher in LM. The results of correlation analysis showed that MyoD and Myf6 gene expression levels were more strongly correlated in LM than in BM in both duck breeds. These results indicated that different expression patterns of the MyoD and Myf6 genes in BM and LM may be related to muscle development and differentiation, suggesting that MyoD and Myf6 are integral to skeletal muscle development.
425	24160690	Is Opisthorchis viverrini an avian liver fluke-	Nawa Y, Doanh PN, Thaenkham U	J Helminthol	 2015 Mar;89(2):255-6	 doi: 101017/S0022149X13000709 Epub 2013 Oct 25	Recently, in the Journal of Helminthology (May 2013), Dao et al. reported that Opisthorchis viverrini-like flukes were found in the bile duct of domestic ducks in Vietnam. They stated that this is the first record of Opisthorchis sp. in birds in Vietnam. However, three Opisthorchis species--O. cheelis, O. longissimus and O. parageminus--in birds in Vietnam were described by Le in 2000. Amongst these, O. parageminus was first reported, by Oshmarin in 1970, as a new Opisthorchis species found in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in Vietnam. Morphologially O. viverrini-like flukes described by Dao et al. are much more similar to O. parageminus than to O. viverrini. The phylogenetic trees of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) gene sequences also showed that the O. viverrini-like liver flukes from domestic ducks were closer to O. lobatus than to O. viverrini. Therefore, O. viverrini-like liver flukes reported by Dao et al. (2013) are most likely to be O. parageminus.
426	24146753	Avian influenza infection alters fecal odor in mallards.	Kimball BA, Yamazaki K, Kohler D, Bowen RA, Muth JP, Opiekun M, Beauchamp GK	PLoS One	 2013 Oct 16;8(10):e75411	 doi: 101371/journalpone0075411 eCollection 2013	Changes in body odor are known to be a consequence of many diseases. Much of the published work on disease-related and body odor changes has involved parasites and certain cancers. Much less studied have been viral diseases, possibly due to an absence of good animal model systems. Here we studied possible alteration of fecal odors in animals infected with avian influenza viruses (AIV). In a behavioral study, inbred C57BL/6 mice were trained in a standard Y-maze to discriminate odors emanating from feces collected from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza virus compared to fecal odors from non-infected controls. Mice could discriminate odors from non-infected compared to infected individual ducks on the basis of fecal odors when feces from post-infection periods were paired with feces from pre-infection periods. Prompted by this indication of odor change, fecal samples were subjected to dynamic headspace and solvent extraction analyses employing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify chemical markers indicative of AIV infection. Chemical analyses indicated that AIV infection was associated with a marked increase of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) in feces. These experiments demonstrate that information regarding viral infection exists via volatile metabolites present in feces. Further, they suggest that odor changes following virus infection could play a role in regulating behavior of conspecifics exposed to infected individuals.
427	24130732	Quantitative and qualitative approaches to identifying migration chronology in a continental migrant.	Beatty WS, Kesler DC, Webb EB, Raedeke AH, Naylor LW, Humburg DD	PLoS One	 2013 Oct 9;8(10):e75673	 doi: 101371/journalpone0075673 eCollection 2013	The degree to which extrinsic factors influence migration chronology in North American waterfowl has not been quantified, particularly for dabbling ducks. Previous studies have examined waterfowl migration using various methods, however, quantitative approaches to define avian migration chronology over broad spatio-temporal scales are limited, and the implications for using different approaches have not been assessed. We used movement data from 19 female adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) equipped with solar-powered global positioning system satellite transmitters to evaluate two individual level approaches for quantifying migration chronology. The first approach defined migration based on individual movements among geopolitical boundaries (state, provincial, international), whereas the second method modeled net displacement as a function of time using nonlinear models. Differences in migration chronologies identified by each of the approaches were examined with analysis of variance. The geopolitical method identified mean autumn migration midpoints at 15 November 2010 and 13 November 2011, whereas the net displacement method identified midpoints at 15 November 2010 and 14 November 2011. The mean midpoints for spring migration were 3 April 2011 and 20 March 2012 using the geopolitical method and 31 March 2011 and 22 March 2012 using the net displacement method. The duration, initiation date, midpoint, and termination date for both autumn and spring migration did not differ between the two individual level approaches. Although we did not detect differences in migration parameters between the different approaches, the net displacement metric offers broad potential to address questions in movement ecology for migrating species. Ultimately, an objective definition of migration chronology will allow researchers to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the extrinsic factors that drive migration at the individual and population levels. As a result, targeted conservation plans can be developed to support planning for habitat management and evaluation of long-term climate effects.
428	24126784	Silencing Pax3 by shRNA inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) myoblasts.	Zhang RP, Liu HH, Wang HH, Wang Y, Han CC, Li L, He H, Xu HY, Xu F, Wang JW	Mol Cell Biochem	 2014 Jan;386(1-2):211-22	 doi: 101007/s11010-013-1859-4 Epub 2013 Oct 15	The Pax3 gene has been proven to play a crucial role in determining myogenic progenitor cell fate during embryonic myogenesis; however, the molecular role of Pax3 in myoblast development during later stages of myogenesis is unknown. We hypothesized that Pax3 would function in myoblast proliferation and differentiation; therefore, we employed three short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (shRNA1, shRNA2, and shRNA3) that target Pax3 to characterize the function of Pax3 in duck myoblast development. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Pax3 in duck myoblasts were detected using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT and BrdU assays, while cell differentiation was assayed using immunofluorescence labeling with a MyoG antibody. Additionally, folic acid (FA), which is a rescue tool, was added into the medium of duck myoblasts to indirectly examine the function of Pax3 on duck myoblast proliferation and differentiation. The results revealed that one of the shRNA vectors, shRNA1, could significantly and stably reduce the expression of Pax3 (P < 0.05). Silencing Pax3 by shRNA1 significantly reduced the proliferation and differentiation of duck myoblasts (P < 0.05) due to downregulated expression of myogenic regulator factors. These trends could be rescued by adding FA; and Pax7, a paralog gene of Pax3, was involved in those processes. Overall, Pax3 had a positive function in duck myoblast proliferation and differentiation by modulating the expression of myogenic regulation factors, and shRNA targeting of Pax3 might be a new approach for understanding the function of Pax3 in the development of diverse tissues.
429	24116183	Comparative proteomic analysis of the hepatic response to heat stress in Muscovy and Pekin ducks: insight into thermal tolerance related to energy metabolism.	Zeng T, Jiang X, Li J, Wang D, Li G, Lu L, Wang G	PLoS One	 2013 Oct 7;8(10):e76917	 doi: 101371/journalpone0076917 eCollection 2013	The Pekin duck, bred from the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) in china, is one of the most famous meat duck species in the world. However, it is more sensitive to heat stress than Muscovy duck, which is believed to have originated in South America. With temperature raising, mortality, laying performance, and meat quality of the Pekin duck are severely affected. This study aims to uncover the temperature-dependent proteins of two duck species using comparative proteomic approach. Duck was cultured under 39 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C for 1 h, and then immediately returned to 20 degrees C for a 3 h recovery period, the liver proteins were extracted and electrophoresed in two-dimensional mode. After analysis of gel images, 61 differentially expressed proteins were detected, 54 were clearly identified by MALDI TOF/TOF MS. Of the 54 differentially expressed protein spots identified, 7 were found in both species, whereas 47 were species specific (25 in Muscovy duck and 22 in Pekin duck). As is well known, chaperone proteins, such as heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and HSP10, were abundantly up-regulated in both species in response to heat stress. However, we also found that several proteins, such as alpha-enolase, and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, showed different expression patterns in the 2 duck species. The enriched biological processes were grouped into 3 main categories according to gene ontology analysis: cell death and apoptosis (20.93%), amino acid metabolism (13.95%) and oxidation reduction (20.93%). The mRNA levels of several differentially expressed protein were investigated by real-time RT-PCR. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide insights into the differential expression of proteins following heat stress in ducks and enables better understanding of possible heat stress response mechanisms in animals.

Vasai F, Brugirard Ricaud K, Bernadet MD, Cauquil L, Bouchez O, Combes S, Davail S	FEMS Microbiol Ecol	 2014 Jan;87(1):204-16	 doi: 101111/1574-694112217 Epub 2013 Oct 10	To investigate the effect of overfeeding on the ileal and cecal microbiota of two genotypes of ducks (Pekin and Muscovy), high-throughput 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing was used. The ducks were overfed for 12 days with 58% maize flour and 42% maize grain. Samples were collected before the overfeeding period (at 12 weeks), at 13 weeks, at 14 weeks, and 3 h after feeding. In parallel, ducks fed ad libitum were killed at the same ages. Whatever the digestive segment, the genotype, and the level of intake, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the dominant phyla in the bacterial community of ducks (at least 80%). Before overfeeding, ileal samples were dominated by Bacilli, Clostridia, and Bacteroidia classes (>/= 70%), and cecal samples, by Bacteroidia and Clostridia classes (around 90%) in both Pekin and Muscovy ducks. The richness and diversity decreased in the ileum and increased in the ceca after overfeeding. Overfeeding triggers major changes in the ileum, whereas the ceca are less affected. Overfeeding increased the relative abundance of Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Enterococcaceae families in the ileum, whereas genotype affects particularly three families: Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Desulfovibrionaceae in the ceca.
431	24076354	Identification and expression analysis of the leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT2) gene in duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Xu Q, Chen Y, Tong YY, Huang ZY, Zhao WM, Duan XJ, Zhang Y, Li X, Chang GB, Chen GH	Gene	 2014 Jan 1;533(1):280-5	 doi: 101016/jgene201309047 Epub 2013 Sep 26	Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), first identified as a chemotactic factor, is involved in the regulation of liver regeneration, carcinogenesis, and natural killer T-cell homeostasis in mammals. The function of LECT2 in the duck remains unclear, however. A suppression subtractive cDNA library was constructed from the livers of 3-day-old ducklings treated with duck hepatitis virus type I (DHV-1). A total of 66 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified in the libraries. Among the novel gene fragments identified was the LECT2 gene. Full-length duck LECT2 (duLECT2) complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA consisted of a 50 nucleotide 5' untranslated region (UTR), an 84 nucleotide 3' UTR, and a 1020 nucleotide open reading frame encoding a single protein of 339 amino acids. In agreement with a previously reported LECT2 sequence, the predicted amino acid sequence contains characteristic phosphorylation and N-glycosylation sites. DuLECT2 is highly similar to LECT2 genes from other vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the LECT2 gene has been highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. RT-PCR analyses revealed that duLECT2 mRNA is widely expressed in healthy tissues. They also showed that duLECT2 mRNA is significantly up-regulated in the liver and spleen following injection with DHV-1 or polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C), peaking 4 or 12h post-challenge in the liver and spleen, respectively, and afterwards gradually returning to normal. Our findings suggest that duLECT2 contributes to the innate immune response against viral infections.
432	24033258	Juveniles and migrants as drivers for seasonal epizootics of avian influenza virus.	van Dijk JG, Hoye BJ, Verhagen JH, Nolet BA, Fouchier RA, Klaassen M	J Anim Ecol	 2014 Jan;83(1):266-75	 doi: 101111/1365-265612131 Epub 2013 Sep 4	Similar to other infectious diseases, the prevalence of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) has been seen to exhibit marked seasonal variation. However, mechanisms driving this variation in wild birds have yet to be tested. We investigated the validity of three previously suggested drivers for the seasonal dynamics in LPAIV infections in wild birds: (i) host density, (ii) immunologically naive young and (iii) increased susceptibility in migrants. To address these questions, we sampled a key LPAIV host species, the mallard Anas platyrhynchos, on a small spatial scale, comprehensively throughout a complete annual cycle, measuring both current and past infection (i.e. viral and seroprevalence, respectively). We demonstrate a minor peak in LPAIV prevalence in summer, a dominant peak in autumn, during which half of the sampled population was infected, and no infections in spring. Seroprevalence of antibodies to a conserved gene segment of avian influenza virus (AIV) peaked in winter and again in spring. The summer peak of LPAIV prevalence coincided with the entrance of unfledged naive young in the population. Moreover, juveniles were more likely to be infected, shed higher quantities of virus and were less likely to have detectable antibodies to AIV than adult birds. The arrival of migratory birds, as identified by stable hydrogen isotope analysis, appeared to drive the autumn peak in LPAIV infection, with both temporal coincidence and higher infection prevalence in migrants. Remarkably, seroprevalence in migrants was substantially lower than viral prevalence throughout autumn migration, further indicating that each wave of migrants amplified local AIV circulation. Finally, while host abundance increased throughout autumn, it peaked in winter, showing no direct correspondence with either of the LPAIV infection peaks. At an epidemiologically relevant spatial scale, we provide strong evidence for the role of migratory birds as key drivers for seasonal epizootics of LPAIV, regardless of their role as vectors of these viruses. This study exemplifies the importance of understanding host demography and migratory behaviour when examining seasonal drivers of infection in wildlife populations.
433	24028398	Prevalence of avian paramyxovirus type 1 in Mallards during autumn migration in the western Baltic Sea region.	Tolf C, Wille M, Haidar AK, Avril A, Zohari S, Waldenstrom J	Virol J	 2013 Sep 12;10:285	 doi: 101186/1743-422X-10-285	BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is the causative agent of the Newcastle disease, a severe disease in birds associated with substantial economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Sweden is situated along the Western European waterfowl flyway and applies a non-vaccination policy combined with directives of immediate euthanisation of NDV infected flocks. During the last decades there have been several outbreaks with NDV in poultry in Sweden. However, less is known about the virus prevalence in the wild bird population including waterfowl, a well-established reservoir of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1), the paramyxovirus serotype that include pathogenic NDV. METHODS: The survey constituted of 2332 samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), trapped in the southern part of Sweden during autumn migration in 2010. These samples were screened for APMV-1 by real-time reverse transcription PCR, and viral strains from positive samples were isolated and characterized by sequence analysis of the fusion gene and by phylogenetic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty of these samples were positive for APMV-1, hence a virus prevalence of 0.9% (95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]=0.54%, 1.35%). The highest APMV-1 prevalence was detected in juvenile Mallards sampled in November (n=887, prevalence 1.24% ([95% CI])=0.67%, 2.24%). Sequence analysis and evaluation of phylogenetic relatedness indicated that isolated APMV-1 strains were lentogenic, and phylogenetically most closely related to genotype Ib strains within the clade of class II viruses. The sampling system employed enabled us to follow APMV-1 infections and the shedding of one particular viral strain in one individual bird over several days. Furthermore, combining previous screening results with the APMV-1 detections in this study showed that more than 50% of Mallards that tested positive for APMV-1 RNA were co-infected with influenza A virus.
434	24023629	Flexibility of continental navigation and migration in European mallards.	van Toor ML, Hedenstrom A, Waldenstrom J, Fiedler W, Holland RA, Thorup K, Wikelski M	PLoS One	 2013 Aug 30;8(8):e72629	 doi: 101371/journalpone0072629 eCollection 2013	The ontogeny of continent-wide navigation mechanisms of the individual organism, despite being crucial for the understanding of animal movement and migration, is still poorly understood. Several previous studies, mainly conducted on passerines, indicate that inexperienced, juvenile birds may not generally correct for displacement during fall migration. Waterbirds such as the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos, Linnaeus 1758) are more flexible in their migration behavior than most migratory songbirds, but previous experiments with waterbirds have not yet allowed clear conclusions about their navigation abilities. Here we tested whether immature mallard ducks correct for latitudinal displacement during fall migration within Europe. During two consecutive fall migration periods, we caught immature females on a stopover site in southeast Sweden, and translocated a group of them ca. 1,000 km to southern Germany. We followed the movements of the ducks via satellite GPS-tracking and observed their migration decisions during the fall and consecutive spring migration. The control animals released in Ottenby behaved as expected from banding recoveries: they continued migration during the winter and in spring returned to the population's breeding grounds in the Baltics and Northwest Russia. Contrary to the control animals, the translocated mallards did not continue migration and stayed at Lake Constance. In spring, three types of movement tactics could be observed: 61.5% of the ducks (16 of 26) stayed around Lake Constance, 27% (7 of 26) migrated in a northerly direction towards Sweden and 11.5% of the individuals (3 of 26) headed east for ca. 1,000 km and then north. We suggest that young female mallards flexibly adjust their migration tactics and develop a navigational map that allows them to return to their natal breeding area.
435	23994490	Phylogenetics of a recent radiation in the mallards and allies (Aves: Anas): inferences from a genomic transect and the multispecies coalescent.	Lavretsky P, McCracken KG, Peters JL	Mol Phylogenet Evol	 2014 Jan;70:402-11	 doi: 101016/jympev201308008 Epub 2013 Aug 27	Reconstructing species trees by incorporating information from many independent gene trees reduces the confounding influence of stochastic lineage sorting. Such analyses are particularly important for taxa that share polymorphisms due to incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization. We investigated phylogenetic relationships among 14 closely related taxa from the mallard (Anas spp.) complex using the multispecies coalescent and 20 nuclear loci sampled from a genomic transect. We also examined how treating recombining loci and hybridizing species influences results by partitioning the data using various protocols. In general, topologies were similar among the various species trees, with major clades consistently composed of the same taxa. However, relationships among these clades and among taxa within clades changed among partitioned data sets. Posterior support generally decreased when filtering for recombination, whereas excluding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) increased posterior support for taxa known to hybridize with them. Furthermore, branch lengths decreased substantially for recombination-filtered data. Finally, concordance between nuclear and morphometric topologies conflicted with those in the mitochondrial tree, particularly with regard to the placement of the Hawaiian duck (A. wyvilliana), Philippine duck (A. luzonica), and two spot-billed ducks (A. zonorhyncha and A. poecilorhyncha). These results demonstrate the importance of maximizing sequence length and taxon sampling when inferring taxonomic relationships that are confounded by extensive allele sharing.
436	23973707	Reproductive effort and success of wild female mallards: does male quality matter-	Sheppard JL, Clark RG, Devries JH, Brasher MG	Behav Processes	 2013 Nov;100:82-90	 doi: 101016/jbeproc201307024 Epub 2013 Aug 22	In accordance with the differential allocation hypothesis, females are expected to increase their reproductive investment when mated to high-quality males. In waterfowl, reproductive, investment increased when captive female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were mated to more attractive males, but information for wild ducks is lacking. Studies of waterfowl mating systems have focused primarily on the importance of plumage coloration of males and female mate choice, whereas investigations of reproductive ecology examine female attributes and virtually ignore the role of males in investment decisions. Here, we used unique data for 253 pairs of wild mallards to test whether females mated to high-quality males would increase reproductive effort and reproduce more successfully. We derived measurements of female and male body size and condition, and indices of male plumage quality, and related these traits to patterns of reproductive effort and performance of females. Consistent with predictions, yearling females nested earlier and had higher nest survival when mated to males with better plumage scores. Furthermore, when paired with larger bodied males, yearling females renested more often, and nest and brood survival increased among older females. Although the strength of male effects varied with breeding stage and female age or experience, this is one of a few studies to demonstrate an additive effect of male quality on investment and success of females, in free-ranging birds.
437	23967575	Time-lagged variation in pond density and primary productivity affects duck nest survival in the Prairie Pothole Region.	Walker J, Rotella JJ, Stephens SE, Lindberg MS, Ringelman JK, Hunter C, Smith AJ	Ecol Appl	 2013 Jul;23(5):1061-74	 doi: 101890/12-17551	The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is the primary breeding region for most species of North American dabbling ducks (Anas spp.). Conservation of these species is guided in part by knowledge of relationships between nest survival probability and habitat features. Positive relationships between duck nest survival and amount and configuration of herbaceous perennial vegetation have been observed in previous studies, but these 2- to 4-year studies might not have adequately characterized the temporal effect of wet-dry episodes on nest survival. Over an eight-year period, we studied nest survival of five species of ducks in the PPR relative to spatial and temporal variation in pond density, primary productivity, and hydrologic status of wetlands, soil, and vegetation on 52 study sites selected to span a gradient of spatial variation in proportion of herbaceous perennial vegetation and in number of wetland basins. We observed the fate of 12 754 nests. Consistent with past studies, 90% of nests that failed to hatch were destroyed by predators. Nest survival probability was positively related to current-year pond density and primary productivity, negatively related to pond density and primary productivity during the previous two years, and positively related to the number of wetland basins on the study site. Predicted relationships between nest survival and proportion or configuration of herbaceous perennial vegetation in the surrounding landscape were not supported. For mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), median estimated nest survival probability ranged from 0.02 (SE = 0.01) to 0.22 (SE = 0.02). Estimated nest survival was greatest on sites with numerous wetland basins that had transitioned from dry, unproductive conditions to wet, productive conditions in the previous 1-2 years. Our results were consistent with time-lagged responses of food webs to resource pulses in a broad array of ecosystems. Our study highlighted the importance of wetland basins and wet-dry episodes to duck nest survival in the PPR. Current habitat conservation efforts focus on landscapes with numerous wetland basins and a high proportion of herbaceous perennial vegetation. Our results suggest that future conservation efforts should focus on preserving high-density wetland complexes across as large a geographic extent as possible even in cropland-dominated landscapes.
438	23964992	The influence of crate height on selected biochemical indices in captive-reared mallards.	Bedanova I, Voslarova E, Chloupek J, Pistekova V, Forejtek P, Passantino A	Anim Sci J	 2014 Mar;85(3):318-22	 doi: 101111/asj12106 Epub 2013 Aug 22	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of crate type (particularly its height) on selected biochemical indices in captive-reared mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). The physiological changes in response to 2-h crating in crates of either 20 cm or 26 cm height were monitored in 6-week-old mallards. Plasma corticosterone concentrations showed an increase (P = 0.036) in mallards crated in crates of 26 cm height in comparison with control non-crated birds, whereas no difference in plasma corticosterone levels was found between mallards crated in crates of 20 cm height and control non-crated birds. Lower concentrations of plasma triglycerides (P < 0.05) and uric acid (P < 0.05) were found in crated mallards in comparison with control non-crated birds; the height of the crates had no effect. Mallards crated in crates of 26 cm height also exhibited a higher (P = 0.032) plasma lactate dehydrogenase concentration in comparison with control non-crated birds, whereas no difference (P > 0.05) was found in lactate dehydrogenase concentrations in mallards crated in crates of 20 cm height. Our results suggest that crating mallards in lower crates (20 cm) may be less stressful than keeping them in crates allowing vertical movements of the birds.
439	23951116	Resistance mutation R292K is induced in influenza A(H6N2) virus by exposure of infected mallards to low levels of oseltamivir.	Gillman A, Muradrasoli S, Soderstrom H, Nordh J, Brojer C, Lindberg RH, Latorre-Margalef N, Waldenstrom J, Olsen B, Jarhult JD	PLoS One	 2013 Aug 12;8(8):e71230	 doi: 101371/journalpone0071230 eCollection 2013	Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) is problematic as these drugs constitute the major treatment option for severe influenza. Extensive use of the NAI oseltamivir (Tamiflu(R)) results in up to 865 ng/L of its active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in river water. There one of the natural reservoirs of influenza A, dabbling ducks, can be exposed. We previously demonstrated that an influenza A(H1N1) virus in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) exposed to 1 microg/L of OC developed oseltamivir resistance through the mutation H274Y (N2-numbering). In this study, we assessed the resistance development in an A(H6N2) virus, which belongs to the phylogenetic N2 group of neuraminidases with distinct functional and resistance characteristics. Mallards were infected with A(H6N2) while exposed to 120 ng/L, 1.2 microg/L or 12 microg/L of OC in their sole water source. After 4 days with 12 microg/L of OC exposure, the resistance mutation R292K emerged and then persisted. Drug sensitivity was decreased approximately 13,000-fold for OC and approximately 7.8-fold for zanamivir. Viral shedding was similar when comparing R292K and wild-type virus indicating sustained replication and transmission. Reduced neuraminidase activity and decrease in recovered virus after propagation in embryonated hen eggs was observed in R292K viruses. The initial, but not the later R292K isolates reverted to wild-type during egg-propagation, suggesting a stabilization of the mutation, possibly through additional mutations in the neuraminidase (D113N or D141N) or hemagglutinin (E216K). Our results indicate a risk for OC resistance development also in a N2 group influenza virus and that exposure to one NAI can result in a decreased sensitivity to other NAIs as well. If established in influenza viruses circulating among wild birds, the resistance could spread to humans via re-assortment or direct transmission. This could potentially cause an oseltamivir-resistant pandemic; a serious health concern as preparedness plans rely heavily on oseltamivir before vaccines can be mass-produced.

Uddin M, Quasem MA, Rhaman ML	Anat Histol Embryol	 2013 Dec;42(6):471-8	 doi: 101111/ahe12079 Epub 2013 Aug 12	In this study, retinal whole-mount specimens were prepared and stained with 0.1% cresyl violet for the ganglion cell study in the native duck (Anas platyrhynchos). The total number, distribution and size of these cells were determined in different retinal regions. The mean total number of ganglion cells was 1 598 501. The retinal area centralis had the highest ganglion cell density with 11 200 cells/mm(2) . Number of ganglion cell bodies was the highest in temporal area, followed by dorsal, nasal and ventral areas. Ganglion cell size ranged from 5.25 to 80 mum(2) . In the temporal and nasal region, most of the cells were ranged from 15 to 25 mum(2) , and in the dorsal and ventral region, most of the cells were ranged from 12 to 25 mum(2) . There was a marked trend for the retinal ganglion cell size to increase as the population density decrease towards the periphery. A population of small ganglion cells persisted into the central area just above the optic disc and the largest soma area was in the ventral zone of the retina. Thus, the specialisation of ganglion cell densities and their sizes support the notion that the conduction of visual information towards the brain from all regions of the retina is not uniform, and the central area is the fine quality area for vision in native duck.
441	23916865	Vaccination of domestic ducks against H5N1 HPAI: a review.	Pantin-Jackwood MJ, Suarez DL	Virus Res	 2013 Dec 5;178(1):21-34	 doi: 101016/jvirusres201307012 Epub 2013 Aug 3	Domestic ducks play an important role in the epidemiology of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Consequently, successful control of H5N1 HPAI in ducks is important for the eradication of the disease in poultry and in preventing infections in humans. Domestic ducks, however, include different species and breeds, and the susceptibility to infection, disease and response to vaccination can vary depending on the species and age of the bird. Most domestic duck species are descendants of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), but in Asian countries Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) are also commonly farmed. Current vaccines and vaccination practices are insufficient for the control of H5N1 HPAI virus infections in domestic waterfowl and new vaccination strategies are needed. Although vaccination has proven effective in protecting ducks against disease, shedding of the virus still occurs in clinically healthy vaccinated populations. To improve protection of ducks against H5N1 HPAI, vaccination programs must take into account the susceptibility of ducks to circulating viruses and the particular production systems and husbandry practices of the country. Vaccination needs to be implemented as part of a comprehensive control strategy that also includes biosecurity, surveillance, education and elimination of infected poultry.
442	23916689	Molecular characterization, expression patterns, and subcellular localization of RIG-I in the Jinding duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Chen Y, Zhang Y, Huang Z, Xu Q, Zhu Z, Tong Y, Yu Q, Ding J, Chen G	Dev Comp Immunol	 2013 Dec;41(4):766-71	 doi: 101016/jdci201307018 Epub 2013 Aug 2	Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) have recently been identified as cytoplasmic sensors for RNA virus. Recent research has shown that RIG-I, a member of this family, play an important role in innate immunity. In this study, we cloned the RIG-I gene from Jinding duck by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). We determined that the cDNA of duRIG-I contains a 14-bp 5' UTR, a 2802-bp open reading frame, and alternative 3' UTRs (295-bp and 927-bp) and encodes a polypeptide of 933 amino acids. Based on this sequence, the duRIG-I protein is predicted to have conserved domains typical of RLRs. In addition, duRIG-I was found to be distributed throughout DF1 cells by indirect immunofluorescence, as predicted. duRIG-I mRNA was scarcely detected in healthy tissues by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (sqRT-PCR). To study the role of RIG-I in innate immunity, we used synthetic double-stranded RNA to mimic viral infection in vivo and detected duRIG-I transcripts in spleen and liver by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of duRIG-I mRNA was significantly elevated at 8h post-injection (P < 0.05) and was indistinguishable from control levels at other time points (P > 0.05). These results suggest that duRIG-I plays an important role in innate immune responses to double-stranded RNA viruses and warrant further studies to reveal the possible mechanism.
443	23914249	Survey of Migratory Birds (Anatidae: Anas platyrhynchos) for Schistosome Parasites from Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran.	Mahdavi S, Farahnak A, Mobedi I, Rad MM, Azadeh H	Iran J Parasitol	 2013 Apr;8(2):333-6		BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to survey birds' schistosomes in migratory birds (Anatidae: Anas platyrhynchos) which are the source of the disease in Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran. METHODS: A number of mallards were bought from the markets of hunted birds. The respiratory tracts (nasal mucosa) and intestinal blood vessels were studied for adult worms. The nasal mucosa was separated and observed by a microscope. In order to separate the visceral schistosomes, after separating intestine, vessel mesenteric was studied under the lamp light and then in saline. The parasite sample was collected for subsequent observation. RESULTS: Fifteen (13.6%) cases out of 110 studied birds had nasal mucosa contaminated with Trichobilharzia sp. egg. Besides that, two birds had adult worms schistosome visceral i.e. Bilharziella sp. CONCLUSION: The elements that cause cercarial dermatitis in aforementioned region are Trichobilharzia sp. and Bilharziella sp. parasites. Thus, it is necessary for the authorities of health, environmental and agricultural organization of the province to cooperate in order to control this disease.
444	23911982	Carotenoid supplementation during adulthood, but not development, decreases testis size in mallards.	Butler MW, Karanfilian B, Homsher M, McGraw KJ	Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol	 2013 Nov;166(3):465-9	 doi: 101016/jcbpa201307024 Epub 2013 Jul 31	Nutritional constraints on reproduction are well-characterized in female animals, but rarely have particular nutrients been linked to male reproductive investments. Carotenoid pigments promote egg-laying and fertility in several animals, and are displayed externally within secondary sex traits by males of many colorful species to attract mates, but it is unclear if or how carotenoids affect male primary sex traits. We manipulated carotenoid availability in the diet of male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during both development and adulthood to determine effects on size and carotenoid content of the testes. We found that developmental carotenoid manipulations did not affect testis size or carotenoid concentration, but that increased carotenoid dietary levels at adulthood resulted in more carotenoid-rich, but smaller, testes. This latter result was surprising, given positive correlations in mammals between testicle size and carotenoid concentration. We also found negative correlations between testis size and carotenoid concentration for individual ducks, regardless of dietary treatment. These results suggest that carotenoid deposition into testis tissue can reduce investment in gonad size (and thus overall sperm count), although the functional consequences of this relationship remain to be tested.
445	23876184	Effect of species, breed and route of virus inoculation on the pathogenicity of H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza (HPAI) viruses in domestic ducks.	Pantin-Jackwood M, Swayne DE, Smith D, Shepherd E	Vet Res	 2013 Jul 22;44:62	 doi: 101186/1297-9716-44-62	H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to be a threat to poultry in many regions of the world. Domestic ducks have been recognized as one of the primary factors in the spread of H5N1 HPAI. In this study we examined the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI viruses in different species and breeds of domestic ducks and the effect of route of virus inoculation on the outcome of infection. We determined that the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI viruses varies between the two common farmed duck species, with Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) presenting more severe disease than various breeds of Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica ducks including Pekin, Mallard-type, Black Runners, Rouen, and Khaki Campbell ducks. We also found that Pekin and Muscovy ducks inoculated with two H5N1 HPAI viruses of different virulence, given by any one of three routes (intranasal, intracloacal, or intraocular), became infected with the viruses. Regardless of the route of inoculation, the outcome of infection was similar for each species but depended on the virulence of the virus used. Muscovy ducks showed more severe clinical signs and higher mortality than the Pekin ducks. In conclusion, domestic ducks are susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus infection by different routes of exposure, but the presentation of the disease varied by virus strain and duck species. This information helps support the planning and implementation of H5N1 HPAI surveillance and control measures in countries with large domestic duck populations.
446	23843036	Multi-scale habitat selection affects offspring survival in a precocial species.	Bloom PM, Clark RG, Howerter DW, Armstrong LM	Oecologia	 2013 Dec;173(4):1249-59	 doi: 101007/s00442-013-2698-4 Epub 2013 Jul 11	In theory, habitat preferences should be adaptive. Accordingly, fitness is often assumed to be greater in preferred habitats; however, this assumption is rarely tested and, when it is, the results are often equivocal. Habitat preferences may not directly convey fitness advantages if animals are constrained by tradeoffs with other selective pressures like predation or food availability. We address unresolved questions about the survival consequences of habitat choices made during brood-rearing in a precocial species with exclusive maternal care (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, n = 582 radio-marked females on 27 sites over 8 years). We directly linked duckling survival with habitat selection patterns at two spatial scales using logistic regression and model selection techniques. At the landscape scale (55-80 km(2)), females that demonstrated stronger selection of areas with more cover type 4 wetlands and greater total cover type 3 wetland area (wetlands with large expanses of open water surrounded by either a narrow or wide peripheral band of vegetation, respectively) had lower duckling survival rates than did females that demonstrated weaker selection of these habitats. At finer scales (0.32-7.16 km(2)), females selected brood-rearing areas with a greater proportion of wetland habitat with no consequences for duckling survival. However, females that avoided woody perennial habitats composed of trees and shrubs fledged more ducklings. The relationship between habitat selection and survival depended on both spatial scale and habitats considered. Females did not consistently select brood-rearing habitats that conferred the greatest benefits, an unexpected finding, although one that has also been reported in other recent studies of breeding birds.
447	23835450	Directional compass preference for landing in water birds.	Hart V, Malkemper EP, Kusta T, Begall S, Novakova P, Hanzal V, Pleskac L, Jezek M, Policht R, Husinec V, Cerveny J, Burda H	Front Zool	 2013 Jul 8;10(1):38	 doi: 101186/1742-9994-10-38	INTRODUCTION: Landing flight in birds is demanding on visual control of velocity, distance to target, and slope of descent. Birds flying in flocks must also keep a common course of landing in order to avoid collisions. Whereas the wind direction may provide a cue for landing, the nature of the landing direction indicator under windless conditions has been unknown. We recorded and analysed landing directions of 3,338 flocks in 14 species of water birds in eight countries. RESULTS: We show that the preferred landing direction, independently of the direction from which the birds have arrived, is along the north-south axis. We analysed the effect of the time of the year, time of the day (and thus sun position), weather (sunny versus overcast), light breeze, locality, latitude, and magnetic declination in 2,431 flocks of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and found no systematic effect of these factors upon the preferred direction of landing. We found that magnetic North was a better predictor for landing direction than geographic North. CONCLUSIONS: In absence of any other common denominator determining the landing direction, the alignment with the magnetic field lines seems to be the most plausible if not the only explanation for the directional landing preference under windless and overcast conditions and we suggest that the magnetic field thus provides a landing direction indicator.
448	23778596	The epizootiology of anatid herpesvirus 1 infection in free-flying waterfowl: a comparison of latent and active infections among native waterfowl, captive-reared released ducks, and peridomestic or feral ducks.	Keel MK, Stallknecht D, Cobb D, Cunningham M, Goekjian V, Gordon-Akhvlediani S, Fischer JR	J Wildl Dis	 2013 Jul;49(3):486-91	 doi: 107589/2012-10-250	The epizootiology of anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) infection in waterfowl is poorly understood but apparently involves persistence of the virus in latently infected birds. Epornitics have often occurred in captive waterfowl or semiwild ducks in parklike settings, and many wildlife professionals conclude that such ducks may be the source of infection for wild waterfowl. We assessed the prevalence of latent infection and viral shedding from four groups of waterfowl: naturally occurring populations of native waterfowl, captive-reared waterfowl released for shooting, introduced nonmigratory waterfowl (e.g., resident, wild Mallards; Anas platyrhynchos), and semiwild peridomestic waterfowl (e.g., park ducks) in North Carolina and Florida, USA from 2004 to 2009. A nested PCR assay was used to detect viral DNA in trigeminal ganglia and cloacal swabs. Detection of viral DNA in trigeminal ganglia, but not cloacal swabs, was assumed to indicate latent infection, whereas PCR-positive cloacal swabs indicated active shedding of the virus. We collected 2,045 samples from 23 species of native, wild waterfowl, and detected latent infections in nine species. Wild Northern Pintails (Anas acuta), a species reportedly resistant to the virus, had the highest prevalence (8.1%). However, low prevalences were identified in other waterfowl from various families. Cloacal shedding was rarely detected (0.1% prevalence) among native waterfowl and was observed in one Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors) and one Mottled Duck (Anas fulvigula). All captive-reared, released waterfowl (n=13) collected were Mallards and one was latently infected, suggesting that these birds could also serve as a source of AHV-1 for naive waterfowl. All nonmigratory waterfowl sampled (n=90) were also Mallards. None of the resident Mallards were shedding virus, but one was latently infected. The peridomestic waterfowl sampled included breeds of domestic Mallard (n=6) and Muscovy Ducks (Cairina moschata; n=73). One peridomestic Mallard and four Muscovy Ducks were shedding virus at the time they were sampled, but no latently infected, asymptomatic carriers were identified.
449	23773971	Assessing effects of environmental chemicals on neuroendocrine systems: potential mechanisms and functional outcomes.	Ottinger MA, Carro T, Bohannon M, Baltos L, Marcell AM, McKernan M, Dean KM, Lavoie E, Abdelnabi M	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2013 Sep 1;190:194-202	 doi: 101016/jygcen201306004 Epub 2013 Jun 15	Environmental pollutants encompass a vast array of compounds. Most studies in birds have focused on toxicological effects, with little attention to non-lethal effects. Consequently, it has proven difficult to assess potential risk associated with exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Assessing potential adverse effects due to exposure is further complicated by the great variation that occurs across avian species. These include variations in reproductive strategies, life span, sexual differentiation, and migration. Differences in reproductive strategies, particularly in the developmental patterns and mechanisms for precocial and altricial chicks, predispose birds to wide variations in response to steroids and steroid-like EDCs. We have investigated the effects of EDCs in precocial birds including Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) as well as in wild altricial songbirds. Studies in Japanese quail characterized endogenous steroid hormone changes during development and have demonstrated that the developing embryo uses the yolk as a 'steroid hormone depot'. It appears that actual embryonic exposure is quantitatively lower than indicated by the treatment in egg injections and that the true amount of compound necessary for bioactivity may be quite low relative to the actual dosage delivered. Additionally, embryonic exposure to specific EDCs adversely affected sexual differentiation in quail, especially impacting male sexual behavior as well as neural systems, immune response, and thyroid hormones. Many of these studies considered single compounds; however, wild birds are exposed to complex mixtures and multiple compounds. We tested complex mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations that bracketed those found in eggs in contaminated regions. Results indicated that the predictive value of the toxic equivalency (TEQ), based on comparative activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) relative to dioxin was not as accurate as expected. We discuss the potential of developing an endocrine disruption index (EDI) to bridge the inconsistencies observed between responses predicted by the TEQ and those observed in vivo following exposure to EDCs. Further, we will discuss how an EDI would complement the adverse outcome pathways analyses to consider the range of effects of endocrine disruptors in birds.

We present the duck genome sequence and perform deep transcriptome analyses to investigate immune-related genes. Our data indicate that the duck possesses a contractive immune gene repertoire, as in chicken and zebra finch, and this repertoire has been shaped through lineage-specific duplications. We identify genes that are responsive to influenza A viruses using the lung transcriptomes of control ducks and ones that were infected with either a highly pathogenic (A/duck/Hubei/49/05) or a weakly pathogenic (A/goose/Hubei/65/05) H5N1 virus. Further, we show how the duck's defense mechanisms against influenza infection have been optimized through the diversification of its beta-defensin and butyrophilin-like repertoires. These analyses, in combination with the genomic and transcriptomic data, provide a resource for characterizing the interaction between host and influenza viruses.

Dao TH, Nguyen TG, Victor B, Gabriel S, Dorny P	J Helminthol	 2014 Dec;88(4):441-6	 doi: 101017/S0022149X13000400 Epub 2013 May 31	Flukes were found in the bile ducts of domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), necropsied in the Binh Dinh province of Central Vietnam. Following staining, morphological characteristics of the bird flukes were compatible with Opisthorchis viverrini, although some characteristics differed from those described in specimens collected from mammal hosts. Computation of the phylogenetic trees on the partial sequences of the second internal ribosomal spacer (ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) markers of the mitochondrial DNA showed close similarity of the 'bird' Opisthorchis sp. with O. viverrini. We speculate that these bird flukes are O. viverrini that show intraspecies morphological and molecular variability compared to isolates from mammals. This demonstrates the complex epidemiological situation of opisthorchiasis in Vietnam and urges investigations on the potential of birds as a reservoir host of this zoonotic fluke.
452	23678723	Infectivity and pathogenicity of Newcastle disease virus strains of different avian origin and different virulence for mallard ducklings.	Dai Y, Liu M, Cheng X, Shen X, Wei Y, Zhou S, Yu S, Ding C	Avian Dis	 2013 Mar;57(1):8-14	 doi: 101637/10298-070212-Reg1	Experimental infections of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains of different avian origin and different virulence in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings were undertaken to evaluate infectivity and pathogenicity of NDV for ducks and the potential role of ducks in the epidemiology of Newcastle disease (ND). Ducklings were experimentally infected with seven NDV strains, and their clinical sign, weight gain, antibody response, virus shedding, and virus distribution in tissues were investigated. The duck origin virulent strain duck/Jiangsu/JSD0812/2008 (JSD0812) and the Chinese standard virulent strain F48E8 were highly pathogenic for ducklings. They caused high morbidity and mortality, and they distributed extensively in various tissues of infected ducklings. Other strains, including pigeon origin virulent strain pigeon/Jiangsu/JSP0204/2002 (JSP0204), chicken origin virulent strain chicken/Jiangsu/JSC0804/2008 (JSC0804), goose origin virulent goose/Jiangsu/JSG0210/2002 (JSG0210), and vaccine strains Mukteswar and LaSota had no pathogenicity to ducklings. They produced neither clinical signs of the disease nor adverse effect on growth of infected ducklings, and they persisted in duck bodies for only a short period. Virus shedding was detectable in all infected ducklings, but its period and route varied with the virulence of NDV strains. The results suggest that NDV with high pathogenicity in ducks may arise from the evolution within its corresponding host, further confirming that the ducks play an important role in the epidemiology of ND.
453	23637797	Individual variation in influenza A virus infection histories and long-term immune responses in Mallards.	Tolf C, Latorre-Margalef N, Wille M, Bengtsson D, Gunnarsson G, Grosbois V, Hasselquist D, Olsen B, Elmberg J, Waldenstrom J	PLoS One	 2013 Apr 23;8(4):e61201	 doi: 101371/journalpone0061201 Print 2013	Wild dabbling ducks (genus Anas) are the main reservoir for influenza A virus (IAV) in the Northern Hemisphere. Current understanding of disease dynamics and epidemiology in this virus-host system has primarily been based on population-level surveillance studies and infection experiments conducted in laboratory settings. Using a combined experimental-natural approach with wild-strain captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), we monitored individual IAV infection histories and immunological responses of 10 birds over the course of 15 months. This is the first detailed study to track natural IAV infection histories over several seasons amongst the same individuals growing from juvenile to adults. The general trends in the infection histories of the monitored birds reflected seasonal variation in prevalence at the population level. However, within the study group there were significant differences between individuals in infection frequency as well as in short and long term anti-IAV antibody response. Further observations included individual variation in the number of infecting virus subtypes, and a strong tendency for long-lasting hemagglutinin-related homosubtypic immunity. Specifically, all infections in the second autumn, except one, were of different subtypes compared to the first autumn. The variation among birds concerning these epidemiologically important traits illustrates the necessity for IAV studies to move from the level of populations to examine individuals in order to further our understanding of IAV disease and epidemiology.
454	23608476	Differences in the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in feather samples from 4-week-old and 24-week-old infected Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica).	Aiello R, Beato MS, Mancin M, Rigoni M, Tejeda AR, Maniero S, Capua I, Terregino C	Vet Microbiol	 2013 Aug 30;165(3-4):443-7	 doi: 101016/jvetmic201303019 Epub 2013 Apr 4	Previous studies have reported the detection of H5N1 HPAI virus in feathers from ducks naturally and experimentally infected and suggested that feather calami (FC) could be used as diagnostic samples for the early detection of H5N1 HPAI infections. Ducks are readily infected with H5N1 HPAI viruses although the development of clinical signs and deaths were reported as age-related with younger birds being more susceptible. The correlation between age and virus localisation in FC of infected ducks has not been studied to date. In the present study juvenile (4-week-old) and adult (24-week-old) Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) were infected experimentally with a clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAI virus (A/duck/Nigeria/1071-23/2007). Tracheal (Tr) and cloacal (Cl) swabs and FC were collected at 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post infection and tested by RRT-PCR and a double antibody sandwich-ELISA (DAS-ELISA) developed in house. Virus was detected in swabs and FC of challenged ducks with a higher rate of detection in juvenile ducks. In this age group virus was detected over a longer period of time in FC compared to swabs. Our study showed that FC samples collected from young ducks are a valid diagnostic specimen for H5N1 HPAI virus detection. The DAS-ELISA on FC proved to be a suitable alternative diagnostic test when molecular and/or virus isolation techniques are not available therefore it could be useful in the diagnosis of H5N1 HPAI infections in under-resourced countries.
455	23603471	Levels of metals in blood samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from urban areas in Poland.	Binkowski LJ, Meissner W	Environ Pollut	 2013 Jul;178:336-42	 doi: 101016/jenvpol201303030 Epub 2013 Apr 18	In this paper we present the studies conducted on blood samples taken from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Birds were captured for ringing purposes (n = 43) in two small and two big towns (including highly urbanized areas). For comparison samples of blood from birds shot on fish ponds were used (n = 26). Based on the body mass all sampled individuals can be assessed as being in good condition. Levels of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) in blood samples were measured with AAS. Concentrations of metals did not differ statistically between sexes and made up a following order: Fe > Zn > Cu > Cr approximately Ni > Pb > Cd. Mallards from towns revealed lower concentrations of Zn and Cu but higher concentration of Fe. There was no difference in exposition to Pb between birds from towns and fish ponds.
456	23598430	Field confirmation of modified pressurized solvent extraction vessels for the analysis of polychlorinated biphenyl congeners in blood samples from Great Lakes Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Haskins SD, Kelly DG, Weir RD	Environ Sci Process Impacts	 2013 Jun;15(6):1172-80	 doi: 101039/c3em00104k	Miniaturized pressurized solvent extraction vessels were used to examine polychlorinated biphenyl congener (PCB) concentrations in 0.2 g sample sizes of whole blood, liver, heart and breast tissue sampled from twelve Great Lakes Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). This study successfully supported the blood extraction method, previously validated only using laboratory prepared blood samples, using field samples. In situ clean-up offered excellent sample throughput without degradation of GC-MS performance; using this method, extraction, instrument analysis and data interpretation for 100 samples could be accomplished within a one to two week time period. Results indicated contamination in the blood ( summation operatorPCB = 1.9-13 ng g(-1) ww), liver ( summation operatorPCB = 0.8-11 ng g(-1) ww), breast ( summation operatorPCB = <0.1-9 ng g(-1) ww) and heart tissue ( summation operatorPCB = <0.1-6 ng g(-1) ww). Quality control included the analysis of blank samples, NIST SRM 1589a and a duplicate of each sample type (blood or tissue). All blank samples were below the method detection limit, SRM values were within 70% of their certified values and duplicates were within 70% of each other. Correlations were examined for the suite of analysed congeners between blood and various tissues; within select individuals a strong and significant correlation was observed. TEQs were calculated and compared against known toxicity data for bird species. Based on the PCB levels found in this study, no adverse health effects are expected in the birds themselves. summation operatorPCB concentrations in the breast tissue were also compared against both the Canadian and American guidelines for the consumption of edible poultry and based on these values, the Mallards used in this research would be safe for human consumption.
457	23575317	Molecular and epidemiological characterization of avian influenza viruses from gulls and dabbling ducks in Norway.	Tonnessen R, Kristoffersen AB, Jonassen CM, Hjortaas MJ, Hansen EF, Rimstad E, Hauge AG	Virol J	 2013 Apr 10;10:112	 doi: 101186/1743-422X-10-112	BACKGROUND: Wild aquatic birds constitute the natural reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIVs). Separate Eurasian and American AIV gene pools exist. Here, the prevalence and diversity of AIVs in gulls and dabbling ducks in Norway were described. The influence of host species and temporal changes on AIV prevalence was examined. Five AIVs from Norway, including three from common gull (Larus canus), were analyzed along with 10 available AIV genomes from gulls in Eurasia to search for evidence of intracontinental and intercontinental reassortment of gene segments encoding the internal viral proteins. METHODS: Swabs collected from 2417 dabbling ducks and gulls in the south-west of Norway during five ordinary hunting seasons (August-December) in the period 2005-2010 were analyzed for presence of AIV. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify associations between AIV prevalence, host species and sampling time. Five AIVs from mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) (H3N8, H9N2) and common gull (H6N8, H13N2, H16N3) were full-length characterized and phylogenetically analyzed together with GenBank reference sequences. RESULTS: Low pathogenic AIVs were detected in 15.5% (CI: 14.1-17.0) of the samples. The overall AIV prevalence was lower in December compared to that found in August to November (p = 0.003). AIV was detected in 18.7% (CI: 16.8-20.6) of the dabbling ducks. A high AIV prevalence of 7.8% (CI; 5.9-10.0) was found in gulls. A similar temporal pattern in AIV prevalence was found in both bird groups. Thirteen hemagglutinin and eight neuraminidase subtypes were detected. No evidence of intercontinental reassortment was found. Eurasian avian (non H13 and H16) PB2 or PA genes were identified in five reference Eurasian gull (H13 and H16) AIV genomes from GenBank. The NA gene from the Norwegian H13N2 gull isolate was of Eurasian avian origin. CONCLUSIONS: The similar temporal pattern in AIV prevalence found in dabbling ducks and gulls, the relatively high virus prevalence detected in gulls and the evidence of intracontinental reassortment in AIVs from gulls indicate that gulls that interact with dabbling ducks are likely to be mixing vessels for AIVs from waterfowl and gulls. Our results support that intercontinental reassortment is rare in AIVs from gulls in Eurasia.
458	23531827	Immune function is related to adult carotenoid and bile pigment levels, but not to dietary carotenoid access during development, in female mallard ducks.	Butler MW, McGraw KJ	J Exp Biol	 2013 Jul 15;216(Pt 14):2632-40	 doi: 101242/jeb082982 Epub 2013 Mar 26	Immune function can be modulated by multiple physiological factors, including nutrition and reproductive state. Because these factors can vary throughout an individual's lifetime as a result of environmental conditions (affecting nutrition) or life-history stage (e.g. entering the adult reproduction stage), we must carefully examine the degree to which developmental versus adult conditions shape performance of the immune system. We investigated how variation in dietary access to carotenoid pigments - a class of molecules with immunostimulatory properties that females deposit into egg yolks - during three different developmental time points affected adult immunological and reproductive traits in female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). In males and females of other avian species, carotenoid access during development affects carotenoid assimilation ability, adult sexual ornamentation and immune function, while carotenoid access during adulthood can increase immune response and reproductive investment (e.g. egg-laying capacity, biliverdin deposition in eggshells). We failed to detect effects of developmental carotenoid supplementation on adult immune function [phytohemagglutinin-induced cutaneous immune response, antibody production in response to the novel antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), or oxidative burst, assessed by changes in circulating nitric oxide levels], carotenoid-pigmented beak coloration, ovarian development, circulating carotenoid levels or concentration of bile pigments in the gall bladder. However, we did uncover positive relationships between circulating carotenoid levels during adulthood and KLH-specific antibody production, and a negative relationship between biliverdin concentration in bile and KLH-specific antibody production. These results are consistent with the view that adult physiological parameters better predict current immune function than do developmental conditions, and highlight a possible, previously unstudied relationship between biliverdin and immune system performance.
459	23528974	A novel SNP marker of ovalbumin gene in association with duck hatchability.	Huang HL, Huang LT, Cheng YS	Theriogenology	 2013 May;79(8):1218-1223	e1 doi: 101016/jtheriogenology201302021 Epub 2013 Mar 23	Our previous transcriptome analysis using a cDNA microarray identified differentially-expressed transcripts in Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos); we concluded that the ovalbumin gene might be involved in duck hatchability. In the present study, associations of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of the duck ovalbumin gene with hatchability were investigated. To confirm the cDNA microarray analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis were used to validate ovalbumin gene expression. The messenger RNA and protein expression of the ovalbumin gene were higher (P < 0.05) in the low-hatchability group (1.00 +/- 0.19; 30.36 +/- 3.51 arbitrary units) than in high-hatchability counterparts (0.56 +/- 0.07; 8.53 +/- 2.97 arbitrary units), consistent with the previous cDNA microarray analysis. The PCR products (506 base pairs) of ovalbumin gene amplified by the primer pair of TovaF and TovaR from the genomic DNA templates of 10 ducks were sequenced and a g.385 C>T SNP site in the 506-base pair sequence of the ovalbumin gene identified. Genotyping of SNP of 187 ducks was then carried out by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism and minisequencing methods. Based on SNP genotypes of the duck ovalbumin gene, there were three types: CC, TT, and CT. Birds with the CC and TT genotypes had higher hatchability (79.59 +/- 3.40, 76.35 +/- 1.77) (P < 0.05) than those with a CT genotype (65.77 +/- 2.07). In conclusion, the ovalbumin gene was an important candidate gene that can be used for marker-assisted selection to increase hatchability in Tsaiya ducks.
460	23500832	Histopathology of liver and kidneys of wild living Mallards Anas platyrhynchos and Coots Fulica atra with considerable concentrations of lead and cadmium.	Binkowski LJ, Sawicka-Kapusta K, Szarek J, Strzyzewska E, Felsmann M	Sci Total Environ	 2013 Apr 15;450-451:326-33	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv201302002	Concentrations of cadmium and lead were measured in liver and kidneys of Mallard (n=60) and Coot (n=50). Free living birds were collected by hunters in years 2006-2008 in the area of fishponds near Zator in southern Poland. Age group was determined according to the appearance of the plumage (Mallards) and iris color (Coot). Concentrations of metals were measured with ET-AA spectrometer. Among all birds specimens with negligible (n=5) and high concentrations (Mallards n=18 and Coots n=17) of cadmium and lead were chosen for further analysis. Histopathological alterations were observed, ranging from circulatory disturbances, retrogressive changes, inflammations to leukocytic infiltration in liver and kidney. They dominated among birds with the highest concentrations of metals. The control group of birds was characterized by a very small number of mentioned lesions. Probably the higher cadmium and lead concentrations in tissues are co-factors in the development of lesions.
461	23459475	Effect of oseltamivir carboxylate consumption on emergence of drug-resistant H5N2 avian influenza virus in Mallard ducks.	Achenbach JE, Bowen RA	Antimicrob Agents Chemother	 2013 May;57(5):2171-81	 doi: 101128/AAC02126-12 Epub 2013 Mar 4	Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) has been detected in environmental waters at various levels during recent influenza seasons in humans, reflecting levels of usage and stability of this drug. In consideration of the role of waterfowl as hosts for influenza viruses that may contribute to human infections, we evaluated the effect of consumption of low doses of OC on development of oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus mutants in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with two different low-pathogenic (LP) H5N2 avian influenza viruses (AIV). We detected development of virus variants carrying a known molecular marker of oseltamivir resistance (neuraminidase E119V) in 4 out of 6 mallards infected with A/Mallard/Minnesota/182742/1998 (H5N2) and exposed to 1,000 ng/liter OC. The mutation first appeared as a minor population on days 5 to 6 and was the dominant genotype on days 6 to 8. Oseltamivir-resistant mutations were not detected in virus from ducks not exposed to the drug or in ducks infected with a second strain of virus and similarly exposed to OC. Virus isolates carrying the E119V mutation displayed in vitro replication kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, but in vivo, the E119V virus rapidly reverted back to wild type in the absence of OC, and only the wild-type parental strain was transmitted to contact ducks. These results indicate that consumption by wild waterfowl of OC in drinking water may promote selection of the E119V resistance mutation in some strains of H5N2 AIV that could contribute to viruses infecting human populations.
462	23402132	Avian influenza and animal health risk: conservation of endemic threatened wild birds in Sardinia Island.	Delogu M, Piredda I, Pintore A, Cabras P, Cotti C, Ghetti G, Raffini E, De Marco MA	Avian Dis	 2012 Dec;56(4 Suppl):1034-9	 doi: 101637/10174-041012-ResNote1	Sardinia is a Mediterranean island with a long geological history, leading to a separation process from continental Europe during the Miocene. As a consequence, in this insular habitat some wild bird species developed endemic forms, some of which are currently threatened. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible animal health risk associated with a potential avian influenza virus (AIV) circulation in Sardinian wild bird populations. Overall, 147 cloacal swabs were sampled in the Sardinia region from June 2009 to September 2011. Samples were obtained from 12 taxonomic orders, including 16 families and 40 species of birds. Based on the endangered host status or on the ecology of the host-virus interaction, samples were categorized into three groups of species: 1) endemic, endangered, or both (17 species); 2) potential reservoir (21 species); and 3) potential spillover (two species). Cloacal swabs were tested by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for influenza A virus matrix gene amplification. Forty-one serum samples were tested by nucleoprotein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NP-ELISA) for antibodies against influenza A virus nucleoprotein and by hemagglutination inhibition assay for detection of seropositivity against H5 and H7 AIV subtypes. No cloacal swabs tested RT-PCR positive for AIV, whereas two weak seropositive results were detected by NP-ELISA in a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and in a yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). The low or absent AIV circulation detected in Sardinia's wild birds during the study suggests a naive status in these avian populations. These data provide new information on AIV circulation in Sardinia's wild birds that could be applied to implement conservation strategies for threatened species.
463	23402123	Effect of different routes of inoculation on infectivity and viral shedding of LPAI viruses in mallards.	Franca M, Poulson R, Brown J, Howerth EW, Berghaus RD, Carter D, StallknechtD E	Avian Dis	 2012 Dec;56(4 Suppl):981-5	 doi: 101637/10151-040812-ResNote1	We studied the effect of different routes of inoculation on the infectivity and duration of viral shedding in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with wild bird-origin low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs). One-month-old mallards were inoculated with 10(6) median embryo infectious doses of either A/mallard/MN/199106/99 (H3N8) or A/mallard/MN/355779/00 (H5N2) via 1 of 5 different routes: intranasal (IN), intratracheal (IT), intraocular (IO), intracloacal (IC), or intra-ingluvial (II). Birds in all routes of inoculation groups became infected with LPAIV as detected by virus isolation, real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and serology. Mallards in different route of inoculation groups had similar viral shedding through oropharynx and cloaca from 1 day postinoculation (dpi). The peak of oropharyngeal (OP) viral shedding was reached between 2 and 3 dpi in all routes of inoculation groups infected with either virus. The peak of cloacal (CL) viral excretion was reached between 2 and 3 dpi in all routes of inoculation groups infected with H3N8 LPAIV and in the IO-, IC-, and II-inoculated groups infected with H5N2 LPAIV, with a delayed and shorter peak for the IN- and IT-inoculated groups. The birds inoculated via the II route had more productive OP and CL viral shedding after infection with either LPAIV, as evidenced by higher number of swabs testing positive over the study period. In conclusion, mallards can be infected with LPAIV by various routes of inoculation, and this corroborates their high susceptibility to infection by these viruses.
464	23402121	Susceptibility of avian species to North American H13 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses.	Brown J, Poulson R, Carter D, Lebarbenchon C, Pantin-Jackwood M, Spackman E, Shepherd E, Killian M, Stallknecht D	Avian Dis	 2012 Dec;56(4 Suppl):969-75	 doi: 101637/10158-040912-Reg1	Gulls are widely recognized reservoirs for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses; however, the subtypes maintained in these populations and/or the transmission mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Although, a wide diversity of influenza viruses have been isolated from gulls, two hemagglutinin subtypes (H13 and H16) are rarely detected in other avian groups, and existing surveillance data suggests they are maintained almost exclusively within gull populations. In order to evaluate the host range of these gull-adapted influenza subtypes and to characterize viral infection in the gull host, we conducted a series of challenge experiments, with multiple North American strains of H13 LPAI virus in ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), chickens (Gallus domesticus), and turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). The susceptibility to H13 LPAI viruses varied between species and viral strain. Gulls were highly susceptible to H13 LPAI virus infection and excreted virus via the oropharynx and cloaca for several days. The quantity and duration of shedding was similar between the two routes. Turkeys and ducks were resistant to infection with most strains of H13 LPAI virus, but low numbers of inoculated birds were infected after challenge with specific viral strains. Chickens were refractory to infection with all strains of H13 LPAI virus they were challenged with. The experimental results presented herein are consistent with existing surveillance data on H13 LPAI viruses in birds, and indicate that influenza viruses of the H13 subtype are strongly host-adapted to gulls, but rare spill-over into aberrant hosts (i.e., turkeys and ducks) can occur.
465	23402116	Immune responses and protection against H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus induced by the Newcastle disease virus H5 vaccine in ducks.	Ferreira HL, Pirlot JF, Reynard F, van den Berg T, Bublot M, Lambrecht B	Avian Dis	 2012 Dec;56(4 Suppl):940-8	 doi: 101637/10148-040812-ResNote1	Ducks play an important role in the epidemiology of avian influenza, and there is a need for new avian influenza vaccines that are suitable for mass vaccination in ducks. The immune responses as well as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 protection induced by a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector expressing an H5N1 hemagglutinin (rNDV-H5) were investigated in mule ducks, a hybrid between Muscovy (Cairina moschata domesticus) males and Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) females. Immunological tools to measure NDV and H5-specific serum antibody, mucosal, and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses in ducks have been validated after infection with the vector NDV and an H5N1 low pathogenic avian influenza virus. The effect of maternally-derived antibodies (MDAs) to NDV on the humoral and CMI responses after NDV-H5 vaccination was also investigated. Our results showed the rNDV-H5 vaccine elicits satisfactory humoral and cellular responses in 11-day-old ducks correlating with a complete clinical and virological protection against the H5N1 strain. However, vaccination with rNDV-H5 in the presence of NDV MDA induced lower NDV-specific serum antibody, mucosal, and CMI responses than in ducks with no MDA, while interestingly the H5-specific serum antibody and duodenal IgY response were higher in ducks with NDV MDA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of an NDV vector in ducks and of an HPAI H5N1 challenge in mule ducks, which appeared to be as resistant as Pekin ducks.
466	23398968	The impact of viral tropism and housing conditions on the transmission of three H5/H7 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in chickens.	Claes G, Welby S, Van Den Berg T, Van Der Stede Y, Dewulf J, Lambrecht B, Marche S	Epidemiol Infect	 2013 Nov;141(11):2428-43	 doi: 101017/S0950268813000125 Epub 2013 Feb 11	In this study, shedding and transmission of three H5/H7 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) in poultry was characterized and the impact of floor system on transmission was assessed. Transmission experiments were simultaneously conducted with two groups of animals housed on either a grid or a floor covered with litter. Transmission was observed for H5N2 A/Ch/Belgium/150VB/99 LPAIV. This virus was shed almost exclusively via the oropharynx and no impact of floor system was seen. Transmission was also seen for H7N1 A/Ch/Italy/1067/v99 LPAIV, which was shed via both the oropharynx and cloaca. A slight increase in transmission was seen for animals housed on litter. H5N3 A/Anas Platyrhynchos/Belgium/09-884/2008 LPAIV did not spread to susceptible animals, regardless of the floor system. This study shows that environmental factors such as floor systems used in poultry barns may act upon the transmission of LPAIVs. However, the level of influence depends on the virus under consideration and, more specifically, its principal replication sites.
467	23397847	Chlamydia psittaci in Swedish wetland birds: a risk to zoonotic infection-	Blomqvist M, Christerson L, Waldenstrom J, Herrmann B, Olsen B	Avian Dis	 2012 Dec;56(4):737-40	 doi: 101637/10105-022812-ResNote1	Chlamydia psittaci in birds may be transmitted to humans and cause respiratory infections, sometimes as severe disease. Our study investigated the C. psittaci prevalence in migratory birds in Sweden by real-time PCR. Fecal specimens or cloacal swabs were collected from 497 birds from 22 different species, mainly mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), at two bird observatories in Sweden. DNA from C psittaci was found in six (1.2%) birds from three different species. Five of the positive specimens were infected with four novel strains of C. psittaci, based on sequencing of partial 16S rRNA gene and ompA gene, and the sixth was indentified as a recently described Chlamydiaceae-like bacterium. Considering exposure to humans it is concluded that the risk of zoonotic infection is low.
468	23397842	Inflammatory markers following acute fuel oil exposure or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lee KA, Tell LA, Mohr FC	Avian Dis	 2012 Dec;56(4):704-10	 doi: 101637/10075-020712-Reg1	Adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were orally dosed with bunker C fuel oil for 5 days, and five different inflammatory markers (haptoglobin, mannan-binding lectin, ceruloplasmin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, and plasma iron) were measured in blood plasma prior to and 8, 24, 48, and 72 hr following exposure. In order to contrast the response to fuel oil with that of a systemic inflammatory response, an additional five ducks were injected intramuscularly with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Oil-treated birds had an inflammatory marker profile that was significantly different from control and LPS-treated birds, showing decreases in mannan-binding lectin-dependent hemolysis and unsaturated iron-binding capacity, but no changes in any of the other inflammatory markers. Birds treated with oil also exhibited increased liver weights, decreased body and splenic weights, and decreased packed cell volume.
469	23354058	Distribution and sequence of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone and its potential role as a molecular link between feeding and reproductive systems in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Fraley GS, Coombs E, Gerometta E, Colton S, Sharp PJ, Li Q, Clarke IJ	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2013 Apr 1;184:103-10	 doi: 101016/jygcen201211026 Epub 2013 Jan 25	The reproductive status of adult Pekin drakes is very sensitive to nutritional status. Thus, the purpose of this study was to increase our understanding of the neurobiology underlying the depressive effect of fasting on the secretion of reproductive hormones. It was hypothesized that this effect was mediated by gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH). Networks of GnIH fibers were present throughout the diencephalon, and cell bodies were present primarily, in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The duck GnIH gene was cloned and sequenced and found to encode GnIH and two GnIH-related peptides (GnIH-RP1, GnIH-RP2) which have a similar identity to those found in other avian species. Intracerebroventricular injection of GnIH, but not of GnIH-RP1, depressed plasma LH and stimulated feeding. Fasting for 48h depressed plasma LH and induced fos expression in about half the population of GnIH-ir neurons. These data suggest that GnIH neurons are mediators between feeding and reproductive systems in Pekin drakes.
470	23344844	Mercury in the body of the most commonly occurring European game duck, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L. 1758), from northwestern Poland.	Kalisinska E, Kosik-Bogacka DI, Lisowski P, Lanocha N, Jackowski A	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2013 May;64(4):583-93	 doi: 101007/s00244-012-9860-6 Epub 2013 Jan 24	The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of mercury (Hg) in liver (L), kidney (K), breast muscle [BM (musculus pectoralis major)], breast feathers (BF), and stomach contents (SC) of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L. 1758). Among the edible parts of mallard, the greatest concentrations of Hg were observed in K and L, although they did not exceed 1.5 mg/kg dry weight (dw). Average concentrations in K, L, and BM were 0.27, 0.25, and 0.13 mg/kg dw, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between Hg concentrations in BM and K and in BM and L (r s = 0.92) as well as between Hg concentrations in these tissues and BF. In addition, we found significant correlations between Hg concentrations in SC and BM (r s = 0.72) and in L and K (r s = 0.55). In conclusion, mallard exhibits a measurable response to environmental Hg pollution and meets the requirements of a bioindicator.
471	23342979	Molecular decay of enamel matrix protein genes in turtles and other edentulous amniotes.	Meredith RW, Gatesy J, Springer MS	BMC Evol Biol	 2013 Jan 23;13:20	 doi: 101186/1471-2148-13-20	BACKGROUND: Secondary edentulism (toothlessness) has evolved on multiple occasions in amniotes including several mammalian lineages (pangolins, anteaters, baleen whales), birds, and turtles. All edentulous amniote clades have evolved from ancestors with enamel-capped teeth. Previous studies have documented the molecular decay of tooth-specific genes in edentulous mammals, all of which lost their teeth in the Cenozoic, and birds, which lost their teeth in the Cretaceous. By contrast with mammals and birds, tooth loss in turtles occurred in the Jurassic (201.6-145.5 Ma), providing an extended time window for tooth gene degradation in this clade. The release of the painted turtle and Chinese softshell turtle genomes provides an opportunity to recover the decayed remains of tooth-specific genes in Testudines. RESULTS: We queried available genomes of Testudines (Chrysemys picta [painted turtle], Pelodiscus sinensis [Chinese softshell turtle]), Aves (Anas platyrhynchos [duck], Gallus gallus [chicken], Meleagris gallopavo [turkey], Melopsittacus undulatus [budgerigar], Taeniopygia guttata [zebra finch]), and enamelless mammals (Orycteropus afer [aardvark], Choloepus hoffmanni [Hoffmann's two-toed sloth], Dasypus novemcinctus [nine-banded armadillo]) for remnants of three enamel matrix protein (EMP) genes with putative enamel-specific functions. Remnants of the AMBN and ENAM genes were recovered in Chrysemys and retain their original synteny. Remnants of AMEL were recovered in both testudines, although there are no shared frameshifts. We also show that there are inactivated copies of AMBN, AMEL and ENAM in representatives of divergent avian lineages including Galloanserae, Passeriformes, and Psittaciformes, and that there are shared frameshift mutations in all three genes that predate the basal split in Neognathae. Among enamelless mammals, all three EMP genes exhibit inactivating mutations in Orycteropus and Choloepus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the power of combining fossil and genomic evidence to decipher macroevolutionary transitions and characterize the functional range of different loci involved in tooth development. The fossil record and phylogenetics combine to predict the occurrence of molecular fossils of tooth-specific genes in the genomes of edentulous amniotes, and in every case these molecular fossils have been discovered. The widespread occurrence of EMP pseudogenes in turtles, birds, and edentulous/enamelless mammals also provides compelling evidence that in amniotes, the only unique, non-redundant function of these genes is in enamel formation.
472	23307386	Infectivity of avian influenza virus-positive field samples for mallards: what do our diagnostic results mean-	Brown JD, Poulson R, Carter DL, Lebarbenchon C, Stallknecht DE	J Wildl Dis	 2013 Jan;49(1):180-5	 doi: 107589/2011-11-322	Most surveillance programs for avian influenza (AI) virus in wild birds utilize molecular tests such as real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RRT-PCR) or virus isolation (VI) in embryonating chicken eggs. To provide insight into the relationship between positive diagnostic test results and infectivity for an avian host, we challenged Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with Mallard-derived cloacal swab field samples found positive by VI or RRT-PCR. Six of 11 samples that were both RRT-PCR positive and VI positive infected Mallards. Sample infectivity for Mallards appeared to be dependent on concentration of infectious virus in the sample; five of the six samples that replicated in Mallards had a measurable virus titer, whereas four of the five samples that did not infect Mallards had titers below the limit of detection (10(0.9) median embryo infectious dose/0.2 mL). None of seven samples that were RRT-PCR positive and VI negative infected Mallards. These results indicate that embryonating chicken eggs are a sensitive diagnostic tool for detecting Mallards excreting infectious AI virus at a high enough concentration to infect another Mallard; however, not all cloacal swab field samples that are positive by VI or RRT-PCR are infective to another Mallard. Additionally, our results indicate that Mallards are susceptible to Mallard-origin AI viruses that have not been propagated in embryonating chicken eggs and that some of these virus strains can infect birds at titers that are lower than those typically used in experimental challenge studies. These data highlight a need to examine the effects of using egg-propagated AI viruses in experimental trials.
473	23307376	Pathobiology and virus shedding of low-pathogenic avian influenza virus (A/H1N1) infection in mallards exposed to oseltamivir.	Brojer C, Jarhult JD, Muradrasoli S, Soderstrom H, Olsen B, Gavier-Widen D	J Wildl Dis	 2013 Jan;49(1):103-13	 doi: 107589/2011-11-335	Low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses in wild birds are important as they can constitute the basis for the development of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses or form part of human-adapted strains with pandemic potential. However, the pathogenesis of LPAI viruses is not well characterized in dabbling ducks, one of the natural reservoirs of LPAI viruses. Between 21 September 2009 and 21 December 2009, we used real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), histopathology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to study Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with an influenza A/H1N1 virus isolated from a wild Mallard in Sweden. The ducks were either inoculated intraesophageally ("artificial infection") or infected by virus shed by other ducks in the experiment ("contact infection"). The ducks were subjected to three low concentrations (80 ng/L, 1 mug/L, and 80 mug/L) of the active metabolite of oseltamivir (Tamiflu((R))), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), which resulted in the development of the viral resistance mutation H274Y at 1 and 80 mug/L. The LPAI virus infection was localized to the intestinal tract and cloacal bursa except in one Mallard. The exception was a duck euthanized 1 day postinoculation, whose infection was located solely in the lung, possibly due to intratracheal deposition of virus. The intestinal infection was characterized by occasional degenerating cells in the lamina propria and presence of viral antigen as detected by IHC, as well as positive q-PCR performed on samples from feces and intestinal contents. Histopathologic changes, IHC positivity, and viral shedding all indicated that the infection peaked early, around 2 days postinfection. Furthermore, more viral antigen and viral RNA were detected with IHC and q-PCR in the proximal parts early in the infection. There was no obvious difference in the course of the infection in artificial versus contact infection, when the level of OC was increased from 80 ng/L to 1 mug/L (based on IHC and q-PCR), when the level of OC was increased to 80 mug/L, or when the resistance mutation H274Y developed (based on q-PCR).
474	23243235	Tissue distribution, expression, and antimicrobial activity of Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 6.	Peng KS, Ruan LS, Tu J, Qi KZ, Jiang LH	Poult Sci	 2013 Jan;92(1):97-104	 doi: 103382/ps2012-02562	In this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (AvBD) was isolated from the Chaohu duck. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained a 204-bp open reading frame that encoded 67 amino acids (aa), including a signal peptide of 20 aa, a propiece of 5 aa, and a mature peptide of 42 aa. The homology, characterization, and comparison of this gene with AvBD from other avian species confirmed that it was duck AvBD6. Also, the preproprotein of AvBD6 from chicken, goose, and duck was highly conserved with 100% aa homology. The AvBD6 mRNA was widely expressed in the investigated tissues of healthy 5-mo-old ducks, with the exception of the skin, kidney, and bursa. The AvBD6 mRNA was highly expressed in the spleen, lung, stomach, tongue, and egg yolk, successively; moderately expressed in the bone marrow and liver; and expressed to lower degrees in the trachea, heart, intestine, muscle, esophagus, and testis. We produced recombinant AvBD6 by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli. The yield of soluble glutathione S-transferees (GST)-AvBD6 in the inclusion bodies increased significantly as the incubation temperature was decreased from 37 to 30 degrees C. As expected, the GST-AvBD6 exhibited strong bactericidal properties [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.5 to 2 muM] against the Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria strain BJCP-5, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis [ATCC 29212); it possessed medium bactericidal properties (MIC = 4 to 8 muM) against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Bacillus subtilis (CMCC 63501;; and it possessed low bactericidal properties (MIC = 16 muM) against Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of GST-AvBD6 proved to be the same as that of synthetic AvBD6. The A. veronii biovar sobria strain BJCP-5 cells that were treated with GST-AvBD6 showed lysis and shrinkage under scanning electron microscopy. The mechanisms of AvBD6-mediated killing of A. veronii biovar sobria involved both cell lysis and nonlysis. Our results indicate that AvBD6 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the Chaohu duck.
475	23242805	Replication of 2 subtypes of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus of duck and gull origins in experimentally infected Mallard ducks.	Daoust PY, van de Bildt M, van Riel D, van Amerongen G, Bestebroer T, Vanderstichel R, Fouchier RA, Kuiken T	Vet Pathol	 2013 May;50(3):548-59	 doi: 101177/0300985812469633 Epub 2012 Dec 14	Many subtypes of low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus circulate in wild bird reservoirs, but their prevalence may vary among species. We aimed to compare by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, virus isolation, histology, and immunohistochemistry the distribution and pathogenicity of 2 such subtypes of markedly different origins in Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos): H2N3 isolated from a Mallard duck and H13N6 isolated from a Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis). Following intratracheal and intraesophageal inoculation, neither virus caused detectable clinical signs, although H2N3 virus infection was associated with a significantly decreased body weight gain during the period of virus shedding. Both viruses replicated in the lungs and air sacs until approximately day 3 after inoculation and were associated with a locally extensive interstitial, exudative, and proliferative pneumonia. Subtype H2N3, but not subtype H13N6, went on to infect the epithelia of the intestinal mucosa and cloacal bursa, where it replicated without causing lesions until approximately day 5 after inoculation. Larger quantities of subtype H2N3 virus were detected in cloacal swabs than in pharyngeal swabs. The possible clinical significance of LPAI virus-associated pulmonary lesions and intestinal tract infection in ducks deserves further evaluation.
476	23237368	Circulation and phylogenetic relationship of chicken and turkey-origin astroviruses detected in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Bidin M, Bidin Z, Majnaric D, Tisljar M, Lojkic I	Avian Pathol	 2012 Dec;41(6):555-62	 doi: 101080/030794572012733340	The natural occurrence of chicken and turkey-origin astroviruses in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) is described. Twenty-two duck flocks were covered by this research. The liver, spleen, kidney and intestines were sampled and tested by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for the presence of avian nephritis virus (ANV), chicken astrovirus (CAstV), turkey astrovirus (TAstV)-1, TAstV-2 and duck astrovirus. The astrovirus infection was confirmed in multiple organ samples from 59.1% of tested flocks. CAstV was detected in one flock, TAstV-2 in three flocks and ANV in 10 flocks. The molecular and phylogenetic analysis of the small open reading frame (ORF) 1b fragment (130 nucleotides) of all chicken and turkey-origin astroviruses detected in ducks showed that ANV-sequence group was more distant from CastV, TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 sequences, which formed a separate, more related group. ANV sequences were divided into three subgroups, suggesting that several types of ANV were circulating in Croatian duck flocks. The comparison of the partial ORF 1b (254 nucleotides) duck ANV sequences with 21 ANVs detected in various avian species (chickens, turkeys, geese, guinea fowl and pigeons) revealed they shared the higher nucleotide (95.6 to 97.2%) and amino acid (98.8 to 100%) identity with two ANV-2-like sequences from chickens (GA-SEP-A451-05 and GA-CK-SEP ANV-364-2005). Phylogenetic neighbour-joining tree analysis based on the same nucleotide alignment, and performed using the Jukes-Cantor method, clustered the compared sequences into three groups. All analysed duck ANV sequences showed a close phylogenetic relationship with chicken-origin ANVs. Additional work is required to determine the significance and pathogenicity of chicken and turkey-origin astroviruses in domestic ducks.
477	23237367	Tissue tropism and pathology of natural influenza virus infection in black-headed gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus).	Hofle U, Van de Bildt MW, Leijten LM, Van Amerongen G, Verhagen JH, Fouchier RA, Osterhaus AD, Kuiken T	Avian Pathol	 2012 Dec;41(6):547-53	 doi: 101080/030794572012744447	Black-headed gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) are a suitable host species to study the epidemiology of low-pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection in wild waterbirds because they are a common colony-breeding species in which LPAIV infection is detected frequently, limited mainly to the H13 and H16 subtypes. However, the sites of virus replication and associated lesions are poorly understood. We therefore performed virological and pathological analyses on tissues of black-headed gulls naturally infected with LPAIV. We found that 24 of 111 black-headed gulls collected from breeding colonies were infected with LPAIV (10 birds with H16N3, one bird with H13N8, 13 birds undetermined), based on virus and viral genome detection in pharyngeal and cloacal swabs. Of these 24 gulls, 15 expressed virus antigen in their tissues. Virus antigen expression was limited to epithelial cells of intestine and cloacal bursa. No histological lesions were detected in association with virus antigen expression. Our findings show that LPAIV replication in the intestinal tract of black-headed gulls is mainly a superficial infection in absence of detectable lesions, as determined recently for natural LPAIV infection in free-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). These findings imply that LPAIV in black-headed gulls has adapted to minimal pathogenicity to its host and that potentially the primary transmission route is faecal-oral.
478	23224277	The cloning, characterization, and expression profiling of the LRP8 gene in duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Hu S, Liu H, Pan Z, Ding F, Kou J, Li L, Wang J	Mol Cell Biochem	 2013 Mar;375(1-2):139-49	 doi: 101007/s11010-012-1536-z Epub 2012 Dec 7	Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family that functions in body lipoprotein homeostasis. In this study, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and real-time PCR were performed to characterize the duck LRP8 gene. The cDNA of duck LRP8 contained a 14-bp 5' UTR, a 2754-bp open reading frame, and a 189-bp 3' UTR. The duck LRP8 encoded a protein of 917 amino acid residues composed of five functional domains and resembling other members of the LDLR family, and it displayed high nucleotide and amino acid homology to the LRP8 sequences in other avian species. The mRNA expression level of LRP8 was greater in duck extra-hepatic adipose tissue than in the liver. The peak expression values of LRP8 in both liver and adipose tissues occurred at week 1 and were significantly higher than the values observed during any other week (p < 0.05). Differences in the expression patterns of LRP8 mRNA from weeks 2 to 8 of growth were observed in different organs. A consistent low expression was observed in the liver, and fluctuating expression was observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (up- and then down-regulated) and abdominal adipose tissue (down-, then up-, then down-regulated). These findings suggest that LRP8 might play more important roles in regulating lipid metabolism in extra-hepatic adipose tissues than in the liver during early growth after hatching in the duck.
479	23214376	Computed tomographic and densitometric analysis of tibiotarsal bone mineral density and content in postnatal Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) as influenced by age and sex.	Charuta A, Cooper RG	Pol J Vet Sci	 2012;15(3):537-45	 doi: 102478/v10181-012-0083-6	The bone mineral density BMD and content BMC were analysed in the tibiotarsal bones of ducks in the postnatal development as influenced by age and sex. One hundred birds from the nesting till the slaughtering maturity were included in the experiment. The analysis was conducted using a densitometer, Norland - Excell Plus and pQCT computed tomography, XCT Research SA Plus. The statistical analysis was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (age) and the U-Mann -Withney test (sex). All calculations were performed in Statistica 9.0 (StatSoft, Inc. Tulsa, USA), at P < or = 0.05. Two-factor analysis of variance ANOVA was applied and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated. The densitometer research showed that BMD and BMC increased in the postnatal development for both sexes. The volumetric bone mineral density vBMD analysis using computed tomography showed that volumetric bone mineral density vBMD of the middle of the diaphyses in situ gradually attenuated during the postnatal development both in males and females, i.e. from 620 mg/cm3 (2 wk) to 500 mg/cm3 (8 wk). The biggest vBMD loss was observed in the diaphyses of females in 4 and 6 wk (r = -0.63 and r = -0.79; P > or = 0.05). The BMC decrease was observed in the proximal metaphyses between 4 and 6 wk for both sexes, r = -0.52 (males), r = -0.53 (females); P < or = 0.05. The gradual loss may be the cause of deformities and fractures of the tibiotarsal bones observed from 4 wk in particular bone sections of both sexes. The achieved results may constitute a helpful source of information for water poultry breeders to prevent limb diseases.
480	23212020	Bioserotypes and virulence markers of Yersinia enterocolitica strains isolated from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus).	Bancerz-Kisiel A, Szczerba-Turek A, Lipczynska K, Stenzel T, Szweda W	J Food Prot	 2012 Dec;75(12):2219-22	 doi: 104315/0362-028XJFP-12-214	Yersinia enterocolitica is the causative agent of yersiniosis in different animal species and in humans. Food contaminated with Y. enterocolitica is the main source of infection for humans, and swine plays a major role in the transmission of the disease. There are a limited number of reports of the prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in wild animals and birds. This study characterized virulence markers associated with Y. enterocolitica isolates recovered from mallards and pheasants. Y. enterocolitica strains were isolated from 5 (11.11%) of 45 mallards originating from a cold culture (peptone, sorbitol, and bile salts medium) belonging to biotype 1A. Serotyping showed that three of these five serotypes represented serotype O:8, one belonged to serotype O:5, and one did not agglutinate with any of the sera and was classified as nonidentified. Molecular analysis for virulence markers detected the ystB gene, which encodes an enterotoxin, in five isolates. Y. enterocolitica was not detected in any of the 16 examined pheasants.
481	23148259	Detection of QTL controlling metabolism, meat quality, and liver quality traits of the overfed interspecific hybrid mule duck.	Kileh-Wais M, Elsen JM, Vignal A, Feves K, Vignoles F, Fernandez X, Manse H, Davail S, Andre JM, Bastianelli D, Bonnal L, Filangi O, Baeza E, Guemene D, Genet C, Bernadet MD, Dubos F, Marie-Etancelin C	J Anim Sci	 2013 Feb;91(2):588-604	 doi: 102527/jas2012-5411 Epub 2012 Nov 12	The mule duck, an interspecific hybrid obtained by crossing common duck (Anas platyrhynchos) females with Muscovy (Cairina moschata) drakes, is widely used for fatty liver production. The purpose of the present study was to detect and map single and pleiotropic QTL that segregate in the common duck species, and influence the expression of traits in their overfed mule duck offspring. To this end, we generated a common duck backcross (BC) population by crossing Kaiya and heavy Pekin experimental lines, which differ notably in regard to the BW and overfeeding ability of their mule progeny. The BC females were mated to Muscovy drakes and, on average, 4 male mule ducks hatched per BC female (1600 in total) and were measured for growth, metabolism during growth and the overfeeding period, overfeeding ability, and the quality of their breast meat and fatty liver. The phenotypic value of BC females was estimated for each trait by assigning to each female the mean value of the phenotypes of her offspring. Estimations allowed for variance, which depended on the number of male offspring per BC and the heritability of the trait considered. The genetic map used for QTL detection consisted of 91 microsatellite markers aggregated into 16 linkage groups (LG) covering a total of 778 cM. Twenty-two QTL were found to be significant at the 1% chromosome-wide threshold level using the single-trait detection option of the QTLMap software. Most of the QTL detected were related to the quality of breast meat and fatty liver: QTL for meat pH 20 min post mortem were mapped to LG4 (at the 1% genome-wide significance level), and QTL for meat lipid content and cooking losses were mapped to LG2a. The QTL related to fatty liver weight and liver protein and lipid content were for the most part detected on LG2c and LG9. Multitrait analysis highlighted the pleiotropic effects of QTL in these chromosome regions. Apart from the strong QTL for plasma triglyceride content at the end of the overfeeding period mapped to chromosome Z using single-trait analysis, all metabolic trait QTL were detected with the multitrait approach: the QTL mapped to LG14 and LG21 affected the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride contents, whereas the QTL mapped to LG2a seemed to impact glycemia and the basal plasma corticosterone content. A greater density genetic map will be needed to further fine map the QTL.
482	23145510	Toxoplasma gondii in waterfowl: the first detection of this parasite in Anas crecca and Anas clypeata from Italy.	Mancianti F, Nardoni S, Mugnaini L, Poli A	J Parasitol	 2013 Jun;99(3):561-3	 doi: 101645/12-341 Epub 2012 Nov 12	Understanding the spread of Toxoplasma gondii in waterfowl is of interest for elucidating the potential involvement of these birds in maintaining the parasitic life cycle because birds are exposed to these parasites. Sera from 103 adult, free-range game birds, representing 13 different species living in the Italian wetlands, were examined using modified agglutination tests for antibodies specific to T. gondii . In seropositive birds, the brain and heart were homogenized and DNA was extracted to perform nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and genotyping. Out of the 103 serum samples, 9 (8.7%) were scored as positive with titers ranging from 1/20 to 1/160. The seropositive animals corresponded to 4 of the species: Anas platyrhynchos (mallard; 2/17), Anas clypeata (northern shoveller; 2/11), Anas crecca (common teal; 3/41), and Gallinago gallinago (common snipe; 2/8). Parasite DNA was detected in 3 out of 9 brain samples, while the PCR results from the heart specimens were negative in all of the birds. The occurrence of non-clonal types of T. gondii was suggested in all cases. In conclusion, we describe the first documented detection of DNA of T. gondii in tissues from the northern shoveller and common teal, thereby extending the range of intermediate hosts for this parasite.

Tolf C, Bengtsson D, Rodrigues D, Latorre-Margalef N, Wille M, Figueiredo ME, Jankowska-Hjortaas M, Germundsson A, Duby PY, Lebarbenchon C, Gauthier-Clerc M, Olsen B, Waldenstrom J	PLoS One	 2012;7(11):e49002	 doi: 101371/journalpone0049002 Epub 2012 Nov 7	During recent years, extensive amounts of data have become available regarding influenza A virus (IAV) in wild birds in northern Europe, while information from southern Europe is more limited. Here, we present an IAV surveillance study conducted in western Portugal 2008-2009, analyzing 1653 samples from six different species of waterfowl, with the majority of samples taken from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Overall 4.4% of sampled birds were infected. The sampling results revealed a significant temporal variation in the IAV prevalence, including a pronounced peak among predominantly young birds in June, indicating that IAV circulate within breeding populations in the wetlands of western Portugal. The H10N7 and H9N2 subtypes were predominant among isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of H10N7, H9N2 and H11N3 virus showed that sequences from Portugal were closely related to viral sequences from Central Europe as well as to IAVs isolated in the southern parts of Africa, reflecting Portugal's position on the European-African bird migratory flyway. This study highlights the importance of Portugal as a migratory crossroad for IAV, connecting breeding stationary waterfowl with birds migrating between continents which enable transmission and spread of IAV.
484	23130574	Corticosterone, cortisol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase and uric acid plasma concentrations during foie gras production in male mule ducks (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina moschata).	Flament A, Delleur V, Poulipoulis A, Marlier D	Br Poult Sci	 2012;53(4):408-13	 doi: 101080/000716682012711468	1. Corticosterone, cortisol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and uric acid (UA) plasma concentration were measured at 8 (7 days after group housing), 12 (after 7 days of force feeding) and 13 weeks of age (at slaughter after 12 days of force feeding), and 45 min after an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test at 8 weeks of age in 12 male mule ducks in an on-farm experiment. 2. No significant increase of corticosterone was found during the force-feeding period compared with the concentration after housing. 3. Comparison of corticosterone and cortisol values indicates that cortisol can be considered as a reliable acute stress indicator in future routine examinations. 4. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides and aspartate aminotransferase increased progressively from pre-force feeding period to slaughtering. 5. Plasma concentrations of uric acid increased from the start at 8 weeks of age to the mid-force feeding period but no difference was noticed between the mid-force feeding period and slaughtering. 6. It is concluded that acute stress induced by force-feeding is similar at the beginning and end of the commercial production of foie gras.
485	23121919	Avian schistosomes and human cercarial dermatitis in a wildlife refuge in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran.	Gohardehi S, Fakhar M, Madjidaei M	Zoonoses Public Health	 2013 Sep;60(6):442-7	 doi: 101111/zph12020 Epub 2012 Nov 2	Each year, hundreds of aquatic migratory birds migrate from northern hemisphere to the Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. Little information is available on prevalence and density of schistosomes in water birds in Iran and around the world. The objectives of this study were to determine definitive and intermediate hosts of avian schistosomes as well as to assess human cercarial dermatitis (HCD) in a wildlife refuge in Mazandaran Province. Of 1106 examined people, 589 (53.2%) had maculopapular rashes mainly on feet but also on hand. The majority of cases were adults and local residents. Of 260 ducks, 41 (15.8%) were found to be infected with Trichobilharzia spp. eggs or adult worms. Prevalence was highest in Anas clypeata and Anas platyrhynchos, 79% and 18.9%, respectively. A total of 1.2% snails, examined by both shedding and crushing methods, were infected with furcocercariae belonging to avian schistosomes. The most frequently infected snail was Lymnaea gedrosiana (5.9%). Our results showed that cercarial dermatitis and avian schistosomiasis is a common and yet neglected disease in this area. Anas clypeata played the most important role in exposing snails to miracidia in ponds and paddy fields. Moreover, because of the high prevalence in ducks and high prevalence of HCD in the region, it is considered as a new endemic focus in Iran.
486	23112840	Identification, expression and activity analyses of five novel duck beta-defensins.	Ma D, Zhang K, Zhang M, Xin S, Liu X, Han Z, Shao Y, Liu S	PLoS One	 2012;7(10):e47743	 doi: 101371/journalpone0047743 Epub 2012 Oct 24	In the current study, five novel avian beta-defensins (AvBDs) were identified and characterized in tissues from Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The nucleotide sequences of these cDNAs comprised 198 bp, 182 bp, 201 bp, 204 bp, and 168 bp, and encoded 65, 60, 66, 67, and 55 amino acids, respectively. Homology, characterization and comparison of these genes with AvBD from other avian species confirmed that they were Apl_AvBD1, 3, 5, 6, and 16. Recombinant AvBDs were produced and purified by expressing these genes in Escherichia coli. In addition, peptides were synthesized according to the respective AvBD sequences. Investigation of the antibacterial activity of the Apl_AvBDs showed that all of them exhibited antibacterial activity against all 12 bacteria investigated (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In addition, the antibacterial activity of all of the AvBDs against M. tetragenus and P. multocida decreased significantly in the presence of 150 mM NaCl (P<0.01). None of the AvBDs showed hemolytic activity. Consistent with their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, the five novel Apl_AvBDs inhibited replication of duck hepatitis virus (DHV) in vitro significantly (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of all five Apl_AvBD in most tissues, including immune organs and the liver, was upregulated in response to DHV infection at different time points. These findings provide evidence that these defensins activate the immune response to combat microbial infection.

Kraus RH, van Hooft P, Megens HJ, Tsvey A, Fokin SY, Ydenberg RC, Prins HH	Mol Ecol	 2013 Jan;22(1):41-55	 doi: 101111/mec12098 Epub 2012 Oct 30	Knowledge about population structure and connectivity of waterfowl species, especially mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), is a priority because of recent outbreaks of avian influenza. Ringing studies that trace large-scale movement patterns have to date been unable to detect clearly delineated mallard populations. We employed 363 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in combination with population genetics and phylogeographical approaches to conduct a population genomic test of panmixia in 801 mallards from 45 locations worldwide. Basic population genetic and phylogenetic methods suggest no or very little population structure on continental scales. Nor could individual-based structuring algorithms discern geographical structuring. Model-based coalescent analyses for testing models of population structure pointed to strong genetic connectivity among the world's mallard population. These diverse approaches all support the conclusion that there is a lack of clear population structure, suggesting that the world's mallards, perhaps with minor exceptions, form a single large, mainly interbreeding population.
488	23060500	Intestinal excretion of a wild bird-origin H3N8 low pathogenic avian influenza virus in mallards (Anas Platyrhynchos).	Brown JD, Berghaus RD, Costa TP, Poulson R, Carter DL, Lebarbenchon C, Stallknecht DE	J Wildl Dis	 2012 Oct;48(4):991-8	 doi: 107589/2011-09-280	Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and other dabbling ducks in the genus Anas are an important component of the wild bird reservoir for avian influenza (AI) virus; these viruses are maintained in migratory duck populations through a fecal-oral transmission route. We provide a detailed characterization of intestinal viral shedding in Mallards infected with a wild bird-origin low pathogenic (LP) AI virus. Five of eight, 1-mo-old Mallards inoculated with a high dose of an H3N8 LP AI virus became infected as determined by reisolation and seroconversion. Infected birds excreted high concentrations of virus for up to 14 days postinoculation (DPI) without exhibiting overt clinical signs of disease. The pattern of viral shedding was relatively consistent between individual birds, with peak shedding on 2-3 DPI and a progressive decline over the remainder of infection. Detection of viral shedding varied depending on sample type (excrement sample or cloacal swab) and diagnostic test (virus isolation or real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Our data provide detailed insights into the intestinal excretion of an H3N8 LP AI virus in Mallards and the performance of diagnostic assays commonly used in wild bird surveillance. Such information is valuable for estimating potential risks for spillover of LP AI viruses from Mallards to domestic animals, developing accurate transmission models for Mallard populations and facilitating the interpretation and comparison of surveillance results from different studies.
489	23050463	Differences in pathogenicity, response to vaccination, and innate immune responses in different types of ducks infected with a virulent H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus from Vietnam.	Cagle C, Wasilenko J, Adams SC, Cardona CJ, To TL, Nguyen T, Spackman E, Suarez DL, Smith D, Shepherd E, Roth J, Pantin-Jackwood MJ	Avian Dis	 2012 Sep;56(3):479-87	 doi: 101637/10030-120511-Reg1	In a previous study, we found clear differences in pathogenicity and response to vaccination against H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI; HA dade 2.3.4) between Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) and Muscovy (Cairina moschata) ducks vaccinated using a commercial inactivated vaccine (Re-1). The objective of the present study was to further investigate the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI viruses in different species of ducks by examining clinical signs and innate immune responses to infection with a different strain of H5N1 HPAI virus (HA clade 1) in two domestic ducks, Pekin and Muscovy, and one wild-type duck, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Protection conferred by vaccination using the Re-1 vaccine against infection with this virus was also compared between Pekin and Muscovy ducks. Differences in pathogenicity were observed among the virus-infected ducks, as the Muscovy ducks died 2 days earlier than did the Pekin and mallard ducks, and they presented more-severe neurologic signs. Conversely, the Pekin and mallard ducks had significantly higher body temperatures at 2 days postinfection (dpi) than did the Muscovy ducks, indicating possible differences in innate immune responses. However, similar expression of innate immune-related genes was found in the spleens of virus-infected ducks at this time point. In all three duck species, there was up-regulation of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, CCL19, RIG-I, and MHC class I and down-regulation of MHC class II, but variable expression of IL-18 and TLR7. As in our previous study, vaccinated Muscovy ducks showed less protection against virus infection than did Pekin ducks, as evidenced by the higher mortality and higher number of Muscovy ducks shedding virus when compared to Pekin ducks. In conclusion, infection with an H5N1 HPAI virus produced a systemic infection with high mortality in all three duck species; however, the disease was more severe in Muscovy ducks, which also had a poor response to vaccination. The differences in response to virus infection could not be explained by differences in the innate immune responses between the different types of ducks when examined at 2 days dpi, and earlier time points need to be evaluated.
490	23045806	Cryptosporidium baileyi--infection in Red-breasted Merganser (Mergus serrator) ducklings from a zoological garden.	Schulze C, Kammerling J, Kutzer P, Engelhardt A, Richter B	Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr	 2012 Sep-Oct;125(9-10):428-31		Infection of the Bursa of Fabricius with Cryptosporidium baileyi was diagnosed in a group of hand reared Red-breasted Merganser (Mergus serrator) ducklings during one breeding season in a German zoological garden.The birds had died in an emaciated and anaemic state after problems with spontaneous feeding. The bursae were infected with moderate to high numbers of cryptosporidia, which were associated with hyperplasia, degeneration and sloughing of the affected epithelial cells and mild heterophilic bursitis, lesions typically seen in bursal cryptosporidiosis in other avian species. In addition, lymphatic tissue was nearly absent, which was probably caused by chronic stress and malnutrition related to the rearing of these highly stress-sensitive birds in an artificial environment. Companion ducklings from stress-resistant, spontaneously feeding species from the zoological collection were used to calm the Mergansers, but may have introduced the cryptosporidia into the rearing boxes. Another possible source for the introduction of C. baileyi were adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), which were used to increase the hatching rate by a phase of natural breeding in the middle third of the incubation period of the Merganser eggs.
491	23031599	Inheritance of duration of fertility in female common ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) inseminated in pure breeding or in inter-generic crossbreeding with Muscovy drakes (Cairina moschata).	Brun JM, Mialon MM, Sellier N, Brillard JP, Rouvier R	Animal	 2012 Nov;6(11):1731-7	 doi: 101017/S1751731112001206	Ducks (common, Muscovy and mule ducks) are the third most important bird species in animal production for human consumption worldwide. Our study aimed to improve the efficiency of mule duck breeding, thus contributing to the efficiency of food production in general. In the common duck, females can be bred either with males of the same species (i.e. in pure breeding (PB) subscript p) or in inter-generic crossbreeding (CB; subscript c) with Muscovy drakes to produce the hybrid mule duck. The aim of the present study was to estimate the genetic parameters of several indicators of duration of fertility, considered to be a trait of the female duck, within and between breeding schemes and, in particular, to estimate the purebred-crossbred genetic correlation (rg pc). These indicators were maximum duration of fertility (MD), that is, the time interval between insemination and the last fertilised egg, the number of fertile eggs (F) and of hatched ducklings (H) after a single artificial insemination (AI), and the fertility rate over days 2 to 12 after AI (F 2,12), taking three sub-periods (F 2,4, F 5,8, F 9,12) into account. A total of 494 females and 2655 inseminations were involved. PB resulted in longer duration of fertility (MD p = 8.1 v. MD c = 6.4 days). Heritability (h 2) was higher for MD p (estimate +/- s.e.: 0.27 +/- 0.04) than for MD c (0.15 +/- 0.04), but both traits were highly correlated with each other (rg pc = 0.85 +/- 0.07). F p and F c had similar heritability (h 2 around 0.24) and displayed a high genetic correlation (0.78 +/- 0.07). The same was true for H p and H c (h 2 around 0.17 and rg pc = 0.88 +/- 0.05). The heritability estimates were 0.24 +/- 0.03 for F 2,12p and 0.20 +/- 0.04 for F 2,12c, with a 0.80 +/- 0.07 genetic correlation between each other. Permanent environmental effects influenced MD p far less than MD c, F p less than F c, but H p and H c to the same extent. The high values for rg pc (>0.78) indicated that the same genes are involved in the duration of fertility for both PB and CB. Unlike CB, initial fertility for PB (F 2,4p) was not correlated to overall fertility rate and to duration of fertility and probably involves different genes, if any. In both breeding schemes, indirect selection on F would be better than direct selection on H to improve H, and easier to implement than selection on MD. Moreover, any gain in one breeding scheme will have its correlated counterpart in the other one, because of the high values of rg pc.
492	22991545	Comparison and characteristics of the formation of different adipose tissues in ducks during early growth.	Kou J, Wang WX, Liu HH, Pan ZX, He T, Hu JW, Li L, Wang JW	Poult Sci	 2012 Oct;91(10):2588-97	 doi: 103382/ps2012-02273	The objective of the current research was to investigate the pattern of subcutaneous adipose tissue growth during Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) early development and to determine the reasons for regional differences. The morphological characteristics in 5 regions of subcutaneous tissue, including the neck area (NSF), chest area (CSF), lower abdomen area (ASF), back area (BSF), and leg area (LSF), were analyzed by comparing the morphology of the sections, adipocyte volume and number, and lipid content from wk 1 to 8. Moreover, the mRNA expression of several molecular marker genes, including 47-kDa tail interacting protein (TIP47), adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), and perilipin, were detected from wk 1 to 8 using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results revealed that the average cell number declined greatly as fattening proceeded (except in the NSF) and changed very little after wk 4 in all 5 regions. In contrast, the average cell volume and triglyceride content per cell increased gradually during early duck growth. The BSF and LSF lipid content had a different pattern of change than the other regions. The NSF, CSF, and ASF regions had the highest lipid content values at all stages, the BSF was intermediate, and the LSF was the lowest at all weeks except wk 3. The highest TIP47 expression level was found in the NSF from wk 1 to 2 and BSF at wk 1. The relative expression level of TIP47 was higher in the CSF than in the ASF and BSF at wk 4, and was higher in the NSF than in the ASF at wk 6. The highest levels of ADRP and perilipin were detected in the LSF. These results suggest that a combination of adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy is mainly responsible for the development of duck adipose tissue before wk 4, after which adipose expansion is accomplished by adipocyte hypertrophy only. Adipocyte hyperplastic and hypertrophic capacity, fat storage capacity, and metabolic activity may be partial explanations for the regional differences during duck growth.
493	22988769	Phylogeography of the mallard Anas platyrhynchos from Eurasia inferred from sequencing of the mtDNA control region	Kulikova IV, Poysa H, Zhuravlev IuN	Genetika	 2012 Jul;48(7):835-43		Phylogenetic relationships, demographic history, and geographic distribution of the mtDNA haplotypes of the mallard Anas platyrhynchos were examined in three populations, Indian, Northern European, and Far Eastern. Two divergent haplotype groups, A and B, were found in the Far Eastern population, while haplotypes identified in Northern European and Far Eastern populations were exclusively of the A group. The presence of B group haplotypes in the Far Eastern population can be explained either in terms of hybridization of the mallard with spot-billed duck Anas zonorhyncha at the south of the Russian Far East, or by the mtDNA paraphyly in mallards. In general, mallards from Eurasia were characterized by low genetic population differentiation along with slightly expressed phylogeographic structure. The most differentiated was the population from India (Phi(st) = 0.076-0.077), while the difference between Northern European and Far Eastern populations was extremely low (Phi(st) = 0.0029). Differentiation of Anas platyrhynchos Indian population was determined by the fact that a part of the population, inhabiting southern and eastern coasts of the Hindustan Peninsula, was resident.
494	22971007	Migration strategy affects avian influenza dynamics in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Hill NJ, Takekawa JY, Ackerman JT, Hobson KA, Herring G, Cardona CJ, Runstadler JA, Boyce WM	Mol Ecol	 2012 Dec;21(24):5986-99	 doi: 101111/j1365-294X201205735x Epub 2012 Sep 13	Studies of pathogen transmission typically overlook that wildlife hosts can include both migrant and resident populations when attempting to model circulation. Through the application of stable isotopes in flight feathers, we estimated the migration strategy of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) occurring on California wintering grounds. Our study demonstrates that mallards- a principal host of avian influenza virus (AIV) in nature, contribute differently to virus gene flow depending on migration strategy. No difference in AIV prevalence was detected between resident (9.6%), intermediate-distance (9.6%) and long-distance migrants (7.4%). Viral diversity among the three groups was also comparable, possibly owing to viral pool mixing when birds converge at wetlands during winter. However, migrants and residents contributed differently to the virus gene pool at wintering wetlands. Migrants introduced virus from northern breeding grounds (Alaska and the NW Pacific Rim) into the wintering population, facilitating gene flow at continental scales, but circulation of imported virus appeared to be limited. In contrast, resident mallards acted as AIV reservoirs facilitating year-round circulation of limited subtypes (i.e. H5N2) at lower latitudes. This study supports a model of virus exchange in temperate regions driven by the convergence of wild birds with separate geographic origins and exposure histories.
495	22940115	Effect of preen oil on plumage bacteria: an experimental test with the mallard.	Giraudeau M, Czirjak GA, Duval C, Bretagnolle V, Gutierrez C, Guillon N, Heeb P	Behav Processes	 2013 Jan;92:1-5	 doi: 101016/jbeproc201208001 Epub 2012 Aug 23	Feathers are essential for avian thermoregulation, communication or flight and a reduction of plumage condition may alter these functions and reduce individual fitness. Recently, descriptive studies provided evidence that birds carry feather-degrading bacteria on their plumage that have the ability to degrade feathers rapidly under laboratory conditions. If such bacteria reduce avian fitness, natural selection should favour the evolution of anti-bacterial defences to limit the effects of these detrimental microorganisms. Preening behaviour and associated preen gland secretions have been proposed as the main factor used by birds to limit feather-degrading bacterial growth and some recent in vitro studies provided evidence that uropygial oil inhibited the growth of some keratinolytic strains in passerines. However, preen oil antimicrobial properties remained to be experimentally tested in vivo. We conducted an experiment with mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) onto which we fixed a removable mechanism that blocked access to the uropygial gland in a first group of mallards, whilst birds in a second group had the same removable mechanism but access to their gland and a third group of birds had normal access to their gland. We found no significant effect of our treatment on total and feather-degrading bacterial loads. Three hypotheses may explain the discrepancy between our results and previous in vitro studies. First, in vitro studies may have over-estimated the bactericidal properties of the preen oil. Second, preen gland deprivation may have affected only a small portion of the feather-degrading bacterial community. Third, ducks and passerine oils might have different bactericidal properties.
496	22859590	Reassortant influenza A viruses in wild duck populations: effects on viral shedding and persistence in water.	Lebarbenchon C, Sreevatsan S, Lefevre T, Yang M, Ramakrishnan MA, Brown JD, Stallknecht DE	Proc Biol Sci	 2012 Oct 7;279(1744):3967-75	 doi: 101098/rspb20121271 Epub 2012 Aug 1	Wild ducks of the genus Anas represent the natural hosts for a large genetic diversity of influenza A viruses. In these hosts, co-infections with different virus genotypes are frequent and result in high rates of genetic reassortment. Recent genomic data have provided information regarding the pattern and frequency of these reassortant viruses in duck populations; however, potential consequences on viral shedding and maintenance in the environment have not been investigated. On the basis of full-genome sequencing, we identified five virus genotypes, in a wild duck population in northwestern Minnesota (USA), that naturally arose from genetic reassortments. We investigated the effects of influenza A virus genotype on the viral shedding pattern in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and the duration of infectivity in water, under different temperature regimens. Overall, we found that variation in the viral genome composition of these isolates had limited effects on duration, extent and pattern of viral shedding, as well as on the reduction of infectivity in water over time. These results support that, in wild ducks, functionally equivalent gene segments could be maintained in virus populations with no fitness costs when genetic reassortments occur.
497	22855613	Precocial hindlimbs and altricial forelimbs: partitioning ontogenetic strategies in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Dial TR, Carrier DR	J Exp Biol	 2012 Nov 1;215(Pt 21):3703-10	 doi: 101242/jeb057380 Epub 2012 Aug 1	Precocial development, in which juveniles are relatively mature at hatching or birth, is more common among vertebrates than altricial development, and is likely to be the basal condition. Altricial development characterizes many birds and mammals and is generally viewed as an alternate strategy, promoting fast growth rates, short developmental periods and relatively poor locomotor performance prior to attaining adult size. Many aquatic birds such as Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans), Charadriformes (gulls and terns) and Gruiformes (rails) undergo distinctive developmental trajectories, in that hatchlings are able to run and swim the day they hatch, yet they do not begin to fly until fully grown. We hypothesized that there should be tradeoffs in apportioning bone and muscle mass to the hindlimb and forelimb that could account for these patterns in locomotor behavior within the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Growth of the musculoskeletal system in the forelimbs and hindlimbs was measured and compared with maximal aquatic and terrestrial sprint speeds and aerial descent rates throughout the 2-month-long mallard ontogenetic period. At 30 days post hatching, when body mass is 50% of adult values, hindlimb muscle mass averages 90% and forelimb muscle mass averages 10% of adult values; similarly, bone growth (length and width) in the hindlimbs and forelimbs averages 90 and 60% of adult values, respectively. The attainment of mallard locomotor performance parallels the morphological maturation of forelimb and hindlimb morphometrics - hindlimb performance initiates just after hatching at a relatively high level (~50% adult values) and gradually improves throughout the first month of development, while forelimb performance is relatively non-existent at hatching (~10% adult values), experiencing delayed and dramatic improvement in function, and maturing at the time of fledging. This divergence in ontogenetic strategy between locomotor modules could allow developing Anseriformes to inhabit aquatic, predator-reduced refuges without relying on flight for juvenile escape. Furthermore, by freeing the forelimbs from locomotor demand early in ontogeny, Anseriformes may bypass the potential canalization (i.e. retention) of juvenile form present within their precocial hindlimbs, to dramatically depart in forelimb form and function in the adult.
498	22855612	Ontogeny of aerodynamics in mallards: comparative performance and developmental implications.	Dial TR, Heers AM, Tobalske BW	J Exp Biol	 2012 Nov 1;215(Pt 21):3693-702	 doi: 101242/jeb062018 Epub 2012 Aug 1	Wing morphology correlates with flight performance and ecology among adult birds, yet the impact of wing development on aerodynamic capacity is not well understood. Recent work using chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar), a precocial flier, indicates that peak coefficients of lift and drag (C(L) and C(D)) and lift-to-drag ratio (C(L):C(D)) increase throughout ontogeny and that these patterns correspond with changes in feather microstructure. To begin to place these results in a comparative context that includes variation in life-history strategy, we used a propeller and force-plate model to study aerodynamic force production across a developmental series of the altricial-flying mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). We observed the same trend in mallards as reported for chukar in that coefficients of vertical (C(V)) and horizontal force (C(H)) and C(V):C(H) ratio increased with age, and that measures of gross-wing morphology (aspect ratio, camber and porosity) in mallards did not account for intraspecific trends in force production. Rather, feather microstructure (feather unfurling, rachis width, feather asymmetry and barbule overlap) all were positively correlated with peak C(V):C(H). Throughout ontogeny, mallard primary feathers became stiffer and less transmissive to air at both macroscale (between individual feathers) and microscale (between barbs/barbules/barbicels) levels. Differences between species were manifest primarily as heterochrony of aerodynamic force development. Chukar wings generated measurable aerodynamic forces early (<8 days), and improved gradually throughout a 100 day ontogenetic period. Mallard wings exhibited delayed aerodynamic force production until just prior to fledging (day 60), and showed dramatic improvement within a condensed 2-week period. These differences in timing may be related to mechanisms of escape used by juveniles, with mallards swimming to safety and chukar flap-running up slopes to take refuge. Future comparative work should test whether the need for early onset of aerodynamic force production in the chukar, compared with delayed, but rapid, change in the mallard wing, leads to a limited repertoire of flight behavior in adult chukar compared with mallards.
499	22816511	Consecutive natural influenza a virus infections in sentinel mallards in the evident absence of subtype-specific hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies.	Globig A, Fereidouni SR, Harder TC, Grund C, Beer M, Mettenleiter TC, Starick E	Transbound Emerg Dis	 2013 Oct;60(5):395-402	 doi: 101111/j1865-1682201201357x Epub 2012 Jul 22	Dabbling ducks, particularly Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) have been frequently and consistently reported to play a pivotal role as a reservoir of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIV). From October 2006 to November 2008, hand-raised Mallard ducks kept at a pond in an avifaunistically rich area of Southern Germany served as sentinel birds in the AIV surveillance programme in Germany. The pond was regularly visited by several species of dabbling ducks. A flock of sentinel birds, consisting of the same 16 individual birds during the whole study period, was regularly tested virologically and serologically for AIV infections. Swab samples were screened by RT-qPCR and, if positive, virus was isolated in embryonated chicken eggs. Serum samples were tested by the use of competitive ELISA and hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay. Sequences of full-length hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes were phylogenetically analysed. Four episodes of infections with Eurasian-type AIV occurred in August (H6N8), October/November (H3N2, H2N3) 2007, in January (H3N2) and September (H3N8) 2008. The HA and NA genes of the H3N2 viruses of October 2007 and January 2008 were almost identical rendering the possibility of a re-introduction of that virus from the environment of the sentinel flock highly likely. The HA of the H3N8 virus of September 2008 belonged to a different cluster. As a correlate of the humoral immune response, titres of nucleocapsid protein-specific antibodies fluctuated in correlation with the course of AIV infection episodes. However, no specific systemic response of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies could be demonstrated even if homologous viral antigens were used. Besides being useful as early indicators for the circulation of influenza viruses in a specific region, the sentinel ducks also contributed to gaining insights into the ecobiology of AIV infection in aquatic wild birds.
500	22808008	The development of a genome wide SNP set for the Barnacle goose Branta leucopsis.	Jonker RM, Zhang Q, Van Hooft P, Loonen MJ, Van der Jeugd HP, Crooijmans RP, Groenen MA, Prins HH, Kraus RH	PLoS One	 2012;7(7):e38412	 doi: 101371/journalpone0038412 Epub 2012 Jul 10	Migratory birds are of particular interest for population genetics because of the high connectivity between habitats and populations. A high degree of connectivity requires using many genetic markers to achieve the required statistical power, and a genome wide SNP set can fit this purpose. Here we present the development of a genome wide SNP set for the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis, a model species for the study of bird migration. We used the genome of a different waterfowl species, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, as a reference to align Barnacle Goose second generation sequence reads from an RRL library and detected 2188 SNPs genome wide. Furthermore, we used chimeric flanking sequences, merged from both Mallard and Barnacle Goose DNA sequence information, to create primers for validation by genotyping. Validation with a 384 SNP genotyping set resulted in 374 (97%) successfully typed SNPs in the assay, of which 358 (96%) were polymorphic. Additionally, we validated our SNPs on relatively old (30 years) museum samples, which resulted in a success rate of at least 80%. This shows that museum samples could be used in standard SNP genotyping assays. Our study also shows that the genome of a related species can be used as reference to detect genome wide SNPs in birds, because genomes of birds are highly conserved. This is illustrated by the use of chimeric flanking sequences, which showed that the incorporation of flanking nucleotides from Mallard into Barnacle Goose sequences lead to equal genotyping performance when compared to flanking sequences solely composed of Barnacle Goose sequence.
501	22771313	Proteomic analysis of liver development of lean Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Zheng A, Liu G, Zhang Y, Hou S, Chang W, Zhang S, Cai H, Chen G	J Proteomics	 2012 Sep 18;75(17):5396-413	 doi: 101016/jjprot201206019 Epub 2012 Jul 4	The liver plays vital roles in digestion, metabolism and immune defense. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of nutrient metabolism and antioxidation of lean Pekin duck liver from hatching to slaughter, the proteome changes were investigated using 2-DE, MS, quantitative real-time PCR and bioinformatics. A total of 59 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Proteins involved in transportation were highly up-regulated in newborn ducks whereas 37 proteins associated with metabolism, defense and antioxidation were up-regulated in adult ducks. The over-expression of proteins at the last developmental stage presumably occurs to fulfill the needs of multiple functions of the liver. However, the over-expressed proteins related to transportation during the first developmental stage are involved in maintaining the high basal metabolism of newborn ducks. The functional enrichment analysis also confirmed these results. Furthermore, the protein interaction network predicted 28 proteins acting as key nodes for liver development. The validated expression between proteins and genes provides us target genes for future genetic analyses to improve the health and performance of these ducks. These significant advanced proteome data expand our knowledge on the physiology of the duck liver, thereby providing a potentially valuable foundation for molecular breeding to enhance feed efficiency and immunity and for optimizing the feeding strategy.
502	22723478	Conditioned response to a magnetic anomaly in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) involves the trigeminal nerve.	Freire R, Dunston E, Fowler EM, McKenzie GL, Quinn CT, Michelsen J	J Exp Biol	 2012 Jul 15;215(Pt 14):2399-404	 doi: 101242/jeb068312	There have been recent calls to develop protocols that collect unambiguous measures of behaviour using automatic techniques in conditioning experiments on magnetic orientation. Here, we describe an automated technique for recording the behaviour of Pekin ducks in a conditioning test that allows them to express unrestricted searching behaviour. Pekin ducks were trained to find hidden food in one corner of a square arena below which was placed a magnetic coil that produced a local magnetic anomaly. The trigeminal nerve was anaesthetised by injection of lignocaine hydrochloride 2-3 mm caudal to the medial canthus of each eye, medial to the globe, prior to the presentation of unrewarded tests. Lignocaine-treated ducks showed no initial preference for the magnetic anomaly whereas saline-treated control ducks showed a significant preference at the same age. A second experiment was undertaken in which the trigeminal nerve was surgically severed and 2-3 mm removed, and this surgery abolished the previously observed preference for the corner with the magnetic coil in a small number of ducks. These data show that Pekin ducks are able to detect and use magnetic stimuli to guide unrestricted search behaviour and are consistent with a hypothesis of magnetoreception involving a putative cluster of magnetite in the upper beak.
503	22705491	Of the importance of metabolic phases in the understanding of oxidative stress in prolonged fasting and refeeding.	Sylvie G, Marion K, Yvon le M, Jean-Patrice R, Criscuolo F	Physiol Biochem Zool	 2012 Jul-Aug;85(4):415-20	 doi: 101086/666364 Epub 2012 May 29	Life phases such as migration or reproduction may partly (or totally) prohibit food accessibility, making regulation of the energy balance one of the main challenges faced by wild organisms. Although long-term fasting is common in a number of species, it has been reported to be detrimental for the organism, notably because it induces oxidative stress. However, fasting metabolism is characterized by successive metabolic adaptations that are likely to be different in terms of stress, and no previous studies, to our knowledge, have tested the dynamics of changes in oxidative balance in relation to the metabolic phases of fasting. Our study provides a first insight into this relationship by inducing prolonged fasting and subsequent refeeding in captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Both plasmatic antioxidant and oxidative damage levels were observed to be lower during fasting. Oxidative damage levels decreased by 95% during fasting, and they surprisingly remained at low levels even after 3 d of refeeding. In contrast, restoration of the antioxidant barrier was observed from the third day of refeeding onward, and it thus preceded the increase in oxidative damage levels. Therefore, under our experimental conditions, long-term fasting was not associated with marked oxidative stress in mallards. Because data interpretations may be influenced by concomitant metabolic states, we underline the importance of taking metabolic phases into account when studying oxidative stress during fasting.
504	22666443	Differential effects of early- and late-life access to carotenoids on adult immune function and ornamentation in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Butler MW, McGraw KJ	PLoS One	 2012;7(5):e38043	 doi: 101371/journalpone0038043 Epub 2012 May 30	Environmental conditions early in life can affect an organism's phenotype at adulthood, which may be tuned to perform optimally in conditions that mimic those experienced during development (Environmental Matching hypothesis), or may be generally superior when conditions during development were of higher quality (Silver Spoon hypothesis). Here, we tested these hypotheses by examining how diet during development interacted with diet during adulthood to affect adult sexually selected ornamentation and immune function in male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards have yellow, carotenoid-pigmented beaks that are used in mate choice, and the degree of beak coloration has been linked to adult immune function. Using a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design, we reared mallards on diets containing either low or high levels of carotenoids (nutrients that cannot be synthesized de novo) throughout the period of growth, and then provided adults with one of these two diets while simultaneously quantifying beak coloration and response to a variety of immune challenges. We found that both developmental and adult carotenoid supplementation increased circulating carotenoid levels during dietary treatment, but that birds that received low-carotenoid diets during development maintained relatively higher circulating carotenoid levels during an adult immune challenge. Individuals that received low levels of carotenoids during development had larger phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced cutaneous immune responses at adulthood; however, dietary treatment during development and adulthood did not affect antibody response to a novel antigen, nitric oxide production, natural antibody levels, hemolytic capacity of the plasma, or beak coloration. However, beak coloration prior to immune challenges positively predicted PHA response, and strong PHA responses were correlated with losses in carotenoid-pigmented coloration. In sum, we did not find consistent support for either the Environmental Matching or Silver Spoon hypotheses. We then describe a new hypothesis that should be tested in future studies examining developmental plasticity.
505	22652187	De novo lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissues of ducks during early growth stages after hatching.	Ding F, Pan Z, Kou J, Li L, Xia L, Hu S, Liu H, Wang J	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 2012 Sep;163(1):154-60	 doi: 101016/jcbpb201205014 Epub 2012 May 29	In vivo de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in the liver and adipose tissues of ducks during early developmental stages after hatching has not previously been investigated. In this study, female Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) at weeks 1 to 8 post-hatching were selected for experimentation. We measured the mRNA levels of 6 DNL-related genes in the duck liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue and abdominal adipose tissue by real-time PCR during the 8 weeks. Correlations of the plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) concentrations with fat deposition at these sites were also detected during growth. Our results showed that fat content was highest in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and lowest in the liver during the growth period we studied. Additionally, plasma VLDL and TG were significantly associated with lipid content in adipose tissue (P<0.05), but not in the liver. Lastly, in the growing birds, the expression levels of lipogenic genes (with the exceptions SREBP-1c and SCD1) were much higher in the liver than in the adipose tissues, and the maximal expression levels of these genes occurred at week 4 or 5 at these sites. These findings indicated that the main site of DNL is always the liver in post-hatching ducks, and adipose tissues are of little importance for DNL. Taken together, our results suggested that the plasma lipoproteins contribute greatly to fat deposition in adipose tissues originating from hepatic lipogenesis.
506	22645836	Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in a mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Evans EE, Jones MP, Crews AJ, Newkirk K	J Avian Med Surg	 2012 Mar;26(1):22-8	 doi: 101647/2010-0451	A 3-year-old male, hybrid mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was presented with a 2-year history of progressive, ascending paresis and paralysis. On presentation, the bird was in sternal recumbency and displayed intermittent focal seizures and intention tremors. Proprioceptive deficits and absent withdrawal reflexes were observed in both pelvic limbs, wing extension was limited, and reflexes were diminished bilaterally. Other findings included emaciation and dehydration. Results of a complete blood count and plasma biochemical analysis revealed anemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperuricemia. Radiographs were unremarkable and results of an Aspergillus antibody were weakly positive. The duck went into cardiopulmonary arrest and died approximately 1 hour after initiating treatment with intravenous crystalloid fluids. A postmortem diagnosis of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) was made based on the presence of neuronal granular cytoplasmic material that was autofluorescent and stained with periodic acid-Schiff and Luxol fast blue. To our knowledge, this is only the second case report of NCL in an avian species and the first in waterfowl.
507	22645833	Marbofloxacin disposition after intravenous administration of a single dose in wild mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Garcia-Montijano M, de Lucas JJ, Rodriguez C, Gonzalez F, San Andres MI, Waxman S	J Avian Med Surg	 2012 Mar;26(1):6-10	 doi: 101647/2011-0071	Marbofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone developed specifically for veterinary use, has demonstrated considerable pharmokinetic variation among avian species. The goal of this study was to determine the disposition kinetics of marbofloxacin in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) after a single intravenous injection. Six wild mallard ducks were used in the study. Marbofloxacin was injected at a dose of 2 mg/kg into the basilic vein, and blood was subsequently collected at regular intervals from each bird. Plasma marbofloxacin concentrations were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography. The volume of distribution at steady state was 1.78 +/- 0.37 L/kg, and the total plasma clearance was 0.59 +/- 0.08 L/kg per hour. Marbofloxacin had a relatively short permanence, with a elimination half-life of 2.81 +/- 1.20 hours, a terminal half-life of 2.43 +/- 0.61 hours, and a mean residence time of 2.99 +/- 0.52 hour. The maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were 1.34 +/- 0.27 microg/mL and 3.75 +/- 0.56 microg x h/mL, respectively. Values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), Cmax, and AUC have been used to predict the clinical efficacy of a drug in treating bacterial infections, with a Cmax: MIC value of 10 and an AUC: MIC ratio of 125-250 associated with optimal bactericidal effects. By using the study data and MIC breakpoints of 0.125 microg/mL or 0.2 microg/mL, values derived for Cmax: MIC were 9.37 +/- 0.99 and 5.85 +/- 0.62, respectively, and for AUC: MIC were 29.99 +/- 4.51 and 18.74 +/- 2.82, respectively. By using MIC values of 0.125 and 0.2 microg/mL and a target AUC: MIC = 125, the calculated optimal daily marbofloxacin dosages for mallard ducks were 9.24 and 14.78 mg/kg, respectively. These results suggest that, primarily because of the high total plasma clearance observed, the marbofloxacin dose for treatment of bacterial diseases in mallard ducks should be increased after intravenous administration. Intravenous doses of 10-15 mg/kg should be assessed by studying their potential toxicity and efficacy in sick birds.
508	22609802	Evaluation of two different swab transport systems in the detection of avian influenza virus excretion from infected Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Roelandt S, Outtrim L, Browning C, Alexander DJ, Brown IH, Irvine RM	J Virol Methods	 2012 Sep;184(1-2):8-14	 doi: 101016/jjviromet201204007 Epub 2012 May 16	The role of wild birds in the epidemiology and ecology of influenza A viruses has long been recognised (Alexander, 2007a). As a result of the emergence of a H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus and the apparent role of wild birds in its spread across Asia, Europe and Africa, avian influenza (AI) wild bird surveillance has been implemented in many countries including, since February 2006, a mandatory programme in the European Union (CEC, 2006a). In the present study the detection of virus excreted from Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected experimentally with A/mallard/England/2126/07 (H3N6) was investigated over a fourteen day period post-infection using cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs, with (wet) and without (dry) viral transport medium which were collected from each duck in alternating order. For influenza A virus matrix gene RNA detection, wet oropharyngeal swabs were significantly more sensitive than dry oropharyngeal on days 4-5 after infection. For cloacal samples, dry swabs were equivalent or superior to wet swabs throughout the study. Although differences in detection between dry and wet swabs were observed, the qualitative bird-level results were unaffected, meaning that the infection status of individual birds was correctly determined.
509	22591010	Non-synonymous SNPs in MC1R gene are associated with the extended black variant in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Yu W, Wang C, Xin Q, Li S, Feng Y, Peng X, Gong Y	Anim Genet	 2013 Apr;44(2):214-6	 doi: 101111/j1365-2052201202377x Epub 2012 May 17	In this study, we performed a sequence characterization of the duck melanocortin 1 receptor (alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor) (MC1R) gene to analyze the relationship between MC1R polymorphism and the extended black variant in domestic ducks based on the extended black (E) and non-extended black (e(+) ) allele hypothesis of the duck MC1R gene. Both c.52G>A and c.376G>A substitutions are highly associated with the duck extended black variant (P < 0.01), but the novel c.52G>A substitution is more of a fit for the allele hypothesis of the duck MC1R gene.
510	22558299	DNA vaccine-generated duck polyclonal antibodies as a postexposure prophylactic to prevent hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).	Brocato R, Josleyn M, Ballantyne J, Vial P, Hooper JW	PLoS One	 2012;7(4):e35996	 doi: 101371/journalpone0035996 Epub 2012 Apr 27	Andes virus (ANDV) is the predominant cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in South America and the only hantavirus known to be transmitted person-to-person. There are no vaccines, prophylactics, or therapeutics to prevent or treat this highly pathogenic disease (case-fatality 35-40%). Infection of Syrian hamsters with ANDV results in a disease that closely mimics human HPS in incubation time, symptoms of respiratory distress, and disease pathology. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of two postexposure prophylaxis strategies in the ANDV/hamster lethal disease model. First, we evaluated a natural product, human polyclonal antibody, obtained as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) from a HPS survivor. Second, we used DNA vaccine technology to manufacture a polyclonal immunoglobulin-based product that could be purified from the eggs of vaccinated ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The natural "despeciation" of the duck IgY (i.e., Fc removed) results in an immunoglobulin predicted to be minimally reactogenic in humans. Administration of >/= 5,000 neutralizing antibody units (NAU)/kg of FFP-protected hamsters from lethal disease when given up to 8 days after intranasal ANDV challenge. IgY/IgYDeltaFc antibodies purified from the eggs of DNA-vaccinated ducks effectively neutralized ANDV in vitro as measured by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Administration of 12,000 NAU/kg of duck egg-derived IgY/IgYDeltaFc protected hamsters when administered up to 8 days after intranasal challenge and 5 days after intramuscular challenge. These experiments demonstrate that convalescent FFP shows promise as a postexposure HPS prophylactic. Moreover, these data demonstrate the feasibility of using DNA vaccine technology coupled with the duck/egg system to manufacture a product that could supplement or replace FFP. The DNA vaccine-duck/egg system can be scaled as needed and obviates the necessity of using limited blood products obtained from a small number of HPS survivors. This is the first report demonstrating the in vivo efficacy of any antiviral product produced using DNA vaccine-duck/egg system.
511	22542232	Embryotoxicity of mixtures of weathered crude oil collected from the Gulf of Mexico and Corexit 9500 in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Finch BE, Wooten KJ, Faust DR, Smith PN	Sci Total Environ	 2012 Jun 1;426:155-9	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv201203070 Epub 2012 Apr 26	Dispersants are applied to marine crude oil spills to enhance microbial degradation and reduce impacts of crude oils on ecosystems. In summer 2010, the dispersant Corexit 9500 was applied to crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico. The co-occurrence of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill with nesting efforts of birds in the Gulf region may have resulted in exposure of adult birds, and subsequently bird eggs, to combinations of crude oil and Corexit 9500. The objective of this study was to examine the embryotoxicity of 50:1 and 10:1 mixtures of weathered crude oil collected from the Gulf of Mexico and Corexit 9500 applied to mallard duck eggs. Combinations of weathered crude oil and Corexit 9500 were applied to eggshells of mallard ducks via paintbrush in varying masses ranging from 0.1 to 59.9 mg and 0.1 to 44.9 mg for 50:1 and 10:1 mixtures, respectively. Conservatively derived median lethal applications for 50:1 and 10:1 mixtures of weathered crude oil and Corexit 9500 were 21.3+/-4.9 mg/egg (321.8 mug/g egg) and 33.1+/-11.8 mg/egg (517.0 mug/g egg), respectively. Spleen mass of hatchlings exposed to the 50:1 mixture was the only physiological measure significantly different from controls of both mixtures. Results indicated that decreasing ratios of dispersant relative to weathered crude oil decreased toxicity to mallard embryos. In comparison to treatments of eggs with weathered crude oil alone, toxicity increased when the oil to dispersant ratio was 50:1, but decreased with the mixture that contained more dispersant (10:1).
512	22536424	Disease dynamics and bird migration--linking mallards Anas platyrhynchos and subtype diversity of the influenza A virus in time and space.	Gunnarsson G, Latorre-Margalef N, Hobson KA, Van Wilgenburg SL, Elmberg J, Olsen B, Fouchier RA, Waldenstrom J	PLoS One	 2012;7(4):e35679	 doi: 101371/journalpone0035679 Epub 2012 Apr 20	The mallard Anas platyrhynchos is a reservoir species for influenza A virus in the northern hemisphere, with particularly high prevalence rates prior to as well as during its prolonged autumn migration. It has been proposed that the virus is brought from the breeding grounds and transmitted to conspecifics during subsequent staging during migration, and so a better understanding of the natal origin of staging ducks is vital to deciphering the dynamics of viral movement pathways. Ottenby is an important stopover site in southeast Sweden almost halfway downstream in the major Northwest European flyway, and is used by millions of waterfowl each year. Here, mallards were captured and sampled for influenza A virus infection, and positive samples were subtyped in order to study possible links to the natal area, which were determined by a novel approach combining banding recovery data and isotopic measurements (delta(2)H) of feathers grown on breeding grounds. Geographic assignments showed that the core natal areas of studied mallards were in Estonia, southern and central Finland, and northwestern Russia. This study demonstrates a clear temporal succession of latitudes of natal origin during the course of autumn migration. We also demonstrate a corresponding and concomitant shift in virus subtypes. Acknowledging that these two different patterns were based in part upon different data, a likely interpretation worth further testing is that the early arriving birds with more proximate origins have different influenza A subtypes than the more distantly originating late autumn birds. If true, this knowledge would allow novel insight into the origins and transmission of the influenza A virus among migratory hosts previously unavailable through conventional approaches.
513	22527004	Total and organic mercury in liver, kidney and muscle of waterbirds from wetlands of the Caspian Sea, Iran.	Aazami J, Esmaili-Saria A, Bahramifar N, Savabieasfahani M	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	 2012 Jul;89(1):96-101	 doi: 101007/s00128-012-0653-4 Epub 2012 Apr 22	We measured and compared total and organic mercury in liver, kidney, and muscle of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and coot (Fulica atra) from the Caspian Sea wetlands in Iran. For the Great Cormorant organic mercury in liver, kidney and muscle comprised 82 %, 79 % and 58 % of total mercury. In the mallard same values were 46 %, 54 %, and 64 %. For coot total mercury was: 0.1 +/- 0.0, 0.1 +/- 0.01, 0.03 +/- 0.01 in liver kidney and muscle respectively. We detected no organic mercury. In general older birds that feed on higher trophic levels can accumulate more mercury in their tissues.
514	22481893	Molecular cloning and in silico analysis of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) MEF2A gene cDNA and its expression profile in muscle tissues during fetal development.	Liu H, Wang J, Si J, Jia J, Li L, Han C, Huang K, He H, Xu F	Genet Mol Biol	 2012 Jan;35(1):182-90	 doi: 101590/s1415-47572012005000023 Epub 2012 Feb 16	The role of myogenic enhancer transcription factor 2a (MEF2A) in avian muscle during fetal development is unknown. In this work, we cloned the duck MEF2A cDNA sequence (GenBank accession no. HM460752) and examined its developmental expression profiles in cardiac muscle, non-vascular smooth muscle and skeletal muscle. Duck MEF2A cDNA comprised 1479 bp encoding 492 amino acid residues. In silico analysis showed that MEF2A contained MADS (MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS and SRF - serum response factor), MEF2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) transcription domains with high homology to related proteins in other species. Modified sites in these domains were conserved among species and several variants were found. Quantitative PCR showed that MEF2A was expressed in all three muscles at each developmental stage examined, with the expression in smooth muscle being higher than in the other muscles. These results indicate that the conserved domains of duck MEF2A, including the MADS and MEF2 domains, are important for MEF2A transcription factor function. The expression of MEF2A in duck smooth muscle and cardiac muscle suggests that MEF2A plays a role in these two tissues.
515	22442675	Transient expression of hemagglutinin antigen from low pathogenic avian influenza A (H7N7) in Nicotiana benthamiana.	Kanagarajan S, Tolf C, Lundgren A, Waldenstrom J, Brodelius PE	PLoS One	 2012;7(3):e33010	 doi: 101371/journalpone0033010 Epub 2012 Mar 19	The influenza A virus is of global concern for the poultry industry, especially the H5 and H7 subtypes as they have the potential to become highly pathogenic for poultry. In this study, the hemagglutinin (HA) of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H7N7 subtype isolated from a Swedish mallard Anas platyrhynchos was sequenced, characterized and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Recently, plant expression systems have gained interest as an alternative for the production of vaccine antigens. To examine the possibility of expressing the HA protein in N. benthamiana, a cDNA fragment encoding the HA gene was synthesized de novo, modified with a Kozak sequence, a PR1a signal peptide, a C-terminal hexahistidine (6xHis) tag, and an endoplasmic retention signal (SEKDEL). The construct was cloned into a Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV)-based vector (pEAQ-HT) and the resulting pEAQ-HT-HA plasmid, along with a vector (pJL3:p19) containing the viral gene-silencing suppressor p19 from Tomato bushy stunt virus, was agro-infiltrated into N. benthamiana. The highest gene expression of recombinant plant-produced, uncleaved HA (rHA0), as measured by quantitative real-time PCR was detected at 6 days post infiltration (dpi). Guided by the gene expression profile, rHA0 protein was extracted at 6 dpi and subsequently purified utilizing the 6xHis tag and immobilized metal ion adsorption chromatography. The yield was 0.2 g purified protein per kg fresh weight of leaves. Further molecular characterizations showed that the purified rHA0 protein was N-glycosylated and its identity confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, the purified rHA0 exhibited hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition activity indicating that the rHA0 shares structural and functional properties with native HA protein of H7 influenza virus. Our results indicate that rHA0 maintained its native antigenicity and specificity, providing a good source of vaccine antigen to induce immune response in poultry species.
516	22427851	An alternative theoretical approach to escape decision-making: the role of visual cues.	Javurkova V, Sizling AL, Kreisinger J, Albrecht T	PLoS One	 2012;7(3):e32522	 doi: 101371/journalpone0032522 Epub 2012 Mar 12	Escape enables prey to avoid an approaching predator. The escape decision-making process has traditionally been interpreted using theoretical models that consider ultimate explanations based on the cost/benefit paradigm. Ultimate approaches, however, suffer from inseparable extra-assumptions due to an inability to accurately parameterize the model's variables and their interactive relationships. In this study, we propose a mathematical model that uses intensity of predator-mediated visual stimuli as a basic cue for the escape response. We consider looming stimuli (i.e. expanding retinal image of the moving predator) as a cue to flight initiation distance (FID; distance at which escape begins) of incubating Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We then examine the relationship between FID, vegetation cover and directness of predator trajectory, and fit the resultant model to experimental data. As predicted by the model, vegetation concealment and directness of predator trajectory interact, with FID decreasing with increased concealment during a direct approach toward prey, but not during a tangential approach. Thus, we show that a simple proximate expectation, which involves only visual processing of a moving predator, may explain interactive effects of environmental and predator-induced variables on an escape response. We assume that our proximate approach, which offers a plausible and parsimonious explanation for variation in FID, may serve as an evolutionary background for traditional, ultimate explanations and should be incorporated into interpretation of escape behavior.
517	22419480	Vector activity and propagule size affect dispersal potential by vertebrates.	van Leeuwen CH, Tollenaar ML, Klaassen M	Oecologia	 2012 Sep;170(1):101-9	 doi: 101007/s00442-012-2293-0 Epub 2012 Mar 15	Many small organisms in various life stages can be transported in the digestive system of larger vertebrates, a process known as endozoochory. Potential dispersal distances of these "propagules" are generally calculated after monitoring retrieval in experiments with resting vector animals. We argue that vectors in natural situations will be actively moving during effective transport rather than resting. We here test for the first time how physical activity of a vector animal might affect its dispersal efficiency. We compared digestive characteristics between swimming, wading (i.e. resting in water) and isolation (i.e. resting in a cage) mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We fed plastic markers and aquatic gastropods, and monitored retrieval and survival of these propagules in the droppings over 24 h. Over a period of 5 h of swimming, mallards excreted 1.5 times more markers than when wading and 2.3 times more markers than isolation birds, the pattern being reversed over the subsequent period of monitoring where all birds were resting. Retention times of markers were shortened for approximately 1 h for swimming, and 0.5 h for wading birds. Shorter retention times imply higher survival of propagules at increased vector activity. However, digestive intensity measured directly by retrieval of snail shells was not a straightforward function of level of activity. Increased marker size had a negative effect on discharge rate. Our experiment indicates that previous estimates of propagule dispersal distances based on resting animals are overestimated, while propagule survival seems underestimated. These findings have implications for the dispersal of invasive species, meta-population structures and long distance colonization events.
518	22403642	Experimental quantification of long distance dispersal potential of aquatic snails in the gut of migratory birds.	van Leeuwen CH, van der Velde G, van Lith B, Klaassen M	PLoS One	 2012;7(3):e32292	 doi: 101371/journalpone0032292 Epub 2012 Mar 5	Many plant seeds and invertebrates can survive passage through the digestive system of birds, which may lead to long distance dispersal (endozoochory) in case of prolonged retention by moving vectors. Endozoochorous dispersal by waterbirds has nowadays been documented for many aquatic plant seeds, algae and dormant life stages of aquatic invertebrates. Anecdotal information indicates that endozoochory is also possible for fully functional, active aquatic organisms, a phenomenon that we here address experimentally using aquatic snails. We fed four species of aquatic snails to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and monitored snail retrieval and survival over time. One of the snail species tested was found to survive passage through the digestive tract of mallards as fully functional adults. Hydrobia (Peringia) ulvae survived up to five hours in the digestive tract. This suggests a maximum potential transport distance of up to 300 km may be possible if these snails are taken by flying birds, although the actual dispersal distance greatly depends on additional factors such as the behavior of the vectors. We put forward that more organisms that acquired traits for survival in stochastic environments such as wetlands, but not specifically adapted for endozoochory, may be sufficiently equipped to successfully pass a bird's digestive system. This may be explained by a digestive trade-off in birds, which maximize their net energy intake rate rather than digestive efficiency, since higher efficiency comes with the cost of prolonged retention times and hence reduces food intake. The resulting lower digestive efficiency allows species like aquatic snails, and potentially other fully functional organisms without obvious dispersal adaptations, to be transported internally. Adopting this view, endozoochorous dispersal may be more common than up to now thought.
519	22326660	Intracoelomic teratoma in a domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus): a case report including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.	Palmieri C, Romanucci M, Loi P, Della Salda L	Res Vet Sci	 2012 Oct;93(2):862-4	 doi: 101016/jrvsc201201009 Epub 2012 Feb 11	A female domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) suddenly died with abdominal distension and a large multilobulated mass within the coelomic cavity was found. Histologically and immunohistochemically, a benign mature tridermic teratoma was diagnosed and epithelial structures, cartilage, bone, myxoid tissue, adipocytes, muscle cells, cystic spaces lined by squamous epithelium, feather follicles, melanocytes and variable neural and glial differentiation were recognized. By electron microscopy, desmosomes, keratin bundles, dense core neurosecretory granules, aberrant Z-line material and Luse bodies were found. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tridermic benign intracoelomic teratoma of a duck in which an extensive immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examination has been performed and in which a common neural and glial differentiation has been demonstrated.
520	22323500	Escherichia coli with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in great cormorants and mallards in Central Europe.	Tausova D, Dolejska M, Cizek A, Hanusova L, Hrusakova J, Svoboda O, Camlik G, Literak I	J Antimicrob Chemother	 2012 May;67(5):1103-7	 doi: 101093/jac/dks017 Epub 2012 Feb 9	OBJECTIVES: Faecal Escherichia coli strains were isolated from great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), which are commonly occurring waterbirds in Europe, and studied for resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. METHODS: Cloacal swabs or faeces from great cormorants and mallards in Central Europe were cultivated to isolate Escherichia coli strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. RESULTS: Ten ESBL-producing E. coli with the bla(CTX-M-15) or bla(CTX-M-27) gene were isolated from eight great cormorants (1.6%, n = 499). The bla(CTX-M) genes were harboured by plasmids of F and I1 incompatibility groups. CTX-M-27-producing isolates were identified as the epidemiologically important B2-O25b-ST131 clone. No ESBL-producing E. coli was isolated from 305 mallards. Eight E. coli isolates with PMQR genes [six aac(6')-Ib-cr and two qnrS1] were detected in six great cormorants (1.2%). Seventeen strains with qnrS1 were detected in 17 mallards (6%). The PMQR genes were located on plasmids of incompatibility groups F, N or X2. ESBL and PMQR genes were found on conjugative plasmids, enabling the horizontal spread of resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Both great cormorants and mallards can spread epidemiologically important antimicrobial-resistant E. coli isolates to water bodies throughout Europe.
521	22312989	Evaluation of Nobuto filter paper strips for the detection of avian influenza virus antibody in waterfowl.	Dusek RJ, Hall JS, Nashold SW, TeSlaa JL, Ip HS	Avian Dis	 2011 Dec;55(4):674-6	 doi: 101637/9687-021511-ResNote1	The utility of using Nobuto paper strips for the detection of avian influenza antibodies was examined in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) experimentally infected with low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Blood was collected 2 wk after infection and was preserved either as serum or whole blood absorbed onto Nobuto strips. Analysis of samples using a commercially available blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed comparable results (> or = 96% sensitivity for all methods) between sera stored at -30 C and the Nobuto strip preservation method even when the Nobuto strips were stored up to 3 mo at room temperature (RT). Significant differences were detected in the ratio of sample absorbance to negative control absorbance for Nobuto strips stored at RT compared with sera stored at -30 C, although these differences did not affect the ability of the test to reliably detect positive and negative samples. Nobuto strips are a convenient and sensitive alternative to the collection of serum samples when maintaining appropriate storage temperatures is difficult.
522	22221240	Effects of sex and inclusion of dried distillers grains with solubles on slaughter yield and meat characteristics of Pekin ducks.	Adamski MP, Kowalczyk AM, Lukaszewicz ET, Korzeniowska M	Br Poult Sci	 2011 Dec;52(6):742-9	 doi: 101080/000716682011639745	1. The effects of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) dietary inclusion concentration, and sex, on body weight, slaughter efficiency and meat characteristics of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica, strain P55) were studied. 2. Sexed ducklings (n = 160) were divided randomly into 4 groups (each with 4 replicates). From d 1 to d 21, all the birds received the same commercial feed, then from 22 to 49 d of age the ducks were fed in the following groups: control (commercial feed) and three experimental groups (15%, 25% and 30% inclusion of DDGS). All ducks were weighed individually at d 1, 21 and 49. On the day of slaughter, 5 males and 5 females, of body weight close to the average weight for group and sex, were selected from each group, slaughtered and the following parameters were evaluated: slaughter yield, weight, and percentage of particular elements of carcase, physical and chemical characteristics of meat. 3. The results obtained showed that DDGS included from 22 to 49 d of rearing, at concentrations up to 30%, in a commercial Pekin duck diet did not affect the live body weight, slaughter yield, weight, and percentage of breast and leg muscle, skin with subcutaneous fat, and abdominal fat. There were no differences in physical characteristics (pH(15), pH(24,) meat colour values L*, a*and b*, and hygroscopicity) of breast muscle, as well as in cholesterol content. DDGS addition at 30% significantly increased fat content in male, and crude protein in female, breast meat. Sex effect was observed only in a few traits and was diet dependent. Final body weight of females fed 30% DDGS was significantly lower than males; in the control and 15% DDGS group females had higher percentage of skin with subcutaneous fat. 4. The results obtained, and relative costs of feeds produced, allows the recommendation of DDGS addition at up to 30% to commercial Pekin duck diets from 22 d of age.
523	22211771	Ultrastructure of the spermatozoa of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos sp.).	Simoes K, Orsi AM, Artoni SM	Anat Histol Embryol	 2012 Jun;41(3):202-8	 doi: 101111/j1439-0264201101124x Epub 2012 Jan 3	The ultrastructure of the spermatozoa of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos sp.) was analysed by transmission and scanning electron microscopies and compared with the results obtained in preliminary studies involving other non-passerine birds. The spermatozoa were characterised by the presence of a short head, short midpiece and long principal piece. The head consisted of a reduced acrosome that contained moderately electron-dense homogenous material. The implantation fossa was observed between the base of the nucleus and the proximal centriole. The midpiece contained electron-dense material associated with the proximal centriole and nuclear membrane, and a long distal centriole surrounded throughout its length by 11-12 elliptical mitochondria. A dense annulus separating the midpiece from the principal piece was visible. Posterior to the annulus, the axoneme was formed surrounded by a dense fibrous sheath, representing the principal piece or flagellum, which was a long segment with a smooth surface and a smaller diameter than the midpiece. The spermatozoon of the domestic duck resembles that of other non-passerine birds, corresponding to a basic type of spermatozoon similar to that of reptiles, called sauropsid type.
524	22201802	The eggshell: structure, composition and mineralization.	Hincke MT, Nys Y, Gautron J, Mann K, Rodriguez-Navarro AB, McKee MD	Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)	 2012 Jan 1;17(4):1266-80	 doi: 102741/3985	The calcareous egg is produced by all birds and most reptiles. Current understanding of eggshell formation and mineralization is mainly based on intensive studies of one species - the domesticated chicken Gallus gallus. The majority of constituents of the chicken eggshell have been identified. In this article we review eggshell microstructure and ultrastructure, and the results of recent genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the chicken eggshell matrix to draw attention to areas of current uncertainty such as the potential role of amorphous calcium carbonate and the specific nature of the molecules that initiate (nucleate) mammillary cone formation and terminate palisade layer calcification. Comparative avian genomics and proteomics have only recently become possible with the publication of the Taeniopygia guttata (zebra finch) genome. Further rapid progress is highly anticipated with the soon-to-be-released genomes of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos). These resources will allow rapid advances in comparative studies of the organic constituents of avian eggshell and their functional implications.
525	22184444	Production of donor-derived offspring after ovarian transplantation between Muscovy (Cairina moschata) and Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos) ducks.	Song Y, Cheng KM, Robertson MC, Silversides FG	Poult Sci	 2012 Jan;91(1):197-200	 doi: 103382/ps2011-01672	Transplantation of ovarian tissue between different breeds of chickens or Japanese quail can result in normal egg production and give rise to donor-derived offspring with a high frequency. The feasibility of interspecific ovarian transplantation was evaluated by transplanting ovarian tissue from Muscovy ducks to Pekin ducks just after hatch, with subsequent treatment of the recipients with an immunosuppressant. Among the 8 mature Pekin ducks that had received ovarian tissue from Muscovy ducklings, 2 produced fertile eggs when mated with Muscovy drakes, and one of these produced only Muscovy ducks, which were derived from the transplanted Muscovy ovary. The other produced mule ducks that were hybrids of the host Pekin duck and the Muscovy drake. Further development of interspecific transplantation of ovaries may provide a simple method for the conservation and propagation of endangered birds.
526	22177482	Metal levels in livers of waterfowl from Korea.	Kim J, Oh JM	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	 2012 Apr;78:162-9	 doi: 101016/jecoenv201111021 Epub 2011 Dec 16	This study presents concentrations of heavy metals (iron, zinc, manganese, copper, lead and cadmium) in livers of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), eurasian wigeons (Anas penelope), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and spot-billed ducks (Anas poecilorhyncha) from Korea in February 2006 and 2008. Iron concentrations were significantly lower in spot-billed ducks than in other species (ANOVA, p<0.001). Zinc concentrations were greater in white-fronted geese and spot-billed ducks than in eurasian wigeons and mallards (ANOVA, p<0.001). Manganese and copper concentrations in white-fronted geese were significantly higher than in other species (ANOVA, p<0.001). Cadmium concentrations were significantly higher in mallards and spot-billed ducks than in white-fronted geese (ANOVA, p=0.007). However, lead concentrations did not differ among species. Iron, zinc, manganese and copper concentrations from this study were within the range of other waterfowl studies. Therefore, we suggest that essential elements such as iron, zinc, manganese and copper are within normal range and are maintained there by normal homeostatic mechanism. Twenty individuals (29.0 percent) exceeded the threshold level for abnormal lead exposure (5 mug/g dry weight) in waterfowl in this study and it is a higher proportion than in herons, egrets and owls from Korea. We suggest that the result was attributed to ingestion of lead shot and sinkers. However, cadmium concentrations in waterfowl except one specimen were within the background concentrations for wild birds. In livers of four waterfowl species found in Korea, lead and cadmium concentrations were similar to previously reported in other geese and ducks; except for poisoning of lead shot or sinkers as shown in earlier studies.
527	22164198	Campylobacter populations in wild and domesticated Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Colles FM, Ali JS, Sheppard SK, McCarthy ND, Maiden MC	Environ Microbiol Rep	 2011 Oct;3(5):574-580	 doi: 101111/j1758-2229201100265x	Identifying the Campylobacter genotypes that colonize farmed and wild ducks will help to assess the proportion of human disease that is potentially attributable to the consumption of duck meat and environmental exposure to duck faeces. Comparison of temporally and geographically matched farmed and wild ducks showed that they had different Campylobacter populations in terms of: (i) prevalence, (ii) Campylobacter species and (iii) diversity of genotypes. Furthermore, 92.4% of Campylobacter isolates from farmed ducks were sequence types (STs) commonly associated with human disease, in contrast to just one isolate from the wild ducks. Only one ST, ST-45, was shared between the two sources, accounting for 0.9% of wild duck isolates and 5% of farmed duck isolates. These results indicate that domestic 'niche' as well as host type may affect the distribution of Campylobacter, and that husbandry practises associated with intensive agriculture may be involved in generating a reservoir of human disease associated lineages.
528	22146993	Morphological features of the nasal blood fluke Trichobilharzia regenti (Schistosomatidae, Digenea) from naturally infected hosts.	Skirnisson K, Kolarova L, Horak P, Ferte H, Jouet D	Parasitol Res	 2012 May;110(5):1881-92	 doi: 101007/s00436-011-2713-9 Epub 2011 Dec 7	The first author detected the nasal bird schistosome Trichobilharzia regenti in Iceland in Anas platyrhynchos in Landmannalaugar in autumn of 2003. Since then, measurements and morphological studies have been performed on fresh worms (fragments) obtained in the area from naturally infected ducks, A. platyrhynchos and Aythya marila. In the present study, we compare our findings to the original description of T. regenti by Horak et al. (Parasite 5:349-357, 1998) that relies upon worms obtained by experimental infections of A. platyrhynchos f. domestica and Cairina moschata f. domestica ducklings. Fragments obtained from naturally infected birds are markedly larger than those obtained in the experimental infection. Also, indistinct sex-related size difference was confirmed; males were more abundant in the material than females. Previously unknown morphological features detected in the present study include, e.g. subterminal spines on the oral sucker directed to the oral opening, spine pattern on the apical part of acetabulum and long tegumental spines (up to 16 mum) in the gonad and tail regions of both sexes. In males, we evaluated for the first time the morphology of the cirrus sac enclosing ejaculatory duct, prostata and the entire prostatic region, the course of vas deferens and the position of genital papilla. In females, the posterior part of the reproductive system was studied for the first time. The presence of the Laurer's canal was confirmed and its course from the oviduct to the surface, where spermatozoa were noticed to leave the canal, was described.
529	22139676	Interactions between methylmercury and selenomethionine injected into mallard eggs.	Klimstra JD, Yee JL, Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Stebbins KR	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2012 Mar;31(3):579-84	 doi: 101002/etc1708 Epub 2012 Jan 13	Methylmercury chloride and seleno-L-methionine were injected separately or in combinations into mallard eggs (Anas platyrhynchos), and embryo mortality and teratogenic effects (deformities) were modeled using a logistic regression model. Methylmercury was injected at doses that resulted in concentrations of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 microg/g Hg in the egg on a wet weight basis and selenomethionine at doses that resulted in concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 microg/g Se in the egg, also on a wet weight basis. When selenomethionine and methylmercury were injected separately, hatching probability decreased in both cases. However, when methylmercury was injected at 1.6 microg/g in combination with selenomethionine at 0.2 microg/g, the presence of the methylmercury resulted in less embryo mortality than had been seen with 0.2 microg/g Se by itself, but it increased the number of deformed embryos and hatchlings. Selenomethionine appeared to be more embryotoxic than equivalent doses of methylmercury when injected into eggs, and both injected methylmercury and selenomethionine were more toxic to mallard embryos than when deposited naturally in the egg by the mother. The underlying mechanisms behind the interactions between methylmercury and selenomethionine and why methylmercury appeared to improve hatching probability of Se-dosed eggs yet increased deformities when the two compounds were combined are unclear. These findings warrant further studies to understand these mechanisms in both laboratory and field settings.
530	22122903	Serosurveillance for Japanese encephalitis virus in wild birds captured in Korea.	Yang DK, Oh YI, Kim HR, Lee YJ, Moon OK, Yoon H, Kim B, Lee KW, Song JY	J Vet Sci	 2011 Dec;12(4):373-7	 doi: 104142/jvs2011124373	Climate change induced by recent global warming may have a significant impact on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. For example, the distribution of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has expanded into new regions. We surveyed the levels of hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies against JEV (Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) in wild birds captured in Korea. Blood samples were collected from 1,316 wild birds including the following migratory birds: Oceanodroma castro (n = 4), Anas formosa (n = 7), Anas penelope (n = 20), Fulica atra (n = 30), Anas acuta (n = 89), Anas crecca (n = 154), Anas platyrhynchos (n = 214), Aix galericulata (n = 310), and Anas poecilorhyncha (n = 488). All were captured in 16 locations in several Korea provinces between April 2007 and December 2009. Out of the 1,316 serum samples tested, 1,141 (86.7%) were positive for JEV. Wild birds captured in 2009 had a higher seroprevalence of ant-JEV antibodies than those captured in 2007. Wild birds with an HI antibody titer of 1 : 1,280 or higher accounted for 21.2% (280/1,316) of the animals tested. These findings indicated that wild birds from the region examined in our study have been exposed to JEV and may pose a high risk for introducing a new JEV genotype into Korea.
531	22111627	Contribution of blastoderm cells to Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica)-Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) chimeras.	Gao J, Yuan F, Tang X, Han H, Sha J, Yuan J, Shao Y, Jin X, Liu H, Rui L, Li Z	Anim Sci J	 2011 Dec;82(6):729-34	 doi: 101111/j1740-0929201100905x Epub 2011 Jul 13	The purpose of this study was to produce quail-duck chimeras by transferring stage X blastoderm cells and to detect the distribution of donor cells in heterogeneous embryos using PCR. Four experimental groups were made by transferring different amounts of quail blastoderm cells into duck recipients. In early embryonic stages, donor cells labeled with PKH26 fluorescent dye were observed in the head, neural tube and gonads by fluorescent microscopy. A total of 194 duck recipient embryos were injected and 93 survived to hatch. The average hatching rate was 48% (93/194); the hatching rate showed a significant difference among all the groups (P < 0.05). Sixteen somatic chimeras were obtained, 10 of which had black feathers derived from the donor quail. The PCR results showed that donor cells were distributed in various tissues and organs of the phenotypic chimeras. This is the first report on producing Japanese quail-Peking duck chimeras by transferring quail blastoderm cells into the subgerminal cavity of the duck. This technique will provide a basis for the investigation of fertilization barriers in interspecies germline chimeras and will aid conservation of endangered wild birds.
532	22107096	Genetic characterization of low pathogenic H5N1 and co-circulating avian influenza viruses in wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in Belgium, 2008.	Van Borm S, Vangeluwe D, Steensels M, Poncin O, van den Berg T, Lambrecht B	Avian Pathol	 2011 Dec;40(6):613-28	 doi: 101080/030794572011621410	As part of a long-term wild bird monitoring programme, five different low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from wild mallards (subtypes H1N1, H4N6, H5N1, H5N3, and H10N7). A LP H5N1 and two co-circulating (same location, same time period) viruses were selected for full genome sequencing. An H1N1 (A/Anas platyrhynchos/Belgium/09-762/2008) and an H5N1 virus (A/Anas platyrhynchos/Belgium/09-762-P1/2008) were isolated on the same day in November 2008, then an H5N3 virus (A/Anas platyrhynchos/09-884/2008) 5 days later in December 2008. All genes of these co-circulating viruses shared common ancestors with recent (2001 to 2007) European wild waterfowl influenza viruses. The H5N1 virus shares genome segments with both the H1N1 (PB1, NA, M) and the H5N3 (PB2, HA) viruses, and all three viruses share the same NS sequence. A double infection with two different PA segments from H5N1 and from H5N3 could be observed for the H1N1 sample. The observed gene constellations resulted from multiple reassortment events between viruses circulating in wild birds in Eurasia. Several internal gene segments from these 2008 viruses and the N3 sequence from the H5N3 show homology with sequences from 2003 H7 outbreaks in Italy (LP) and the Netherlands (highly pathogenic). These data contribute to the growing sequence evidence of the dynamic nature of the avian influenza natural reservoir in Eurasia, and underline the importance of monitoring AIV in wild birds. Genetic information of potential hazard to commercial poultry continues to circulate in this reservoir, including H5 and H7 subtype viruses and genes related to previous AIV outbreaks.
533	22105827	Embryotoxicity of Corexit 9500 in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wooten KJ, Finch BE, Smith PN	Ecotoxicology	 2012 Apr;21(3):662-6	 doi: 101007/s10646-011-0822-y Epub 2011 Nov 22	Embryotoxicity of the oil dispersant Corexit 9500 was examined using fertilized mallard duck eggs. Corexit 9500 was topically applied below the air cell to eggs in volumes ranging from 0 to 100 muL on day 3 of incubation. The highest incidence of mortality occurred at developmental stage 4, one day post-Corexit 9500 application. Hatching success was significantly decreased among eggs treated with >/= 20 muL of Corexit 9500 as compared to controls (P </= 0.047). No egg treated with >/= 40 muL successfully hatched. The application volume resulting in 50% mortality (corrected for control survival) was determined to be 15.5 muL. Developmental stage at embryo death was also significantly decreased compared to controls in eggs exposed to 40 muL (P = 0.0042) and above.
534	22093799	Evolution and connectivity in the world-wide migration system of the mallard: inferences from mitochondrial DNA.	Kraus RH, Zeddeman A, van Hooft P, Sartakov D, Soloviev SA, Ydenberg RC, Prins HH	BMC Genet	 2011 Nov 17;12:99	 doi: 101186/1471-2156-12-99	BACKGROUND: Main waterfowl migration systems are well understood through ringing activities. However, in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) ringing studies suggest deviations from general migratory trends and traditions in waterfowl. Furthermore, surprisingly little is known about the population genetic structure of mallards, and studying it may yield insight into the spread of diseases such as Avian Influenza, and in management and conservation of wetlands. The study of evolution of genetic diversity and subsequent partitioning thereof during the last glaciation adds to ongoing discussions on the general evolution of waterfowl populations and flyway evolution. Hypothesised mallard flyways are tested explicitly by analysing mitochondrial mallard DNA from the whole northern hemisphere. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses confirm two mitochondrial mallard clades. Genetic differentiation within Eurasia and North-America is low, on a continental scale, but large differences occur between these two land masses (F(ST) = 0.51). Half the genetic variance lies within sampling locations, and a negligible portion between currently recognised waterfowl flyways, within Eurasia and North-America. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) at continent scale, incorporating sampling localities as smallest units, also shows the absence of population structure on the flyway level. Finally, demographic modelling by coalescence simulation proposes a split between Eurasia and North-America 43,000 to 74,000 years ago and strong population growth (~100fold) since then and little migration (not statistically different from zero). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this first complete assessment of the mallard's world-wide population genetic structure we confirm that no more than two mtDNA clades exist. Clade A is characteristic for Eurasia, and clade B for North-America although some representatives of clade A are also found in North-America. We explain this pattern by evaluating competing hypotheses and conclude that a complex mix of historical, recent and anthropogenic factors shaped the current mallard populations. We refute population classification based on flyways proposed by ornithologists and managers, because they seem to have little biological meaning. Our results have implications for wetland management and conservation, with special regard to the release of farmed mallards for hunting, as well as for the possible transmission of Avian Influenza by mallards due to migration.
535	22042039	A comparison of the teratogenicity of methylmercury and selenomethionine injected into bird eggs.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2012 Apr;62(3):519-28	 doi: 101007/s00244-011-9717-4 Epub 2011 Nov 1	Methylmercury chloride and seleno-L-methionine were injected separately or in combinations into the fertile eggs of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), chickens (Gallus gallus), and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), and the incidence and types of teratogenic effects were recorded. For all three species, selenomethionine alone caused more deformities than did methylmercury alone. When mallard eggs were injected with the lowest dose of selenium (Se) alone (0.1 mug/g), 28 of 44 embryos and hatchlings were deformed, whereas when eggs were injected with the lowest dose of mercury (Hg) alone (0.2 mug/g), only 1 of 56 embryos or hatchlings was deformed. Mallard embryos seemed to be more sensitive to the teratogenic effects of Se than chicken embryos: 0 of 15 chicken embryos or hatchlings from eggs injected with 0.1 mug/g Se exhibited deformities. Sample sizes were small with double-crested cormorant eggs, but they also seemed to be less sensitive to the teratogenic effects of Se than mallard eggs. There were no obvious differences among species regarding Hg-induced deformities. Overall, few interactions were apparent between methylmercury and selenomethionine with respect to the types of deformities observed. However, the deformities spina bifida and craniorachischisis were observed only when Hg and Se were injected in combination. One paradoxical finding was that some doses of methylmercury seemed to counteract the negative effect selenomethionine had on hatching of eggs while at the same time enhancing the negative effect selenomethionine had on creating deformities. When either methylmercury or selenomethionine is injected into avian eggs, deformities start to occur at much lower concentrations than when the Hg or Se is deposited naturally in the egg by the mother.
536	22036527	Phenotypic and genetic diversity among intestinal spirochaetes (genus Brachyspira) in free-living wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled in southern Sweden.	Jansson DS, Persson M, Zimmerman U, Johansson KE	Syst Appl Microbiol	 2011 Dec;34(8):566-75	 doi: 101016/jsyapm201110001 Epub 2011 Oct 28	Brachyspira spp. are anaerobic intestinal spirochaetes that colonize vertebrates. Some species cause enteric diseases in pigs, chickens and possibly in humans, whereas others display a commensual relationship with their hosts. The aims were to investigate the prevalence among colonized free-living wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of three enteropathogenic Brachyspira spp., and to describe the biodiversity of Brachyspira spp. isolates. Isolates from 150 birds were screened by PCR for 3 pathogenic Brachyspira spp., and 35 isolates from 20 mallards, 4 pigs and 1 chicken were subjected to phenotypic tests, 9 diagnostic PCRs, sequencing of the 16S rRNA and NADH oxidase (nox) genes, phylogenetic analysis and nox gene restriction enzyme analysis in silico. Of the 150 birds, 47%, 33% and 11% were positive by PCR for Brachyspira pilosicoli, Brachyspira intermedia and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, respectively. Thirty-one characterized isolates were provisionally identified as B. intermedia, Brachyspira alvinipulli, "Brachyspira pulli", or B. pilosicoli, whereas 4 were of indeterminate species affiliation. Many isolates were phylogenetically related to isolates from livestock. Isolates identified by PCR as B. pilosicoli displayed particularly high biodiversity. Up to five different Brachyspira genotypes were found from the same bird. Sequencing of amplicons from isolates that displayed ambiguous results as judged from PCR and phenotyping showed that several diagnostic PCRs were non-specific. Nox gene restriction enzyme analysis in silico correctly identified 2 of 34 characterized isolates. A culture technique based on filtration that produced uncontaminated spirochaete isolates was described. The results show that mallard intestines support a high degree of biodiversity among Brachyspira spp.
537	22028909	Viral replication, persistence in water and genetic characterization of two influenza A viruses isolated from surface lake water.	Lebarbenchon C, Yang M, Keeler SP, Ramakrishnan MA, Brown JD, Stallknecht DE, Sreevatsan S	PLoS One	 2011;6(10):e26566	 doi: 101371/journalpone0026566 Epub 2011 Oct 20	Water-borne transmission has been suggested as an important transmission mechanism for Influenza A (IA) viruses in wild duck populations; however, relatively few studies have attempted to detect IA viruses from aquatic habitats. Water-isolated viruses have rarely been genetically characterized and evaluation for persistence in water and infectivity in natural hosts has never been documented. In this study, we focused on two IA viruses (H3N8 and H4N6 subtypes) isolated from surface lake water in Minnesota, USA. We investigated the relative prevalence of the two virus subtypes in wild duck populations at the sampling site and their genetic relatedness to IA viruses isolated in wild waterbirds in North America. Viral persistence under different laboratory conditions (temperature and pH) and replication in experimentally infected Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were also characterized. Both viruses were the most prevalent subtype one year following their isolation in lake water. The viruses persisted in water for an extended time period at constant temperature (several weeks) but infectivity rapidly reduced under multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, the two isolates efficiently replicated in Mallards. The complete genome characterization supported that these isolates originated from genetic reassortments with other IA viruses circulating in wild duck populations during the year of sampling. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we couldn't identify genetically similar viruses in duck populations in the years following their isolation from lake water. Our study supports the role for water-borne transmission for IA viruses but also highlights that additional field and experimental studies are required to support inter-annual persistence in aquatic habitats.
538	22028812	Effects of infection-induced migration delays on the epidemiology of avian influenza in wild mallard populations.	Galsworthy SJ, ten Bosch QA, Hoye BJ, Heesterbeek JA, Klaassen M, Klinkenberg D	PLoS One	 2011;6(10):e26118	 doi: 101371/journalpone0026118 Epub 2011 Oct 18	Wild waterfowl populations form a natural reservoir of Avian Influenza (AI) virus, and fears exist that these birds may contribute to an AI pandemic by spreading the virus along their migratory flyways. Observational studies suggest that individuals infected with AI virus may delay departure from migratory staging sites. Here, we explore the epidemiological dynamics of avian influenza virus in a migrating mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population with a specific view to understanding the role of infection-induced migration delays on the spread of virus strains of differing transmissibility. We develop a host-pathogen model that combines the transmission dynamics of influenza with the migration, reproduction and mortality of the host bird species. Our modeling predicts that delayed migration of individuals influences both the timing and size of outbreaks of AI virus. We find that (1) delayed migration leads to a lower total number of cases of infection each year than in the absence of migration delay, (2) when the transmission rate of a strain is high, the outbreak starts at the staging sites at which birds arrive in the early part of the fall migration, (3) when the transmission rate is low, infection predominantly occurs later in the season, which is further delayed when there is a migration delay. As such, the rise of more virulent AI strains in waterfowl could lead to a higher prevalence of infection later in the year, which could change the exposure risk for farmed poultry. A sensitivity analysis shows the importance of generation time and loss of immunity for the effect of migration delays. Thus, we demonstrate, in contrast to many current transmission risk models solely using empirical information on bird movements to assess the potential for transmission, that a consideration of infection-induced delays is critical to understanding the dynamics of AI infection along the entire flyway.
539	21995264	Cross-seasonal patterns of avian influenza virus in breeding and wintering migratory birds: a flyway perspective.	Hill NJ, Takekawa JY, Cardona CJ, Meixell BW, Ackerman JT, Runstadler JA, Boyce WM	Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis	 2012 Mar;12(3):243-53	 doi: 101089/vbz20100246 Epub 2011 Oct 13	The spread of avian influenza viruses (AIV) in nature is intrinsically linked with the movements of wild birds. Wild birds are the reservoirs for the virus and their migration may facilitate the circulation of AIV between breeding and wintering areas. This cycle of dispersal has become widely accepted; however, there are few AIV studies that present cross-seasonal information. A flyway perspective is critical for understanding how wild birds contribute to the persistence of AIV over large spatial and temporal scales, with implications for how to focus surveillance efforts and identify risks to public health. This study characterized spatio-temporal infection patterns in 10,389 waterfowl at two important locations within the Pacific Flyway--breeding sites in Interior Alaska and wintering sites in California's Central Valley during 2007-2009. Among the dabbling ducks sampled, the northern shoveler (Anas clypeata) had the highest prevalence of AIV at both breeding (32.2%) and wintering (5.2%) locations. This is in contrast to surveillance studies conducted in other flyways that have identified the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail (Anas acuta) as hosts with the highest prevalence. A higher diversity of AIV subtypes was apparent at wintering (n=42) compared with breeding sites (n=17), with evidence of mixed infections at both locations. Our study suggests that wintering sites may act as an important mixing bowl for transmission among waterfowl in a flyway, creating opportunities for the reassortment of the virus. Our findings shed light on how the dynamics of AIV infection of wild bird populations can vary between the two ends of a migratory flyway.
540	21978491	Identification and complete genome sequencing of paramyxoviruses in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) using random access amplification and next generation sequencing technologies.	Rosseel T, Lambrecht B, Vandenbussche F, van den Berg T, Van Borm S	Virol J	 2011 Oct 6;8:463	 doi: 101186/1743-422X-8-463	BACKGROUND: During a wildlife screening program for avian influenza A viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) in Belgium, we isolated two hemagglutinating agents from pools of cloacal swabs of wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) caught in a single sampling site at two different times. AIV and APMV1 were excluded using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing and specific real-time RT-PCR tests. METHODS: To refine the virological identification of APMV2-10 realized by HI subtyping tests and in lack of validated molecular tests for APMV2-10, random access amplification was used in combination with next generation sequencing for the sequence independent identification of the viruses and the determination of their genomes. RESULTS: Three different APMVs were identified. From one pooled sample, the complete genome sequence (15054 nucleotides) of an APMV4 was assembled from the random sequences. From the second pooled sample, the nearly complete genome sequence of an APMV6 (genome size of 16236 nucleotides) was determined, as well as a partial sequence for an APMV4. This APMV4 was closely related but not identical to the APMV4 isolated from the first sample. Although a cross-reactivity with other APMV subtypes did not allow formal identification, the HI subtyping revealed APMV4 and APMV6 in the respective pooled samples but failed to identify the co-infecting APMV4 in the APMV6 infected pool. CONCLUSIONS: These data further contribute to the knowledge about the genetic diversity within the serotypes APMV4 and 6, and confirm the limited sensitivity of the HI subtyping test. Moreover, this study demonstrates the value of a random access nucleic acid amplification method in combination with massive parallel sequencing. Using only a moderate and economical sequencing effort, the characterization and full genome sequencing of APMVs can be obtained, including the identification of viruses in mixed infections.
541	21964597	Interspecies transmission and limited persistence of low pathogenic avian influenza genomes among Alaska dabbling ducks.	Reeves AB, Pearce JM, Ramey AM, Meixell BW, Runstadler JA	Infect Genet Evol	 2011 Dec;11(8):2004-10	 doi: 101016/jmeegid201109011 Epub 2011 Sep 23	The reassortment and geographic distribution of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus genes are well documented, but little is known about the persistence of intact LPAI genomes among species and locations. To examine persistence of entire LPAI genome constellations in Alaska, we calculated the genetic identities among 161 full-genome LPAI viruses isolated across 4 years from five species of duck: northern pintail (Anas acuta), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), American green-winged teal (Anas crecca), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata) and American wigeon (Anas americana). Based on pairwise genetic distance, highly similar LPAI genomes (>99% identity) were observed within and between species and across a range of geographic distances (up to and >1000 km), but most often between isolates collected 0-10 km apart. Highly similar viruses were detected between years, suggesting inter-annual persistence, but these were rare in our data set with the majority occurring within 0-9 days of sampling. These results identify LPAI transmission pathways in the context of species, space and time, an initial perspective into the extent of regional virus distribution and persistence, and insight into why no completely Eurasian genomes have ever been detected in Alaska. Such information will be useful in forecasting the movement of foreign-origin avian influenza strains should they be introduced to North America.
542	21927945	Selenium accumulation and reproduction in birds breeding downstream of a uranium mill in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.	Weech SA, Scheuhammer AM, Wayland ME	Ecotoxicology	 2012 Jan;21(1):280-8	 doi: 101007/s10646-011-0788-9 Epub 2011 Sep 17	Selenium (Se) concentrations in aquatic invertebrates and bird eggs collected along the treated effluent receiving environment of the Key Lake uranium mill in northern Saskatchewan were significantly greater than from nearby reference areas, and in some cases (e.g., eggs of common loons--Gavia immer) were higher than commonly used thresholds for adverse reproductive effects in birds (i.e., 5 mug/g dry weight in diet; 12-15 mug/g dry weight in eggs). Mean Se concentrations in tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) eggs reached a maximum of 13.3 mug/g dry weight at the point of treated effluent discharge and exhibited a gradient of decreasing Se concentrations with increasing distance from the effluent discharge, probably reflecting both effluent dilution and local site fidelity by nesting swallows. In some cases, high intra-clutch variability in Se concentrations in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and tree swallow eggs was observed in high-Se sites, suggesting that a single egg randomly sampled from a nest in an area of higher Se exposure may not be representative of Se concentrations in other eggs from the same nest. Overall, tree swallow reproductive success was similar in both exposed and reference areas.
543	21908267	Comparison of two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for detection of Influenza A virus antibodies.	Lebarbenchon C, Brown JD, Luttrell MP, Stallknecht DE	J Vet Diagn Invest	 2012 Jan;24(1):161-5	 doi: 101177/1040638711416626 Epub 2011 Aug 19	Serologic tools for Influenza A virus (FLUAV) antibody testing of wild birds are currently limited. In the present study, 2 commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detection of FLUAV antibodies, the IDEXX AI MultiS-Screen Ab Test and the ID VET ID Screen Influenza A Antibody Competition, were compared. Sera obtained from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), experimentally infected with 8 FLUAV subtypes (N = 48), and field serum samples, collected from 11 wild bird species (N = 247), were tested. Overall, a substantial agreement was obtained between the 2 assays as applied to both experimental (86.5% agreement, kappa = 0.69) and field samples (89.9% agreement, kappa = 0.78). Based on the current study, doubtful results obtained with the ID VET assay should be re-tested to confirm their antibody status. Additionally, increasing the incubation period for the ID VET assay increases the test sensitivity but also increases the likelihood of generating false-positive results. Overall, it is concluded that the 2 ELISAs can be used for FLUAV antibody screening in wild birds and that the sensitivity of the ID VET assay can be increased with slight modifications of the manufacturer's instructions.
544	21888236	Community composition of aquatic birds in lakes of Bangalore, India.	Rajashekara S, Venkatesha MG	J Environ Biol	 2011 Jan;32(1):77-83		Observations were made on the occurrence, abundance, richness, and diversity of waterbirds in 15 major lakes in Bangalore city during 2008 - 2009. During the study period 35 species of aquatic birds were recorded. The number of aquatic bird species recorded at various lakes ranged from 23 to 35. The percent abundance of waterbirds recorded in the study lakes ranged from 2.46 to 21.49 and itwas significantly different (p < 0.05). The diversity and species evenness of waterbirds in the lakes ranged from 2.07 to 3.16 and 0.32 to 0.76, respectively. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the diversity and species evenness of waterbirds among different lakes. Species richness of the bird population ranged from 2.89 to 4.01 in the different study lakes and it was not significantly different (p > 0.05). There was a variation in number of waterbird species recorded during summer, monsoon and winter seasons. Of the 35 waterbird species, Bubulcus ibis showed cent percent frequency, whereas less frequently (4.44%) observed species was Anas platyrhynchos. Among various waterbird species, Bubulcus ibis, Fulica atra, Tringa hypoleucos, Motacilla maderaspatensis, Phalacrocorax niger Egretta garzetta, Charadrius dubius, Ardeola grayji, Halcyon smymensis and Motacilla alba were frequently encountered in most of the study lakes.
545	21857940	Influence of body condition on influenza A virus infection in mallard ducks: experimental infection data.	Arsnoe DM, Ip HS, Owen JC	PLoS One	 2011;6(8):e22633	 doi: 101371/journalpone0022633 Epub 2011 Aug 16	Migrating waterfowl are implicated in the global spread of influenza A viruses (IAVs), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are considered a particularly important IAV reservoir. Prevalence of IAV infection in waterfowl peaks during autumn pre-migration staging and then declines as birds reach wintering areas. Migration is energetically costly and birds often experience declines in body condition that may suppress immune function. We assessed how body condition affects susceptibility to infection, viral shedding and antibody production in wild-caught and captive-bred juvenile mallards challenged with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H5N9. Wild mallards (n = 30) were separated into three experimental groups; each manipulated through food availability to a different condition level (-20%, -10%, and normal +/-5% original body condition), and captive-bred mallards (n = 10) were maintained at normal condition. We found that wild mallards in normal condition were more susceptible to LPAIV infection, shed higher peak viral loads and shed viral RNA more frequently compared to birds in poor condition. Antibody production did not differ according to condition. We found that wild mallards did not differ from captive-bred mallards in viral intensity and duration of infection, but they did exhibit lower antibody titers and greater variation in viral load. Our findings suggest that reduced body condition negatively influences waterfowl host competence to LPAIV infection. This observation is contradictory to the recently proposed condition-dependent hypothesis, according to which birds in reduced condition would be more susceptible to IAV infection. The mechanisms responsible for reducing host competency among birds in poor condition remain unknown. Our research indicates body condition may influence the maintenance and spread of LPAIV by migrating waterfowl.
546	21856003	Three novel Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensins, upregulated by duck hepatitis virus, with antibacterial and antiviral activities.	Ma D, Lin L, Zhang K, Han Z, Shao Y, Liu X, Liu S	Mol Immunol	 2011 Oct;49(1-2):84-96	 doi: 101016/jmolimm201107019	Three novel Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensins (Apl_AvBDs), Apl_AvBD4, 7 and 12, were identified successfully and characterized in tissues from Peking ducks in the present study. The cDNA fragment of Apl_AvBD4 contained 171 bp, and encoded 56 amino acids. The complete nucleotide sequences of Apl_AvBD7 and 12 contained 204 bp and 198 bp open reading frames, which encoded 67 and 65 amino acids, respectively. Both recombinant and synthetic forms of the three Apl_AvBDs showed antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, except for Salmonella choleraesuis. In addition, the antibacterial activity of all the three Apl_AvBDs decreased significantly in 150 mM NaCl. Significant antiviral activity of the three Apl_AvBDs was shown against duck hepatitis virus (DHV). However, none of the Apl_AvBDs showed significant hemolytic activity. Additionally, the expressions of the three Apl_AvBDs in response to DHV infection was highly variable, and significant upregulation of Apl_AvBD7 in liver was found in response to infection at different time points. Expression of Apl_AvBD4 in thymus, and of Apl_AvBD7 in bone marrow was induced in a time-dependent fashion by DHV infection. In contrast, expression of Apl_AvBD12 was found to be significantly decreased, and was hard to detect in cecal tonsil, spleen, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus of ducks at some time points after DHV infection. The present results demonstrate that Apl_AvBDs play vital roles in the immune response of ducks against bacterial and viral pathogens.

548	21819592	Cloning and expression profiling of the VLDLR gene associated with egg performance in duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wang C, Li SJ, Yu WH, Xin QW, Li C, Feng YP, Peng XL, Gong YZ	Genet Sel Evol	 2011 Aug 5;43:29	 doi: 101186/1297-9686-43-29	BACKGROUND: The very low density lipoprotein receptor gene (VLDLR), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family, plays a crucial role in the synthesis of yolk protein precursors in oviparous species. Differential splicing of this gene has been reported in human, rabbit and rat. In chicken, studies showed that the VLDLR protein on the oocyte surface mediates the uptake of yolk protein precursors into growing oocytes. However, information on the VLDLR gene in duck is still scarce. METHODS: Full-length duck VLDLR cDNA was obtained by comparative cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Tissue expression patterns were analysed by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Association between the different genotypes and egg performance traits was investigated with the general linear model (GLM) procedure of the SAS(R) software package. RESULTS: In duck, two VLDLR transcripts were identified, one transcript (variant-a) containing an O-linked sugar domain and the other (variant-b) not containing this sugar domain. These transcripts share ~70 to 90% identity with their counterparts in other species. A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences showed that duck VLDLR proteins were closely related with those of chicken and zebra finch. The two duck VLDLR transcripts are differentially expressed i.e. VLDLR-a is mainly expressed in muscle tissue and VLDLR-b in reproductive organs. We have localized the duck VLDLR gene on chromosome Z. An association analysis using two completely linked SNP sites (T/C at position 2025 bp of the ORF and G/A in intron 13) and records from two generations demonstrated that the duck VLDLR gene was significantly associated with egg production (P < 0.01), age of first egg (P < 0.01) and body weight of first egg (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Duck and chicken VLDLR genes probably perform similar function in the development of growing oocytes and deposition of yolk lipoprotein. Therefore, VLDLR could be a candidate gene for duck egg performance and be used as a genetic marker to improve egg performance in ducks.
549	21812718	Antimicrobial susceptibility of Brachyspira spp. isolated from commercial laying hens and free-living wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Jansson DS, Pringle M	Avian Pathol	 2011 Aug;40(4):387-93	 doi: 101080/030794572011588197	In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to tylosin, valnemulin, tiamulin, doxycycline, lincomycin and ampicillin was investigated by broth dilution in 48 Brachyspira spp. isolates from commercial laying hens (n=30) and free-living wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) (n=18). Presumed pathogens (Brachyspira alvinipulli, Brachyspira intermedia, Brachyspira pilosicoli), commensals (Brachyspira murdochii, Brachyspira innocens, "Brachyspira pulli"), and isolates of undetermined species affiliation were included. The laying hens had not been exposed to therapeutic levels of antimicrobials for at least 50 weeks before sampling, and low levels of environmental antimicrobial exposure were presumed in mallards. No isolates with decreased susceptibility to tylosin, valnemulin, tiamulin or doxycycline were found. Decreased susceptibility to lincomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration 16 microg/ml) was detected in two isolates (Brachyspira sp.) from laying hens. Five isolates showed decreased susceptibility to ampicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration 16 to >32 microg/ml), including two "B. pulli" and one B. alvinipulli from laying hens, and isolates of B. pilosicoli and "B. pulli" from mallards. Decreased susceptibility to ampicillin was associated with beta-lactamase activity in four isolates. A new variant of a class D beta-lactamase gene designated bla (oxa-192) was identified in a B. pilosicoli isolate of mallard origin. This is the first time the genetic basis for antimicrobial resistance is described in Brachyspira spp. from a free-living wild bird. Isolates displaying decreased susceptibility to ampicillin were accompanied by fully susceptible isolates of the same species or other genotypes within three laying hen flocks. This underlines the need for performing antimicrobial susceptibility tests on single clones/genotypes, and to analyse multiple isolates from the same flock.
550	21789252	Evidence of the trade-off between starvation and predation risks in ducks.	Zimmer C, Boos M, Poulin N, Gosler A, Petit O, Robin JP	PLoS One	 2011;6(7):e22352	 doi: 101371/journalpone0022352 Epub 2011 Jul 18	The theory of trade-off between starvation and predation risks predicts a decrease in body mass in order to improve flight performance when facing high predation risk. To date, this trade-off has mainly been validated in passerines, birds that store limited body reserves for short-term use. In the largest avian species in which the trade-off has been investigated (the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos), the slope of the relationship between mass and flight performance was steeper in proportion to lean body mass than in passerines. In order to verify whether the same case can be applied to other birds with large body reserves, we analyzed the response to this trade-off in two other duck species, the common teal (Anas crecca) and the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Predation risk was simulated by disturbing birds. Ducks within disturbed groups were compared to non-disturbed control birds. In disturbed groups, both species showed a much greater decrease in food intake and body mass during the period of simulated high risk than those observed in the control group. This loss of body mass allows reaching a more favourable wing loading and increases power for flight, hence enhancing flight performances and reducing predation risk. Moreover, body mass loss and power margin gain in both species were higher than in passerines, as observed in mallards. Our results suggest that the starvation-predation risk trade-off is one of the major life history traits underlying body mass adjustments, and these findings can be generalized to all birds facing predation. Additionally, the response magnitude seems to be influenced by the strategy of body reserve management.
551	21771626	Pekin and Muscovy ducks respond differently to vaccination with a H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) commercial inactivated vaccine.	Cagle C, To TL, Nguyen T, Wasilenko J, Adams SC, Cardona CJ, Spackman E, Suarez DL, Pantin-Jackwood MJ	Vaccine	 2011 Sep 2;29(38):6549-57	 doi: 101016/jvaccine201107004 Epub 2011 Jul 21	Domestic ducks are key intermediates in the transmission of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, and therefore are included in vaccination programs to control H5N1 HPAI. Although vaccination has proven effective in protecting ducks against disease, different species of domestic ducks appear to respond differently to vaccination, and shedding of the virus may still occur in clinically healthy vaccinated populations. In this study we compared the response to vaccination between two common domestic duck species, Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and Muscovy (Cairina moschata), which were vaccinated with a commercial inactivated vaccine using one of three different schedules in order to elicit protection to H5N1 HPAI before one month of age. Clear differences in responses to vaccination were observed; the Muscovy ducks developed lower viral antibody titers induced by the same vaccination as Pekin ducks and presented with higher morbidity and mortality after challenge with an H5N1 HPAI virus. When comparing the response to infection in non-vaccinated ducks, differences were also observed, with infected Muscovy ducks presenting a lower mean death time and more severe neurological signs than Pekin ducks. However Pekin ducks had significantly higher body temperatures and higher levels of nitric oxide in the blood at 2 days post challenge than Muscovy ducks, indicating possible differences in innate immune responses. Comparison of the expression of innate immune related genes in spleens of the non-vaccinated infected ducks showed differences including significantly higher levels of expression of RIG-I in Pekin ducks and of IL-6 in Muscovy ducks. Both duck species showed an up-regulation of IFNalpha and MHC-I expression, and a down-regulation of MHC-II. In conclusion, differences in response to infection and vaccination were observed between the two domestic duck species. This information should be taken into account when developing effective vaccination programs for controlling H5N1 HPAI in different species of ducks.

Huang HL, Cheng YS, Huang CW, Huang MC, Hsu WH	Anim Genet	 2011 Aug;42(4):421-7	 doi: 101111/j1365-2052201002161x Epub 2011 Jan 25	Transcriptome analysis using a cDNA microarray was performed to identify differentially expressed genes that are correlated with hatchability, and a new PCR-RFLP marker of high hatchability among the identified genes was observed. We used the cDNA microarray technique for gene expression profiling of the magnum epithelium of laying Tsaiya ducks, and several regulated genes associated with hatchability were found. The results of real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of ovomucoid in the magnum epithelium of animals in the low-hatchability group were significantly higher than the levels in the high-hatchability group (P < 0.05). Primers TovF1 and TovR1, designed according to the ovomucoid EST sequence, were used to amplify genomic DNA samples of different individual Tsaiya ducks, and sequence analysis of the amplified DNA products showed deletion among the ducks from the low-hatchability group. Primers TovF2 and TovR2 were used to perform PCR-RFLP analysis on the amplified DNA products to classify the ducks into +/+, +/- and -/- genotypes. The animals of +/+ and +/- genotypes were identified as having significantly higher hatchability than those of the -/- genotype (P < 0.05). In contrast, no differences were observed between genotypes in terms of fertility, duration of fertility, egg weight or total number of eggs. Our results indicated that a novel PCR-RFLP marker of high hatchability, an ovomucoid gene polymorphism, can be used as a genetic marker for marker-assisted selection to improve hatchability in Tsaiya ducks.
553	21728797	Timing of ossification in duck, quail, and zebra finch: intraspecific variation, heterochronies, and life history evolution.	Mitgutsch C, Wimmer C, Sanchez-Villagra MR, Hahnloser R, Schneider RA	Zoolog Sci	 2011 Jul;28(7):491-500	 doi: 102108/zsj28491	Skeletogenic heterochronies have gained much attention in comparative developmental biology. The temporal appearance of mineralized individual bones in a species - the species ossification sequence - is an excellent marker in this kind of study. Several publications describe interspecific variation, but only very few detail intraspecific variation. In this study, we describe and analyze the temporal order of ossification of skeletal elements in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, the Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, and the White Pekin duck, a domestic race of the mallard Anas platyrhynchos, and explore patterns of intraspecific variation in these events. The overall sequences were found to be conserved. In the duck, variability is present in the relative timing of ossification in the occipital, the basisphenoid and the otic regions of the skull and the phalanges in the postcranium. This variation appears generally in close temporal proximity. Comparison with previously published data shows differences in ossification sequence in the skull, the feet, and the pelvis in the duck, and especially the pelvis in the quail. This clearly documents variability among different breeds.
554	21719198	Serological survey and risk factors for Toxoplasma gondii in domestic ducks and geese in Lower Saxony, Germany.	Maksimov P, Buschtons S, Herrmann DC, Conraths FJ, Gorlich K, Tenter AM, Dubey JP, Nagel-Kohl U, Thoms B, Botcher L, Kuhne M, Schares G	Vet Parasitol	 2011 Dec 15;182(2-4):140-9	 doi: 101016/jvetpar201105049 Epub 2011 Jun 12	To obtain estimates for the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in ducks and geese in Germany, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were established based on affinity-purified T. gondii tachyzoite surface antigen 1 (TgSAG1) and used to examine duck and goose sera for T. gondii-specific antibodies. The results of 186 sera from 60 non-infected ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and 101 sera from 36 non-infected geese (Anser anser) as well as 72 sera from 11 ducks and 89 sera from 12 geese inoculated experimentally with T. gondii tachyzoites (intravenously) or oocysts (orally) and positive in a T. gondii immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) were used to select a cut-off value for the TgSAG1-ELISA. Sera obtained by serial bleeding of experimentally inoculated ducks and geese were tested to analyze the time course of anti-TgSAG1 antibodies after inoculation and to assess the sensitivity of the assays in comparison with IFAT. In ducks, IFAT titres and ELISA indices peaked 2 and 5 weeks p.i with tachyzoites, respectively. Only three of six geese inoculated with tachyzoites at the same time as the ducks elicited a low and non-permanent antibody response as detected by the IFAT. In the TgSAG1-ELISA, only a slight increase of the ELISA indices was observed in four of six tachyzoite-inoculated geese. By contrast, inoculation of ducks and geese with oocysts led to an increase in anti-TgSAG1 antibodies within 1 or 2 weeks, which were still detectable at the end of the observation period, i.e. 11 weeks p.i. Inoculation of three ducks and three geese with oocysts of Hammondia hammondi, a protozoon closely related to T. gondii, resulted in a transient seroconversion in ducks and geese as measured by IFAT or TgSAG1-ELISA. Using the newly established TgSAG1-ELISA, sera from naturally exposed ducks and geese sampled in the course of a monitoring program for avian influenza were examined for antibodies to T. gondii; 145/2534 (5.7%) of the ducks and 94/373 (25.2%) of the geese had antibodies against TgSAG1. Seropositive animals were detected on 20 of 61 duck and in 11 of 13 goose farms; the seroprevalences within positive submissions of single farms ranged from 2.2% to 78.6%. Farms keeping ducks or geese exclusively indoors had a significantly lower risk (odds ratio 0.05, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.3) of harboring serologically positive animals as compared with farms where the animals had access to an enclosure outside the barn.
555	21702059	Toxicity of methylmercury injected into eggs when dissolved in water versus corn oil.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR, Kondrad SL	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2011 Sep;30(9):2103-6	 doi: 101002/etc601 Epub 2011 Jul 7	In a previous study, the embryotoxicity of methylmercury dissolved in corn oil was compared among 26 species of birds. Corn oil is not soluble in the water-based matrix that constitutes the albumen of an egg. To determine whether the use of corn oil limited the usefulness of this earlier study, a comparison was made of the embryotoxicity of methylmercury dissolved in corn oil versus water. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs were injected with methylmercury chloride dissolved in corn oil or water to achieve concentrations of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 microg/g mercury in the egg on a wet weight basis. Hatching success at each dose of mercury was compared between the two solvents. For mallards, 16.4% of the eggs injected with 1.6 microg/g mercury dissolved in water hatched, which was statistically lower than the 37.6% hatch rate of eggs injected with 1.6 microg/g mercury dissolved in corn oil, but no differences in hatching success were observed between corn oil and water at any of the other doses. With chicken eggs, no significant differences occurred in percentage hatch of eggs between corn oil and water at any of the mercury doses. Methylmercury dissolved in corn oil seems to have a toxicity to avian embryos similar to that of does methylmercury dissolved in water. Consequently, the results from the earlier study that described the toxicity of methylmercury dissolved in corn oil to avian embryos were probably not compromised by the use of corn oil as a solvent.
556	21682282	Identifying sources of Pb exposure in waterbirds and effects on porphyrin metabolism using noninvasive fecal sampling.	Martinez-Haro M, Taggart MA, Martin-Doimeadios RR, Green AJ, Mateo R	Environ Sci Technol	 2011 Jul 15;45(14):6153-9	 doi: 101021/es2009242 Epub 2011 Jun 17	Waterbird feces (mainly mallard Anas platyrhynchos and coot Fulica atra) were collected from four wetlands in Southern Spain in the field or during capture (n = 558 and n = 59, respectively) to study lead (Pb) shot ingestion. Lead and aluminum (Al) concentrations along with Pb isotope signatures were used to identify sources of Pb exposure. The profile and concentrations of porphyrins and biliverdin in feces were used as biomarkers of toxicological effects. Feces with Pb concentrations >/= 34 mug/g d.w. showed higher Pb/Al ratios, together with lower (206)Pb/(207)Pb and (208)Pb/(207)Pb ratios, and higher (208)Pb/(206)Pb ratios, than feces with <34 mug/g d.w. Isotope signatures and Pb/Al ratios together indicated that Pb shot ingestion was the likely cause of the high Pb levels in some samples, whereas sediment ingestion was linked to lower/background levels. Coproporphyrin I and protoporphyrin IX were also higher in feces with Pb >/= 34 mug/g d.w., indicating measurable disruption in heme synthesis. Noninvasive fecal sampling permits study of the degree and source of Pb exposure and physiological effects, with low-effort and minimal disturbance to waterbirds.
557	21682099	Cloacotaenia megalops (Nitzsch in Creplin, 1829) (Cestoda, Hymenolepididae) in wild ducks in Western Pomerania, Poland.	Krolaczyk K, Kavetska KM, Kalisinska E, Nowak MR	Wiad Parazytol	 2011;57(2):123-6		Cloacotaenia megalops (Nitzsch in Creplin, 1892) is a polyxenic and cosmopolitan tapeworm from the family Hymenolepididae. Its generic name derives from their typical location (cloaca), and the typical final hosts which are birds typically associated with water and marsh environments: Anseriformes, Galliformes and Gruiformes. In Poland, the presence of C. megalops has been observed so far in 16 species of ducks from the Baltic coast, the Mazurian Lake District, Wielkopolsko-Kujawska Lowland, Mazovian Lowland, and Podlasie Lowland. In Western Pomerania, quantitative structure analyses were only carried out on Anas platyrhynchos, and therefore the aim of this study was the detailed analysis of environmental populations of C. megalops in wild ducks. The examined tapeworms were isolated from the digestive tract of 1005 wild ducks representing 17 species belonging to three different eco-tribes: Anatini (n=225), Aythyini (n=413) and Mergini (n=367), from northwestern Poland. During the Study 187 C. megalops were found in 89 birds (8.8% of examined ducks) belonging to 7 species: Anas crecca (common teal), A. querquedula (garganey), A. platyrhynchos (mallard) (Anatini); Aythyaferina (pochard), A. fuligula (tufted duck), A. marila (greater scaup) (Aythyini) and Bucephala clangula (goldeneye) (Mergini). The results show the differences in the quantitative structure of C. megalops among the examined species of ducks. The highest prevalence was found in mallard (18.6%) and the lowest in greater scaup (3.2%). The highest mean intensity was observed in greater scaup (4.0), and the lowest in garganey and common teal (1.0). Relative density was at a similar level in the tested birds. Based on the ratio of dominance, it was found that C. megalops is a rare species in the cestodofauna in the examined birds.
558	21679937	Lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, and arsenic levels in eggs, feathers, and tissues of Canada geese of the New Jersey Meadowlands.	Tsipoura N, Burger J, Newhouse M, Jeitner C, Gochfeld M, Mizrahi D	Environ Res	 2011 Aug;111(6):775-84	 doi: 101016/jenvres201105013 Epub 2011 Jun 15	The New Jersey Meadowlands are located within the heavily urbanized New York/New Jersey Harbor Estuary and have been subject to contamination due to effluent and runoff from industry, traffic, and homes along the Hackensack River and nearby waterways. These extensive wetlands, though heavily impacted by development and pollution, support a wide array of bird and other wildlife species. Persistent contaminants may pose threats to birds in these habitats, affecting reproduction, egg hatchability, nestling survival, and neurobehavioral development. Metals of concern in the Meadowlands include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. These metals were analyzed in eggs, feathers, muscle, and liver of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) breeding in four wetland sites. We sampled geese collected during control culling (n=26) and collected eggs from goose nests (n=34). Levels of arsenic were below the minimum quantification level (MQL) in most samples, and cadmium and mercury were low in all tissues sampled. Chromium levels were high in feather samples. Mercury levels in eggs of Canada geese, an almost exclusively herbivorous species, were lower (mean +/-SE 4.29+/-0.30mug/g wet weight) than in eggs of omnivorous mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and insectivorous red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris) from the Meadowlands, consistent with trophic level differences. However, lead levels were higher in the goose eggs (161+/-36.7ng/g) than in the other species. Geese also had higher levels of lead in feathers (1910+/-386ng/g) than those seen in Meadowlands passerines. By contrast, muscle and liver lead levels were within the range reported in waterfowl elsewhere, possibly a reflection of metal sequestration in eggs and feathers. Elevated lead levels may be the result of sediment ingestion or ingestion of lead shot and sinkers. Finally, lead levels in goose liver (249+/-44.7ng/g) and eggs (161+/-36.7ng/g) may pose a risk if consumed frequently by humans. Mill Creek, the site with the most documented prior contamination, had significantly elevated cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead in goose tissues.
559	21656778	Differences in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns of skeletal muscle myosin light chain isoforms between Bos taurus, Sus scrofa and selected poultry species.	Montowska M, Pospiech E	J Sci Food Agric	 2011 Oct;91(13):2449-56	 doi: 101002/jsfa4486 Epub 2011 Jun 8	BACKGROUND: In this study the interspecies differences in two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns of skeletal muscle myosin light chain (MLC) isoforms between Bos taurus (cattle), Sus scrofa (pig), Gallus gallus (chicken), Meleagris gallopavo (turkey), Anas platyrhynchos (duck) and Anser anser (goose) were characterised on the basis of specific properties of MLCs associated with their structure and mobility in gel. RESULTS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis separations revealed species-specific differences in the molecular weight and pI of individual MLC isoforms (MLC1f, MLC2f and MLC3f). In the case of closely related animal species such as goose and duck or turkey and chicken, significant differences occurred in MLC1f. For MLC2f, differences between cattle and turkey and between pig and chicken were around 1 and 0.3 kDa respectively. It appeared from the comparison of amino acid sequences that even MLCs with only 2% difference in sequences have different electrophoretic mobilities. CONCLUSION: Interspecies differences in skeletal MLC isoforms appeared between cattle, pig, chicken, turkey, duck and goose. The slight changes observed in the course of the aging process confirmed that these proteins are relatively little susceptible to proteolytic enzymes during meat aging.
560	21653809	Decreased hydrophobicity of iridescent feathers: a potential cost of shiny plumage.	Eliason CM, Shawkey MD	J Exp Biol	 2011 Jul 1;214(Pt 13):2157-63	 doi: 101242/jeb055822	Honest advertisement models posit that sexually selected traits are costly to produce, maintain or otherwise bear. Brightly coloured feathers are thought to be classic examples of these models, but evidence for a cost in feathers not coloured by carotenoid pigments is scarce. Unlike pigment-based colours, iridescent feather colours are produced by light scattering in modified feather barbules that are characteristically flattened and twisted towards the feather surface. These modifications increase light reflectance, but also expose more surface area for water adhesion, suggesting a potential trade-off between colour and hydrophobicity. Using light microscopy, spectrometry, contact angle goniometry and self-cleaning experiments, we show that iridescent feathers of mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, are less hydrophobic than adjacent non-iridescent feathers, and that this is primarily caused by differences in barbule microstructure. Furthermore, as a result of this decreased hydrophobicity, iridescent feathers are less efficient at self-cleaning than non-iridescent feathers. Together, these results suggest a previously unforeseen cost of iridescent plumage traits that may help to explain the evolution and distribution of iridescence in birds.
561	21653587	Ontogenetic immune challenges shape adult personality in mallard ducks.	Butler MW, Toomey MB, McGraw KJ, Rowe M	Proc Biol Sci	 2012 Jan 22;279(1727):326-33	 doi: 101098/rspb20110842 Epub 2011 Jun 8	Consistent individual differences in behaviour are widespread in animals, but the proximate mechanisms driving these differences remain largely unresolved. Parasitism and immune challenges are hypothesized to shape the expression of animal personality traits, but few studies have examined the influence of neonatal immune status on the development of adult personality. We examined how non-pathogenic immune challenges, administered at different stages of development, affected two common measures of personality, activity and exploratory behaviour, as well as colour-dependent novel object exploration in adult male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). We found that individuals that were immune-challenged during the middle (immediately following the completion of somatic growth) and late (during the acquisition of nuptial plumage) stages of development were more active in novel environments as adults relative to developmentally unchallenged birds or those challenged at an earlier developmental time point. Additionally, individuals challenged during the middle stage of development preferred orange and avoided red objects more than those that were not immune-challenged during development. Our results demonstrate that, in accordance with our predictions, early-life immune system perturbations alter the expression of personality traits later in life, emphasizing the role that developmental plasticity plays in shaping adult personality, and lending support to recent theoretical models that suggest that parasite pressure may play an important role in animal personality development.
562	21634232	Morphological features of Cloacotaenia megalops (Nitzsch in Creplin, 1829) (Cestoda, Hymenolepididae) from different hosts.	Nowak MR, Krolaczyk K, Kavetska KM, Pilarczyk B	Wiad Parazytol	 2011;57(1):31-6		The tapeworm species Cloacotaenia megalops (Nitzsch in Creplin, 1829) is characterized by a very specific morphology. A particularly distinct feature is a large almost square scolex in which four fleshy suction cups are embedded and a rudimentary rostellum. During standard studies of wild duck cestode fauna in northwestern Poland, some morphological differences were observed among specimens, mainly in the shape of scolices and hermaphroditic proglottids of C. megalops isolated from different bird species. This paper attempts to demonstrate the impact of the host species on morphology of the parasite. The study material consisted of 39 individuals of C. megalops (19 from Aythya fuligula, 10 from Anas platyrhynchos, 4 from Bucephala clangula, 4 from Aythya marila and 2 from A. ferina). The isolated parasites were fixed and stored in 70% ethanol and solid preparations were made. Selected external and internal structures of the parasite were measured and photographed using a Zeiss microscope, a microscope camera Opta Tech 2.1 and Opta View 6.0.2.2. It was stated that the sizes of the most important elements of the parasite morphology are generally consistent with those presented in the available literature, nevertheless some differences were observed in both morphology and sizes of some anatomical structures, especially in the form of scolices and hermaphroditic proglottids between specimens isolated from hosts representing three different eco-tribes (Aythyini, Anatini and Mergini).
563	21614608	Characterization of in vitro cultured myoblasts isolated from duck (Anas platyrhynchos) embryo.	Liu HH, Li L, Chen X, Cao W, Zhang RP, Yu HY, Xu F, He H, Wang JW	Cytotechnology	 2011 Aug;63(4):399-406	 doi: 101007/s10616-011-9356-7 Epub 2011 May 26	Myoblasts isolated from duck embryonic muscle were purified and in vitro cultured. External characteristics were observed by using the immunofluorescence technique, and growth curve of duck embryonic myoblasts was established after measuring with the MTT method. Moreover, mRNA expression of three marker genes, the Desmin, the muscle creatine kinase (Mck) and the troponin C (Tnnc), which could reflect the development status of myofibers, were detected each 24 h for cultured cells by using the qPCR technique. Results showed that the in vitro cultured duck myoblasts went through a series of developmental stages, including the proliferation of myoblasts, the differentiation of multi-nuclei myotubes, and the formation of myofiber. The cultured duck embryonic myoblasts entered into a logarithmic stage approximately on the fourth day after seeding. Accompanying with its progressive growth before entering into the logarithmic phase, the myoblasts also showed some differentiation phenomena, reflected by a low expression level of Desmin and high expression level of the Mck and Tnnc genes. During the rapid growth of the logarithmic phase, there was a high expression of the Desmin gene, and a low expression level of the Mck gene and the Tnnc gene in the cultured myoblasts. The expression profiles of the three marker genes for muscle development could be used for distinguishing the different developmental stages of in vitro cultured myoblasts at the molecular level, which would be more accurate and more feasible than observing the external characteristics of the cultured cells.
564	21613520	Kinematics of the quadrate bone during feeding in mallard ducks.	Dawson MM, Metzger KA, Baier DB, Brainerd EL	J Exp Biol	 2011 Jun 15;214(Pt 12):2036-46	 doi: 101242/jeb047159	Avian cranial kinesis, in which mobility of the quadrate, pterygoid and palatine bones contribute to upper bill elevation, is believed to occur in all extant birds. The most widely accepted model for upper bill elevation is that the quadrate rotates rostrally and medially towards the pterygoid, transferring force to the mobile pterygoid-palatine complex, which pushes on the upper bill. Until now, however, it has not been possible to test this hypothesis in vivo because quadrate motions are rapid, three-dimensionally complex and not visible externally. Here we use a new in vivo X-ray motion analysis technique, X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM), to create precise (+/-0.06 mm) 3-D animations of the quadrate, braincase, upper bill and mandible of three mallard ducks, Anas platyrhynchos. We defined a joint coordinate system (JCS) for the quadrato-squamosal joint with the axes aligned to the anatomical planes of the skull. In this coordinate system, the quadrate's 3-D rotations produce an elliptical path of pterygoid process motion, with medial and rostrodorsal then lateral and rostrodorsal motion as the upper bill elevates. As the upper bill depresses, the pterygoid process continues along the ellipsoidal path, with lateral and caudoventral then medial and caudoventral motion. We also found that the mandibular rami bow outwards (streptognathy) during mandibular depression, which may cause the lateral component of quadrate rotation that we observed. Relative to the JCS aligned with the anatomical planes of the skull, a second JCS aligned with quadrato-squamosal joint anatomy did not produce a simpler description of quadrate kinematics.
565	21612413	Prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in wild birds in Durango, Mexico.	Alvarado-Esquivel C, Rajendran C, Ferreira LR, Kwok OC, Choudhary S, Alvarado-Esquivel D, Rodriguez-Pena S, Villena I, Dubey JP	J Parasitol	 2011 Oct;97(5):809-12	 doi: 101645/GE-28441 Epub 2011 May 25	There is a lack of information concerning the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in wild birds in Mexico. In the present study, serum samples and tissues from 653 birds from Durango State, Mexico, were evaluated for T. gondii infection. Antibodies to T. gondii (modified agglutination test, titer 1ratio25 or higher) were found in 17 (2.6%) of the 653 birds, including 1 of 2 curve-billed thrashers (Toxostoma curvirostre), 2 (1 Anas platyrhynchos, 1 Anas diazi) of 4 ducks, 1 of 2 eagles (Aquila sp.), 5 (27.8%) of 18 great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus), 7 (1.3%) of 521 rock pigeons (Columba livia), and 1 (14.3%) of 7 quail (Coturnix coturnix). The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in birds captured in a park outside the city zoo (11.6%, 8/69) was significantly higher than that found in birds from other regions (1.5%, 9/584, OR = 8.38; 95% CI: 2.82-24.77; P = 0.0001). Brains and hearts of 23 birds (17 seropositive, 6 seronegative) were bioassayed in mice for the isolation of T. gondii . Viable T. gondii was isolated from 1 of 7 seropositive pigeons. The DNA obtained from the T. gondii isolate from the pigeon was genotyped using the PCR-RFLP typing using 11 markers (B1, SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, and Apico) and revealed an atypical genotype. This is the first report of T. gondii infection in great-tailed grackles, the Mexican duck, and curved-billed thrashers and the first survey of wild birds in Mexico.
566	21604054	Hormesis associated with a low dose of methylmercury injected into mallard eggs.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR, Kondrad SL, Erwin CA	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2012 Jan;62(1):141-4	 doi: 101007/s00244-011-9680-0 Epub 2011 May 21	We injected mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) eggs with methylmercury chloride at doses of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 mug mercury/g egg contents on a wet-weight basis. A case of hormesis seemed to occur because hatching success of eggs injected with 0.05 mug/g mercury (the lowest dose) was significantly greater (93.3%) than that of controls (72.6%), whereas hatching success decreased at progressively greater doses of mercury. Our finding of hormesis when a low dose of methylmercury was injected into eggs agrees with a similar observation in a study in which a group of female mallards was fed a low dietary concentration of methylmercury and hatching of their eggs was significantly better than that of controls. If methylmercury has a hormetic effect at low concentrations in avian eggs, these low concentrations may be important in a regulatory sense in that they may represent a no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL).
567	21597064	Body temperature responses of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) exposed to different pathogens.	Marais M, Gugushe N, Maloney SK, Gray DA	Poult Sci	 2011 Jun;90(6):1234-8	 doi: 103382/ps2011-01389	Poultry, like mammals and other birds, develop fever when exposed to compounds from gram-negative bacteria. Mammals also develop fever when exposed to the constituents of viruses or gram-positive bacteria, and the fevers stimulated by these different pathogenic classes have discrete characteristics. It is not known whether birds develop fever when infected by viruses or gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, we injected Pekin ducks with muramyl dipeptide, the cell walls of heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus, or the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid and monitored their body temperature (T(b)). For comparative purposes we also injected a group of ducks with lipopolysaccharide, the only known pyrogen in birds. We then compared the T(b) invoked by each injection with the T(b) after an injection of saline. Muramyl dipeptide did not affect T(b). The cell walls of heat-killed S. aureus invoked long-lasting, dose-dependent fevers with relatively low magnitudes. Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid invoked dose-dependent fevers with high febrile peaks. Fever is a well-known clinical sign of infection in mammals, and the results of this study indicate that the pattern of increase in T(b) could serve as an indicator for diverse pathogenic diseases in birds.
568	21560150	Embryotoxicity of weathered crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Finch BE, Wooten KJ, Smith PN	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2011 Aug;30(8):1885-91	 doi: 101002/etc576 Epub 2011 Jun 8	Weathered crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico can result from oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon incident that occurred on April 20, 2010 or from natural seeps. Adult waterbirds of the Gulf Coast region may become exposed to weathered crude oil while foraging, wading, or resting, and residues can then be transferred to nests, eggs, and hatchlings. Although the toxicity of many types of crude oil to avian embryos has been thoroughly studied, the effects of weathered crude oil on developing avian embryos are not well characterized. The objective of the present study was to examine embryotoxicity of weathered crude oil collected from the Gulf of Mexico in June 2010 using mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) as a model species. Weathered crude oil was applied to fertilized mallard duck eggs by paintbrush in masses ranging from 0.1 to 99.9 mg on day 3 of incubation. Mortality occurred as early as day 7 and the conservatively derived median lethal application of weathered crude oil was 30.8 mg/egg (0.5 mg/g egg) or 30.7 microl/egg (0.5 microl/g egg). Body mass, liver and spleen mass, crown-rump and bill lengths, and frequency of deformities were not significantly different among hatchlings from oiled and control eggs. In comparison to published reports of fresh crude oil embryotoxicity, weathered crude oil was considerably less toxic. We conclude that avian toxicity varies according to the degree of crude oil weathering and the stage of embryonic development at the time of exposure. Results indicate bird eggs exposed to weathered crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico during summer 2010 may have had reduced hatching success.
569	21500030	Variation in viral shedding patterns between different wild bird species infected experimentally with low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses that originated from wild birds.	Costa TP, Brown JD, Howerth EW, Stallknecht DE	Avian Pathol	 2011 Apr;40(2):119-24	 doi: 101080/030794572010540002	The prevalence of infection with avian influenza (AI) virus varies significantly between taxonomic Orders and even between species within the same Order. The current understanding of AI infection and virus shedding parameters in wild birds is limited and largely based on trials conducted in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). The objective of the present study was to provide experimental data to examine species-related differences in susceptibility and viral shedding associated with wild bird-origin low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses in multiple duck species and gulls. Thus mallards, redheads (Aythya americana), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), and laughing gulls (Leucophaeus atricilla) were inoculated experimentally with three wild mallard-origin LPAI viruses representing multiple subtypes. Variation in susceptibility and patterns of viral shedding associated with LPAI virus infection was evident between the duck and gull species. Consistent with the literature, mallards excreted virus predominantly via the gastrointestinal tract. In wood ducks, redheads, and laughing gulls, AI virus was detected more often in oropharyngeal swabs than cloacal swabs. The results of this study suggest that LPAI shedding varies between taxonomically related avian species. Such differences may be important for understanding the potential role of individual species in the transmission and maintenance of LPAI viruses and may have implications for improving sampling strategies for LPAI detection. Additional comparative studies, which include LPAI viruses originating from non-mallard species, are necessary to further characterize these infections in wild avian species other than mallards and provide a mechanism to explain these differences in viral excretion.
570	21497461	Typing of Brachyspira spp. from rodents, pigs and chickens on Swedish farms.	Backhans A, Jansson DS, Aspan A, Fellstrom C	Vet Microbiol	 2011 Nov 21;153(1-2):156-62	 doi: 101016/jvetmic201103023 Epub 2011 Mar 26	The aim of the current study was to look for evidence of possible cross-species transmission of Brachyspira species between rodents and farm animals. To do this, previously collected and characterised Brachyspira isolates from rodents, pigs and chickens on the same farms were analysed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Isolates with similar RAPD banding patterns were further typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identical isolates of Brachyspira pilosicoli, Brachyspira intermedia, Brachyspira murdochii and Brachyspira innocens from pigs and rodents and of B. murdochii from laying hens and rodents were found, indicating cross-species transmission at farm level. PFGE data from rodent isolates of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae were compared with PFGE data from previously typed field isolates of B. hyodysenteriae from pigs with swine dysentery and isolates from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Three of four isolates of B. hyodysenteriae from rodents were similar to porcine field isolates by PFGE. PCR analyses of the plasmid-encoded and potential virulence determinants rfb genes B, A, D and C showed that they were present in isolates of B. hyodysenteriae of porcine, mallard and rodent origin.
571	21490006	Sexual ornamentation reflects antibacterial activity of ejaculates in mallards.	Rowe M, Czirjak GA, McGraw KJ, Giraudeau M	Biol Lett	 2011 Oct 23;7(5):740-2	 doi: 101098/rsbl20110276 Epub 2011 Apr 13	Bacteria present in ejaculates can impair sperm function and reduce male reproductive success. Thus, selection should favour the evolution of antimicrobial defences to limit the detrimental effects of sperm-associated bacteria. Additionally, current hypotheses suggest that ornamental traits may signal information about the infection status of an individual or the ability of an individual to resist bacterial-induced sperm damage. However, despite the evolutionary implications of ejaculate antimicrobials, and the putative importance of pathogens for the evolution of male ornamentation, tests of these hypotheses are lacking. We examined the antibacterial activity of semen from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and tested whether the bactericidal capacity of semen was associated with bill coloration, a sexually selected trait. We show that mallard semen exhibits significant antibacterial activity, as measured by the in vitro capacity to kill Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that males with more colourful bills have semen with superior bacterial-killing ability. These results suggest that females could use male phenotypic traits to avoid sexually transmitted pathogens and acquire partners whose sperm suffer less bacteria-induced damage.
572	21483843	Transmission of avian influenza A viruses among species in an artificial barnyard.	Achenbach JE, Bowen RA	PLoS One	 2011 Mar 31;6(3):e17643	 doi: 101371/journalpone0017643	Waterfowl and shorebirds harbor and shed all hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes of influenza A viruses and interact in nature with a broad range of other avian and mammalian species to which they might transmit such viruses. Estimating the efficiency and importance of such cross-species transmission using epidemiological approaches is difficult. We therefore addressed this question by studying transmission of low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses from infected ducks to other common animals in a quasi-natural laboratory environment designed to mimic a common barnyard. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) recently infected with H5N2 or H7N3 viruses were introduced into a room housing other mallards plus chickens, blackbirds, rats and pigeons, and transmission was assessed by monitoring virus shedding (ducks) or seroconversion (other species) over the following 4 weeks. Additional animals of each species were directly inoculated with virus to characterize the effect of a known exposure. In both barnyard experiments, virus accumulated to high titers in the shared water pool. The H5N2 virus was transmitted from infected ducks to other ducks and chickens in the room either directly or through environmental contamination, but not to rats or blackbirds. Ducks infected with the H7N2 virus transmitted directly or indirectly to all other species present. Chickens and blackbirds directly inoculated with these viruses shed significant amounts of virus and seroconverted; rats and pigeons developed antiviral antibodies, but, except for one pigeon, failed to shed virus.
573	21477844	Will leaded young mallards take wing- Effects of a single lead shot ingestion on growth of juvenile game-farm Mallard ducks Anas platyrhynchos.	Plouzeau E, Guillard O, Pineau A, Billiald P, Berny P	Sci Total Environ	 2011 May 15;409(12):2379-83	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv201103012 Epub 2011 Apr 7	This study aims to monitor retention of a single ingested lead shot in young mallards, and to evaluate effect on growth in relation to lead shot size class during late wing growth and the first wing molt period (8 to 12 weeks old). Toxicological tests, radiography and biometric measurements were conducted on 51 juvenile Mallard ducks. Forty one of them were given per os a single lead shot in three different commercially available sizes: No. 2 (LS2), No. 4 (LS4) and No. 6 (LS6). Less than 20% of total lead shots were found on X-rays at Day 21 (D) and none remained at D28, with mean retention time in gizzard calculated 12.85+/-1.34 days for all treated groups. Young ducks developed high blood lead levels for each LS treatment at D15 in males and females, the maximal values being for LS2 (297.00+/-78.64 mug/100 mL and 483.14+/-83.70 mug/100 mL, respectively (p<0.001)). Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) levels increased at D15 with LS2 and LS4 in males and only with LS6 in females. Treated ducks developed no symptoms of plumbism except light diarrhea, and at D40, all mallards had survived. We found that LS2 pellets released more lead in gizzards and produced the highest levels of blood lead, suggesting that LS2 pellets are more likely to intoxicate mallards than smaller sizes. The biometric measurements performed showed no statistical difference in weight or bill and wing length between control and treated groups, a finding suggesting that absorption of a single lead shot by young Mallard ducks does not affect their development during the first wing molt period, and appears not to compromise the flight capacity of young (post-juvenile) mallards. However, younger mallards and/or effects on growth of exposure to more than a single-shot dose still need to be investigated.
574	21441197	Characterization of velogenic Newcastle disease viruses isolated from dead wild birds in Serbia during 2007.	Vidanovic D, Sekler M, Asanin R, Milic N, Nisavic J, Petrovic T, Savic V	J Wildl Dis	 2011 Apr;47(2):433-41	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-472433	Avian paramyxoviruses type 1 or Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) are frequently recovered from wild birds and such isolates are most frequently of low virulence. Velogenic NDV are usually recovered from poultry and only occasionally from wild birds. Five NDV isolates were obtained from carcasses of four wild bird species during 2007 in Serbia: Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), feral Rock Pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto). All the isolates have a typical fusion protein cleavage site motif of velogenic viruses ((112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117)). The highest homology (99%) for the nucleotide sequences spanning the M and F gene of the studied isolates was with the genotype VII NDV isolate Muscovy duck/China(Fujian)/FP1/02. Phylogenetic analysis based on a partial F gene sequence showed that the isolates from wild birds cluster together with concurrent isolates from poultry in Serbia within the subgenotype VIId, which is the predominant pathogen involved currently in Newcastle disease outbreaks in poultry worldwide. It is unlikely that the wild birds played an important role in primary introduction or consequent spread of the velogenic NDV to domestic poultry in Serbia, and they probably contracted the virus from locally infected poultry.
575	21441193	Replication of low pathogenic avian influenza virus in naturally infected Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) causes no morphologic lesions.	Daoust PY, Kibenge FS, Fouchier RA, van de Bildt MW, van Riel D, Kuiken T	J Wildl Dis	 2011 Apr;47(2):401-9	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-472401	Although the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is considered an important maintenance host for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, viral cell tropism and pathology in naturally infected birds are largely unknown. In August 2006, we collected 19 free-living hatch-year Mallards that were positive for LPAI virus by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in combined oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs. We investigated virus infection and associated lesions in the digestive and respiratory tracts by RRT-PCR, virus culture, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and histology. By RRT-PCR, 15 birds were positive in cloacal bursa, colon/cloaca, or both, and three were positive in lungs. Virus was isolated from eight birds and typed as H2N3 (three birds), H3N3 (two birds), H3N8 (one bird), H4N6 (one bird), and H-N3 (one bird). By IHC, birds were positive in the cloacal bursa (eight birds), colon (three), cecum (two), or ileum (one). Cell types infected were superficial epithelial cells of the bursa and epithelial cells of the intestinal villi and, less commonly, mucosal glands. By histology, there was no evidence of lesions associated with LPAI virus infection. These results show that epithelia of the cloacal bursa and of the lower intestine are important sites of natural LPAI virus infection in free-living hatch-year Mallards. The lack of lesions associated with this infection suggests that there is a strong selection by LPAI virus to cause minimal virulence in this maintenance host species.

Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR, Kondrad SL, Erwin CA	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2011 Jul;30(7):1593-8	 doi: 101002/etc530 Epub 2011 Apr 27	Controlled laboratory studies with game farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and chickens (Gallus gallus) have demonstrated that methylmercury can cause teratogenic effects in birds, but studies with wild species of birds are lacking. To address this need, doses of methylmercury chloride were injected into the eggs of 25 species of birds, and the dead embryos and hatched chicks were examined for external deformities. When data for controls were summed across all 25 species tested and across all types of deformities, 24 individuals out of a total of 1,533 (a rate of 1.57%) exhibited at least one deformity. In contrast, when data for all of the mercury treatments and all 25 species were summed, 188 deformed individuals out of a total of 2,292 (8.20%) were found. Some deformities, such as lordosis and scoliosis (twisting of the spine), misshapen heads, shortening or twisting of the neck, and deformities of the wings, were seldom observed in controls but occurred in much greater frequency in Hg-treated individuals. Only 0.59% of individual control dead embryos and hatchlings exhibited multiple deformities versus 3.18% for Hg-dosed dead embryos and hatchlings. Methylmercury seems to have a widespread teratogenic potential across many species of birds.
577	21424223	Behavioral, clinical, and pathological characterization of acid metalliferous water toxicity in mallards.	Isanhart JP, Wu H, Pandher K, MacRae RK, Cox SB, Hooper MJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2011 Nov;61(4):653-67	 doi: 101007/s00244-011-9657-z Epub 2011 Mar 19	From September to November 2000, United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologists investigated incidents involving 221 bird deaths at 3 mine sites located in New Mexico and Arizona. These bird deaths primarily involved passerine and waterfowl species and were assumed to be linked to consumption of acid metalliferous water (AMW). Because all of the carcasses were found in or near pregnant leach solution ponds, tailings ponds, and associated lakes or storm water retention basins, an acute-toxicity study was undertaken using a synthetic AMW (SAMW) formulation based on the contaminant profile of a representative pond believed to be responsible for avian mortalities. An acute oral-toxicity trial was performed with a mixed-sex group of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). After a 24-h pretreatment food and water fast, gorge drinking was evident in both SAMW treatment and control groups, with water consumption rates greatest during the initial drinking periods. Seven of nine treated mallards were killed in extremis within 12 h after the initiation of dose. Total lethal doses of SAMW ranged from 69.8 to 270.1 mL/kg (mean +/- SE 127.9 +/- 27.1). Lethal doses of SAMW were consumed in as few as 20 to 40 min after first exposure. Clinical signs of SAMW toxicity included increased serum uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, potassium, and P levels. PCV values of SAMW-treated birds were also increased compared with control mallards. Histopathological lesions were observed in the esophagus, proventriculus, ventriculus, and duodenum of SAMW-treated mallards, with the most distinctive being erosion and ulceration of the kaolin of the ventriculus, ventricular hemorrhage and/or congestion, and duodenal hemorrhage. Clinical, pathological, and tissue-residue results from this study are consistent with literature documenting acute metal toxicosis, especially copper (Cu), in avian species and provide useful diagnostic profiles for AMW toxicity or mortality events. Blood and kidney Cu concentrations were 23- and 6-fold greater, respectively, in SAMW mortalities compared with controls, whereas Cu concentrations in liver were not nearly as increased, suggesting that blood and kidney concentrations may be more useful than liver concentrations for diagnosing Cu toxicosis in wild birds. Based on these findings and other reports of AMW toxicity events in wild birds, we conclude that AMW bodies pose a significant hazard to wildlife that come in contact with them.
578	21411076	Effects of lead exposure on oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma biochemistry in waterbirds in the field.	Martinez-Haro M, Green AJ, Mateo R	Environ Res	 2011 May;111(4):530-8	 doi: 101016/jenvres201102012 Epub 2011 Mar 16	Medina lagoon in Andalusia has one of the highest densities of spent lead (Pb) shot in Europe. Blood samples from waterbirds were collected in 2006-2008 to measure Pb concentration (PbB), delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma biochemistry. PbB above background levels (>20 mug/dl) was observed in 19% (n=59) of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and in all common pochards (Aythya ferina) (n=4), but common coots (Fulica atra) (n=37) and moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) (n=12) were all <20 mug/dl. ALAD ratio in mallards and coots decreased with PbB levels >6 mug/dl. In mallards, an inhibition of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and an increased level of oxidized glutathione (oxGSH) in red blood cells (RBC) were associated with PbB levels >20 mug/dl. In coots, PbB levels were negatively related to vitamin A and carotenoid levels in plasma, and total glutathione in RBCs; and positively related with higher superoxide dismutase and GPx activities and % oxGSH in RBCs. Overall, the results indicate that previously assumed background levels of PbB for birds need to be revised.
579	21410945	Genome wide SNP discovery, analysis and evaluation in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Kraus RH, Kerstens HH, Van Hooft P, Crooijmans RP, Van Der Poel JJ, Elmberg J, Vignal A, Huang Y, Li N, Prins HH, Groenen MA	BMC Genomics	 2011 Mar 16;12:150	 doi: 101186/1471-2164-12-150	BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing technologies allow to obtain at low cost the genomic sequence information that currently lacks for most economically and ecologically important organisms. For the mallard duck genomic data is limited. The mallard is, besides a species of large agricultural and societal importance, also the focal species when it comes to long distance dispersal of Avian Influenza. For large scale identification of SNPs we performed Illumina sequencing of wild mallard DNA and compared our data with ongoing genome and EST sequencing of domesticated conspecifics. This is the first study of its kind for waterfowl. RESULTS: More than one billion base pairs of sequence information were generated resulting in a 16x coverage of a reduced representation library of the mallard genome. Sequence reads were aligned to a draft domesticated duck reference genome and allowed for the detection of over 122,000 SNPs within our mallard sequence dataset. In addition, almost 62,000 nucleotide positions on the domesticated duck reference showed a different nucleotide compared to wild mallard. Approximately 20,000 SNPs identified within our data were shared with SNPs identified in the sequenced domestic duck or in EST sequencing projects. The shared SNPs were considered to be highly reliable and were used to benchmark non-shared SNPs for quality. Genotyping of a representative sample of 364 SNPs resulted in a SNP conversion rate of 99.7%. The correlation of the minor allele count and observed minor allele frequency in the SNP discovery pool was 0.72. CONCLUSION: We identified almost 150,000 SNPs in wild mallards that will likely yield good results in genotyping. Of these, ~101,000 SNPs were detected within our wild mallard sequences and ~49,000 were detected between wild and domesticated duck data. In the ~101,000 SNPs we found a subset of ~20,000 SNPs shared between wild mallards and the sequenced domesticated duck suggesting a low genetic divergence. Comparison of quality metrics between the total SNP set (122,000 + 62,000 = 184,000 SNPs) and the validated subset shows similar characteristics for both sets. This indicates that we have detected a large amount (~150,000) of accurately inferred mallard SNPs, which will benefit bird evolutionary studies, ecological studies (e.g. disentangling migratory connectivity) and industrial breeding programs.
580	21406369	Computer-generated radiological imagery of the structure of the spongious substance in the postnatal development of the tibiotarsal bones of the Peking domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica).	Charuta A, Dzierzecka M, Majchrzak T, Czerwinski E, Cooper RG	Poult Sci	 2011 Apr;90(4):830-5	 doi: 103382/ps2010-01031	The evaluation of the structure of the spongious substance of the tibiotarsal (TT) bones of the domestic duck aged 4 to 8 wk was performed using radiological analysis. The Trabecula program (Czerwinski, 1994) used in the study identified a map of radiological trabeculae and calculated the number, average volume, density, and width of trabeculae. It was stated that the number of trabeculae differed significantly (P </= 0.05) variant on age, sex, and a unique fragment of the studied bone. Six-week-old hens whose TT bones were most often exposed to deformities and fractures possessed attenuated bone mass. The number of trabeculae per 1 mm(2) during breeding was the lowest (10.34 and 9.54 mm(2) in the proximal and distal epiphyses, respectively). The tibial bones of the 6-wk-old hens also possessed the lowest volume of trabeculae (44.62 and 39.84% for the proximal and distal epiphyses, respectively). Dependant variances between the BW, the number of recognized radiological trabeculae, and the volume, density, and width of trabeculae were calculated using a selected correlation and regression coefficient (r = 0.41; P </= 0.05). Results expounded a unique linear relationship between BW and the volume of trabeculae. Indeed, the larger the BW, the more numerous the trabeculae observed. No significant correlation was determined between the BW and the number of recognized trabeculae nor their density and width. A small number of trabeculae and the lowered density may be the cause of fractures and deformities of the TT bones of the domestic duck.
581	21337606	Acute toxicity, histopathology, and coagulopathy in American kestrels (Falco sparverius) following administration of the rodenticide diphacinone.	Rattner BA, Horak KE, Warner SE, Day DD, Meteyer CU, Volker SF, Eisemann JD, Johnston JJ	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2011 May;30(5):1213-22	 doi: 101002/etc490 Epub 2011 Mar 11	The acute oral toxicity of the anticoagulant rodenticide diphacinone was found to be over 20 times greater in American kestrels (Falco sparverius; median lethal dose 96.8 mg/kg body weight) compared with Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Modest evidence of internal bleeding was observed at necropsy, although histological examination of heart, liver, kidney, lung, intestine, and skeletal muscle revealed hemorrhage over a wide range of doses (35.1-675 mg/kg). Residue analysis suggests that the half-life of diphacinone in the liver of kestrels that survived was relatively short, with the majority of the dose cleared within 7 d of exposure. Several precise and sensitive clotting assays (prothrombin time, Russell's viper venom time, thrombin clotting time) were adapted for use in this species, and oral administration of diphacinone at 50 mg/kg increased prothrombin time and Russell's viper venom time at 48 and 96 h postdose compared with controls. Prolongation of in vitro clotting time reflects impaired coagulation complex activity, and generally corresponded with the onset of overt signs of toxicity and lethality. In view of the toxicity and risk evaluation data derived from American kestrels, the involvement of diphacinone in some raptor mortality events, and the paucity of threshold effects data following short-term dietary exposure for birds of prey, additional feeding trials with captive raptors are warranted to characterize more fully the risk of secondary poisoning.
582	21313851	Effect of a prior exposure to a low pathogenic avian influenza virus in the outcome of a heterosubtypic low pathogenic avian influenza infection in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Costa TP, Brown JD, Howerth EW, Stallknecht DE	Avian Dis	 2010 Dec;54(4):1286-91	 doi: 101637/9480-072210-Reg1	Wild birds, particularly Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, are considered the natural reservoir of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. The high prevalence and subtype diversity of avian influenza viruses at premigrational staging areas provide the perfect opportunity for multiple exposures to different LPAI virus subtypes. Natural consecutive and concurrent infections of sentinel ducks with different LPAI virus subtypes have been reported. The protective immune response from different LPAI virus infections is not understood nor is the effect of such repeated exposures. This study experimentally evaluated the effect of a prior exposure to a LPAI virus on the outcome of a heterosubtypic LPAI virus infection in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). The results of this investigation suggest that recent prior exposure to a LPAI virus may affect the outcome of a subsequent heterosubtypic LPAI infection in mallards by reducing the duration of cloacal and oropharyngeal viral shedding as well as the viral load excreted via the cloaca. Wild mallards are likely exposed to multiple subtypes of LPAI virus during the periods of peak viral circulation, and the results of this study suggest that the duration of viral shedding in subsequent exposures might be reduced.
583	21310090	Characterization of a non-pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus isolated from a migratory duck flying from Siberia in Hokkaido, Japan, in October 2009.	Yamamoto N, Sakoda Y, Motoshima M, Yoshino F, Soda K, Okamatsu M, Kida H	Virol J	 2011 Feb 11;8:65	 doi: 101186/1743-422X-8-65	BACKGROUND: Infection with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of domestic poultry and wild birds has spread to more than 60 countries in Eurasia and Africa. It is concerned that HPAIVs may be perpetuated in the lakes in Siberia where migratory water birds nest in summer. To monitor whether HPAIVs circulate in migratory water birds, intensive surveillance of avian influenza has been performed in Mongolia and Japan in autumn each year. Until 2008, there had not been any H5N1 viruses isolated from migratory water birds that flew from their nesting lakes in Siberia. In autumn 2009, A/mallard/Hokkaido/24/09 (H5N1) (Mal/Hok/24/09) was isolated from a fecal sample of a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) that flew from Siberia to Hokkaido, Japan. The isolate was assessed for pathogenicity in chickens, domestic ducks, and quails and analyzed antigenically and phylogenetically. RESULTS: No clinical signs were observed in chickens inoculated intravenously with Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1). There was no viral replication in chickens inoculated intranasally with the isolate. None of the domestic ducks and quails inoculated intranasally with the isolate showed any clinical signs. There were no multiple basic amino acid residues at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the isolate. Each gene of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is phylogenetically closely related to that of influenza viruses isolated from migratory water birds that flew from their nesting lakes in autumn. Additionally, the antigenicity of the HA of the isolate was similar to that of the viruses isolated from migratory water birds in Hokkaido that flew from their northern territory in autumn and different from those of HPAIVs isolated from birds found dead in China, Mongolia, and Japan on the way back to their northern territory in spring. CONCLUSION: Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is a non-pathogenic avian influenza virus for chickens, domestic ducks, and quails, and is antigenically and genetically distinct from the H5N1 HPAIVs prevailing in birds in Eurasia and Africa. H5 viruses with the HA gene of HPAIV had not been isolated from migratory water birds in the surveillance until 2009, indicating that H5N1 HPAIVs had not become dominant in their nesting lakes in Siberia until 2009.
584	21302761	Use of a portable tower and remote-controlled launcher to improve physical conditioning in a rehabilitating wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Pollard-Wright HM, Wright MT, Warren JM	J Avian Med Surg	 2010 Dec;24(4):308-15	 doi: 101647/2009-0501	Prerelease reconditioning improves the chance of survival of rehabilitating raptors. Reconditioning may also help to rehabilitate waterfowl, including those that are threatened or endangered, especially if the birds are released during periods of migration. A flying harness, creance, remote-controlled launcher, and portable tower were used to create a means of reconditioning a rehabilitating 5-month-old female wild mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) that had been housed in a rehabilitation center for 7 weeks while recovering from an injury. Pre- and postflight serum lactate levels, body condition index scores, and controlled flight distances were used to assess the bird's degree of conditioning. Postflight serum lactate levels never returned to preflight levels and were not deemed a reliable indicator of physical fitness. However, the mallard showed an increase in endurance and strength as well as improved body condition index scores over the course of the reconditioning program.
585	21290415	The morphology of neoptile feathers: ancestral state reconstruction and its phylogenetic implications.	Foth C	J Morphol	 2011 Apr;272(4):387-403	 doi: 101002/jmor10916 Epub 2011 Feb 2	Avian neoptile feathers are defined as the first feather generation, which covers the chick after hatching, and usually described as simple structures consisting of numerous downy barbs which are radially symmetrically arranged and come together in a short calamus. In contrast, in some birds (e.g., Anas platyrhynchos, Dromaius novaehollandiae) the neoptile feathers have a prominent rhachis, and therefore display clear bilateral symmetry. Because the symmetrical variety found in neoptile feathers is poorly understood, their morphology was studied in a more comprehensive and phylogenetic approach. Neoptile body feathers from over 22 bird species were investigated using light microscopy, SEM, and MicroCT. Characters such as an anterior-posterior axis, a central rhachis, medullary cells, and structure of the calamus wall were defined and mapped onto recent phylogenetic hypotheses for extant birds. It can be shown that bilaterally symmetric neoptile feathers (with a solid calamus wall) were already present in the stem lineage of crown-group birds (Neornithes). In contrast, simple radially symmetric neoptile feathers (with a fragile calamus wall) are an apomorphic character complex for the clade Neoaves. The simple morphology of this feather type may be the result of a reduced period of development during embryogenesis. To date, embryogenesis of neoptile feathers from only a few bird species was used as a model to reconstruct feather evolution. Because this study shows that the morphology of neoptile feathers is more diverse and even shows a clear phylogenetic signal, it is necessary to expand the spectrum of "model organisms" to species with bilaterally symmetric neoptile feathers and compare differences in the frequency of feather development from a phylogenetic point of view.
586	21270016	Avian influenza viruses and avian paramyxoviruses in wintering and breeding waterfowl populations in North Carolina, USA.	Goekjian VH, Smith JT, Howell DL, Senne DA, Swayne DE, Stallknecht DE	J Wildl Dis	 2011 Jan;47(1):240-5	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-471240	Although wild ducks are recognized reservoirs for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs), information related to the prevalence of these viruses in breeding and migratory duck populations on North American wintering grounds is limited. Wintering (n=2,889) and resident breeding (n=524) ducks were sampled in North Carolina during winter 2004-2006 and summer 2005-2006, respectively. Overall prevalence of AIV was 0.8% and restricted to the winter sample; however, prevalence in species within the genus Anas was 1.3% and was highest in Black Ducks (7%; Anas rubripes) and Northern Shovelers (8%; Anas clypeata). Of the 24 AIVs, 16 subtypes were detected, representing nine hemagglutinin and seven neuraminidase subtypes. Avian paramyxoviruses detected in wintering birds included 18 APMV-1s, 15 APMV-4s, and one APMV-6. During summers 2005 and 2006, a high prevalence of APMV-1 infection was observed in resident breeding Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).
587	21248325	Does access to open water affect the health of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos)-	O'Driscoll KK, Broom DM	Poult Sci	 2011 Feb;90(2):299-307	 doi: 103382/ps2010-00883	Access to open water is considered good for the welfare of Pekin ducks. These studies investigated the effect that the type of water resource, provided over either straw bedding or a rubber mesh, had on measures of duck health. Pekin strain ducklings (n = 2,600) were managed in pens of 100 on straw over a solid concrete floor. In study 1, one of two water resources (nipple, n = 5 pens; wide-lip bell drinker, n = 5 pens), was located directly over the straw. In study 2, one of three water resources (narrow-lip bell drinker, n = 6 pens; trough, n = 5 pens; and bath, n = 5 pens) was located over a rubber mesh. On d 16, 24, 29, 35, and 43, (study 1) or d 21, 29, 35, and 43 posthatch (study 2), 10 birds were selected from each pen and weighed, and then feather hygiene, footpad dermatitis, eye health, gait score, and nostril condition scores were taken. Treatment had no effect on BW in either study, but in study 2, ducks in the open water treatments had higher scores (P < 0.001) than those in the narrow-lip bell drinker treatment by d 43. In study 1, treatment had no effect on hygiene scores, but scores increased over time (P < 0.001). In study 2, ducks in the narrow-lip bell drinker treatment were dirtier than those in the bath treatment (P = 0.01), with those in the trough treatment being intermediate. In both studies, ducks with bell drinkers had worse gait scores than those in the other treatments (study 1, P < 0.01; study 2, P < 0.05). Treatment had no effect on eye health scores. However, ducks were less likely to have dirty nostrils when provided with more open water resources in both studies (P < 0.01), or were less likely to have blocked nostrils in the trough and bath treatments than in the narrow-lip bell drinker treatment in study 2 (P = 0.01). Provision of open water, particularly over a properly constructed drainage area, improved some aspects of duck health (improved feather hygiene and BW, and fewer dirty and blocked nostrils). However, further work is needed to investigate these treatments on a commercial scale.
588	23074663	The modes of evolutionary emergence of primal and late pandemic influenza virus strains from viral reservoir in animals: an interdisciplinary analysis.	Shoham D	Influenza Res Treat	 2011;2011:861792	 doi: 101155/2011/861792 Epub 2011 Nov 15	Based on a wealth of recent findings, in conjunction with earliest chronologies pertaining to evolutionary emergences of ancestral RNA viruses, ducks, Influenzavirus A (assumingly within ducks), and hominids, as well as to the initial domestication of mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and wild horse (Equus ferus), presumed genesis modes of primordial pandemic influenza strains have multidisciplinarily been configured. The virological fundamentality of domestication and farming of those various avian and mammalian species has thereby been demonstrated and broadly elucidated, within distinctive coevolutionary paradigms. The mentioned viral genesis modes were then analyzed, compatibly with common denominators and flexibility that mark the geographic profile of the last 18 pandemic strains, which reputedly emerged since 1510, the antigenic profile of the last 10 pandemic strains since 1847, and the genomic profile of the last 5 pandemic strains since 1918, until present. Related ecophylogenetic and biogeographic aspects have been enlightened, alongside with the crucial role of spatial virus gene dissemination by avian hosts. A fairly coherent picture of primary and late evolutionary and genomic courses of pandemic strains has thus been attained, tentatively. Specific patterns underlying complexes prone to generate past and future pandemic strains from viral reservoir in animals are consequentially derived.
589	21171838	Pharmacokinetics of voriconazole in adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Kline Y, Clemons KV, Woods L, Stevens DA, Tell LA	Med Mycol	 2011 Jul;49(5):500-12	 doi: 103109/136937862010542553 Epub 2010 Dec 20	The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole (VRC) administered intravenously (IV) or orally (PO; with and without liquid diet) to mallard ducks were studied. Dose range, drug bioavailability, and single and multiple treatment pharmacokinetics studies were performed. Plasma samples were collected for ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) or bioassay analysis. Tissue samples were collected for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and histology. No overt signs of toxicity were observed during any of the studies regardless of administration route, and no histologic lesions/changes were attributed to VRC treatment. Average +/- SD bioavailability after a single oral dose was 60.7% +/- 16.5. Based on a targeted minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.5 mug/ml VRC, a dose of 20 mg per kg body weight for the multi-dose pharmacokinetic study was selected. Pharmacokinetic parameter differences between birds dosed with VRC, with or without liquid diet, were not clinically significant. The bioassay had an overall positive bias (+23.5%) compared to the UPLC. Single or multiple-day VRC dosing via IV or PO routes at differing dosages resulted in tissue concentrations that were below the HPLC assay's limit of detection (0.1 mug VRC per g tissue). This study indicates that treatment of mallard ducks with VRC might require a dosing interval of at least every 8-12 h at a dose of 20 mg/kg, but further studies are necessary.
590	21168259	Learning and adaptation in the management of waterfowl harvests.	Johnson FA	J Environ Manage	 2011 May;92(5):1385-94	 doi: 101016/jjenvman201010064 Epub 2010 Dec 18	A formal framework for the adaptive management of waterfowl harvests was adopted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1995. The process admits competing models of waterfowl population dynamics and harvest impacts, and relies on model averaging to compute optimal strategies for regulating harvest. Model weights, reflecting the relative ability of the alternative models to predict changes in population size, are used in the model averaging and are updated each year based on a comparison of model predictions and observations of population size. Since its inception the adaptive harvest program has focused principally on mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), which constitute a large portion of the U.S. waterfowl harvest. Four competing models, derived from a combination of two survival and two reproductive hypotheses, were originally assigned equal weights. In the last year of available information (2007), model weights favored the weakly density-dependent reproductive hypothesis over the strongly density-dependent one, and the additive mortality hypothesis over the compensatory one. The change in model weights led to a more conservative harvesting policy than what was in effect in the early years of the program. Adaptive harvest management has been successful in many ways, but nonetheless has exposed the difficulties in defining management objectives, in predicting and regulating harvests, and in coping with the tradeoffs inherent in managing multiple waterfowl stocks exposed to a common harvest. The key challenge now facing managers is whether adaptive harvest management as an institution can be sufficiently adaptive, and whether the knowledge and experience gained from the process can be reflected in higher-level policy decisions.
591	21161790	Inhibitory effects of epidermal growth factor on progesterone production of ovarian granulosa cells in Tsaiya duck (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica).	Chiu CH, Fei CY, Srinivasan R, Wu LS	Br Poult Sci	 2010 Dec;51(6):821-7	 doi: 101080/000716682010499141	1. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on progesterone (P(4)) secretion from ovarian granulosa cells in Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica). 2. We obtained the largest (F1) follicle from Tsaiya duck, the granulosa layer was separated and the cells were isolated according to their proximity to the germinal disc. 3. The granulosa cells were cultured in vitro, the culture media and the cells were used to determine P(4) and steroidogenic enzyme concentrations, respectively. 4. P(4) concentrations were decreased in cultured granulosa cells taken proximal to the germinal disc (GD) compared to those distal to the germinal disc (NGD). 5. EGF inhibited both basal and ovine luteinising hormone (oLH)-induced P(4) concentrations. It also inhibited the P(4) secretion via protein kinase A (PKA) pathway when cultured with GD and NGD granulose cells (mixed together) in vitro. 6. Western blot results showed decreased concentrations of cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) enzyme and steroid acute regulatory (StAR) protein expression, when the cells were co-treated with EGF and oLH. 7. The inhibitory effect of oLH-induced P(4) production was attenuated by EGF by the addition of MAP-erk kinase (MEK) inhibitor (PD98059) suggests EGF may inhibit P(4) production by affecting via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
592	21154053	Large-scale survey of Cryptosporidium spp. in chickens and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in Henan, China: prevalence and molecular characterization.	Wang R, Jian F, Sun Y, Hu Q, Zhu J, Wang F, Ning C, Zhang L, Xiao L	Avian Pathol	 2010 Dec;39(6):447-51	 doi: 101080/030794572010518314	Few data are available on the molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. in chickens and ducks in China. In this study, 2579 faecal samples from 46 chicken farms and eight Pekin duck farms in 21 prefectures in Henan Province were examined. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium was 10.6% (163/1542) in layer chickens (10 out of 17 farms), 3.4% (16/473) in broilers (five out of 29 farms), and 16.3% (92/564) in Pekin ducks (four out of eight farms), respectively. The highest infection rates were observed in 31-day-old to 60-day-old layer chickens (24.6%) and 11-day-old to 30-day-old Pekin ducks (40.3%). The season of highest prevalence in chickens was spring (15.6%) and the lowest was winter (P<0.01). One hundred and eighty-seven Cryptosporidium-positive samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene, and 55 were further analysed by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Two Cryptosporidium species were identified: Cryptosporidium baileyi (184/187) on 15 chicken farms and four duck farms, and Cryptosporidium meleagridis (3/187) on three layer chicken farms. C. baileyi was the predominant Cryptosporidium species, found in all age groups of chickens and all Cryptosporidium-positive ducks examined, whereas C. meleagridis was only identified in 31-day-old to 120-day-old layer chickens. Considering the large size of the chicken industry and the close contact between chickens and humans, and that C. meleagridis is the third most common Cryptosporidium parasite in humans, then C. meleagridis could potentially become an emerging zoonosis in some areas in China.
593	21140156	Past or present- Relative contributions of developmental and adult conditions to adult immune function and coloration in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Butler MW, McGraw KJ	J Comp Physiol B	 2011 May;181(4):551-63	 doi: 101007/s00360-010-0529-z Epub 2010 Dec 8	Developmental conditions affect adult physiological processes and phenotypic traits, including those associated with both survival and reproduction. Carotenoids are molecules that generate sexually attractive coloration, and these pigments are acquired throughout life and can affect antioxidant capacity and immunocompetence of young and old animals. However, few studies have tracked carotenoid status and condition during development and into adulthood to understand how ontogeny affects later-life health and coloration of both males and females. We reared male and female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) from hatch to adulthood, measured circulating carotenoid titers and body condition (i.e., size-adjusted body mass) throughout development, and assessed adult immune function and integumentary carotenoid-based beak and foot coloration. We found that adult immune function (wing web swelling response to phytohemagglutinin; PHA) in males was positively correlated with body condition during the growth period of development, rather than adult condition, and similarly that both male and female beak coloration was associated with developmental, rather than adult, body condition. We also found associations between coloration and health during adulthood; males with more carotenoid-rich beaks (a sexually attractive feature) tended to have a more robust adult PHA response and a greater antibody response to a novel antigen, while females with less carotenoid-rich beaks had greater antibody responsiveness at adulthood. In addition, male beak color changed over the course of the 24-h PHA test in proportion to the degree of PHA swelling. However, intensity of foot coloration (a trait of unknown sexual significance) was not associated with any condition, carotenoid, or immune metric for males or females. Taken together, our findings implicate key developmental components to the expression of both survival- and reproduction-related traits at adulthood, but that for a dynamic trait like beak color, there are also important adult conditions that can alter signal expression.
594	21082261	Identification of adipose differentiation-related protein gene in Peking duck and its expression profile in various duck tissues.	Wu Y, Liu X, Hou S, Xiao H, Zhang H	Mol Biol Rep	 2011 Apr;38(4):2479-84	 doi: 101007/s11033-010-0384-8 Epub 2010 Nov 17	Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) is a protein which induced during the early onset of the adipose differentiation program and is expressed at high level in mature adipocytes. In the present study, 1311 bp of ADRP in Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The cloned sequence of ADRP was highly conserved, although relevant changes with respect to human, mouse and chicken were identified. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to determine if the ADRP was expressed in different tissues of male and female Peking ducks. The expression of ADRP was widely distributed in all examined tissues. The expression level of it was highest in abdominal fat and lowest (only few) in lung of male and female Peking ducks.
595	21073586	Interspecific exchange of avian influenza virus genes in Alaska: the influence of trans-hemispheric migratory tendency and breeding ground sympatry.	Pearce JM, Reeves AB, Ramey AM, Hupp JW, Ip HS, Bertram M, Petrula MJ, Scotton BD, Trust KA, Meixell BW, Runstadler JA	Mol Ecol	 2011 Mar;20(5):1015-25	 doi: 101111/j1365-294X201004908x Epub 2010 Nov 12	The movement and transmission of avian influenza viral strains via wild migratory birds may vary by host species as a result of migratory tendency and sympatry with other infected individuals. To examine the roles of host migratory tendency and species sympatry on the movement of Eurasian low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) genes into North America, we characterized migratory patterns and LPAI viral genomic variation in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of Alaska in comparison with LPAI diversity of northern pintails (Anas acuta). A 50-year band-recovery data set suggests that unlike northern pintails, mallards rarely make trans-hemispheric migrations between Alaska and Eurasia. Concordantly, fewer (14.5%) of 62 LPAI isolates from mallards contained Eurasian gene segments compared to those from 97 northern pintails (35%), a species with greater inter-continental migratory tendency. Aerial survey and banding data suggest that mallards and northern pintails are largely sympatric throughout Alaska during the breeding season, promoting opportunities for interspecific transmission. Comparisons of full-genome isolates confirmed near-complete genetic homology (>99.5%) of seven viruses between mallards and northern pintails. This study found viral segments of Eurasian lineage at a higher frequency in mallards than previous studies, suggesting transmission from other avian species migrating inter-hemispherically or the common occurrence of endemic Alaskan viruses containing segments of Eurasian origin. We conclude that mallards are unlikely to transfer Asian-origin viruses directly to North America via Alaska but that they are likely infected with Asian-origin viruses via interspecific transfer from species with regular migrations to the Eastern Hemisphere.
596	21057028	Characterization of garvicin ML, a novel circular bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus garvieae DCC43, isolated from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Borrero J, Brede DA, Skaugen M, Diep DB, Herranz C, Nes IF, Cintas LM, Hernandez PE	Appl Environ Microbiol	 2011 Jan;77(1):369-73	 doi: 101128/AEM01173-10 Epub 2010 Nov 5	Lactococcus garvieae DCC43 produces a bacteriocin, garvicin ML (GarML), with a molecular mass of 6,004.2 Da. Data from de novo amino acid sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry and nucleotide sequencing by reverse genetics suggested that the bacteriocin is synthesized as a 63-amino-acid precursor with a 3-amino-acid leader peptide that is removed by cleavage. Subsequently, a covalent linkage between the N and C termini forms the mature version of this novel 60-amino-acid circular bacteriocin.
597	21048952	Effect of restricted preen-gland access on maternal self maintenance and reproductive investment in mallards.	Giraudeau M, Czirjak GA, Duval C, Bretagnolle V, Eraud C, McGraw KJ, Heeb P	PLoS One	 2010 Oct 27;5(10):e13555	 doi: 101371/journalpone0013555	BACKGROUND: As egg production and offspring care are costly, females should invest resources adaptively into their eggs to optimize current offspring quality and their own lifetime reproductive success. Parasite infections can influence maternal investment decisions due to their multiple negative physiological effects. The act of preening--applying oils with anti-microbial properties to feathers--is thought to be a means by which birds combat pathogens and parasites, but little is known of how preening during the reproductive period (and its expected disease-protecting effects) influences maternal investment decisions at the level of the egg. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we experimentally prevented female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from accessing their preen gland during breeding and monitored female immunoresponsiveness (e.g., plasma lysozyme concentration) as well as some egg traits linked to offspring quality (e.g., egg mass, yolk carotenoid content, and albumen lysozyme levels). Females with no access to their preen gland showed an increase in plasma lysozyme level compared to control, normally preening females. In addition, preen-gland-restricted females laid significantly lighter eggs and deposited higher carotenoid concentrations in the yolk compared to control females. Albumen lysozyme activity did not differ significantly between eggs laid by females with or without preen gland access. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results establish a new link between an important avian self-maintenance behaviour and aspects of maternal health and reproduction. We suggest that higher yolk carotenoid levels in eggs laid by preen-gland-restricted females may serve to boost health of offspring that would hatch in a comparatively microbe-rich environment.
598	20978794	Identification of Sarcocystis rileyi from the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) in Europe: cyst morphology and results of DNA analysis.	Kutkiene L, Prakas P, Sruoga A, Butkauskas D	Parasitol Res	 2011 Mar;108(3):709-14	 doi: 101007/s00436-010-2117-2 Epub 2010 Oct 27	Macroscopic cysts of Sarcocystis in ducks were recorded in Europe, but they were not investigated in more detail. Results of light and electron microscopy as well as 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and ITS-1 region sequences of Sarcocystis macrocysts isolated from naturally infected mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) from Lithuania are presented in this paper. According to ultrastructure results, macrocysts examined corresponds to S. rileyi. Phylogenetic investigation showed S. rileyi to be the most closely related to two unnamed Sarcocystis species from anseriforms and to the S. mucosa. This is the first well-documented case of S. rileyi in Europe.
599	20952638	Antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli bacteria, including strains with genes encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and QnrS, in waterbirds on the Baltic Sea Coast of Poland.	Literak I, Dolejska M, Janoszowska D, Hrusakova J, Meissner W, Rzyska H, Bzoma S, Cizek A	Appl Environ Microbiol	 2010 Dec;76(24):8126-34	 doi: 101128/AEM01446-10 Epub 2010 Oct 15	Individual cloacal swabs of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), as well as samples of waterbird feces obtained in 2008 and 2009, were cultivated for Escherichia coli. Isolates of E. coli were tested for susceptibilities to 12 antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. Moreover, the samples were subcultivated on MacConkey agar (MCA) containing cefotaxime (2 mg liter(-1)) to detect E. coli with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and subsequently on MCA supplemented with ciprofloxacin (0.05 mg liter(-1)) and MCA with nalidixic acid (20 mg liter(-1)) to isolate fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli. PCR was used to detect specific antibiotic resistance genes. We found 9 E. coli isolates producing ESBL with bla genes: bla(CTX-M-1) (6 isolates), bla(CTX-M-9) plus bla(TEM-1b) (1 isolate), bla(CTX-M-15) plus bla(OXA-1) (1 isolate), and bla(SHV-12) (1 isolate). In the isolate with bla(CTX-M-15), the gene aac(6)-Ib-cr was also detected. The bla genes were harbored by transferable plasmids of the IncN and IncI1 groups. Nine quinolone-resistant E. coli isolates with qnrS genes were found and characterized. The gene qnrS was associated with a Tn3-like transposon on the IncX1 plasmid together with bla(TEM-1) in two isolates. The gene qnrS was also harbored by conjugative plasmids of the IncN and IncX2 groups. Even if populations of wild birds are not directly influenced by antibiotic practice, we have demonstrated that antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains, including strains with various ESBL and qnrS genes, are found in the feces of wild birds on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Poland.
600	20945793	Surveillance and identification of influenza A viruses in wild aquatic birds in the Crimea, Ukraine (2006-2008).	Kulak MV, Ilinykh FA, Zaykovskaya AV, Epanchinzeva AV, Evstaphiev IL, Tovtunec NN, Sharshov KA, Durimanov AG, Penkovskaya NA, Shestopalov AM, Lerman AI, Drozdov IG, Swayne DE	Avian Dis	 2010 Sep;54(3):1086-90	 doi: 101637/9272-020510-ResNote1	The ecology of avian influenza (AI) viruses in wild aquatic birds of Asia is poorly understood, especially for the H5N1 high pathogenicity AI (HPAI) viruses. From March 2006 through November 2008, 20 AI viruses were isolated in the Crimea region of Ukraine with an overall frequency of virus recovery of 3.3%. All the viruses were isolated from three species of dabbling ducks: mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), wigeon (Anas penelope), and garganey (Anas querquedula), making the frequency of virus recovery for dabbling ducks 6.3%. The viruses were predominantly isolated during the fall sampling period. All viruses were genetically and antigenically characterized. No H5N1 HPAI viruses were isolated, but other HA and NA subtypes were identified including H3N1 (2), H3N6 (3), H3N8 (4), H4N6 (6), H5N2 (3), H7N8 (1), and H10N6 (1) subtypes. All isolates were of low pathogenicity, as determined by the intravenous pathogenicity index of 0.00. For H5N2 and H7N8 isolates, the HA gene was sequenced and the phylogenetic analysis revealed possible ecologic connections of the Crimea region with AI viruses from Siberia and Europe. No influenza A isolates were recovered from other Anseriformes (diving ducks [two species of pochards] and graylag geese), Columbiformes (collared doves), Gruiformes (coot), and Galliformes (gray partridges).
601	20943331	Susceptibility of Muscovy (Cairina Moschata) and mallard ducks (Anas Platyrhynchos) to experimental infections by different genotypes of H5N1 avian influenza viruses.	Phuong do Q, Dung NT, Jorgensen PH, Handberg KJ, Vinh NT, Christensen JP	Vet Microbiol	 2011 Mar 24;148(2-4):168-74	 doi: 101016/jvetmic201009007 Epub 2010 Sep 16	It is a fact that in Viet Nam, Muscovy ducks are raised in large populations (approximately 8 million), usually kept in small flocks together with mallards and chickens. As a result, it is a great concern for epidemiologists to elucidate possible differences in relation to these species being exposed to infection with H5N1. To do this, an experimental study on infections with different genotypes of H5N1 in mallards and Muscovy ducks have been conducted, where it was found that the mortality of the inoculated Muscovy ducks was at least 80%, regardless of the virus strain employed. In contrast, the mortality of the mallards ranged from nil to 100%, which suggests that Muscovy ducks are more susceptible to HPAIV H5N1 infection in terms of disease development and mortality. It was also found that higher virus titers developed in vital organs of Muscovy ducks compared to mallards, particularly in the brain. Due to their high susceptibility, it is unlikely that Muscovy ducks act as a silent reservoir. The virus strains used in this study, to a certain degree, differed in their virulence properties to the bird species in question.
602	20939733	Eggshell permeability: a standard technique for determining interspecific rates of water vapor conductance.	Portugal SJ, Maurer G, Cassey P	Physiol Biochem Zool	 2010 Nov-Dec;83(6):1023-31	 doi: 101086/656287 Epub 2010 Oct 12	Typically, eggshell water vapor conductance is measured on whole eggs, freshly collected at the commencement of a study. At times, however, it may not be possible to obtain whole fresh eggs but rather egg fragments or previously blown eggs. Here we evaluate and describe in detail a technique for modern laboratory analysis of eggshell conductance that uses fragments from fresh and museum eggs to determine eggshell water vapor conductance. We used fresh unincubated eggs of domesticated chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), and guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) to investigate the reliability, validity, and repeatability of the technique. To assess the suitability of museum samples, museum and freshly collected black-headed gull eggs (Larus ridibundus) were used. Fragments were cut out of the eggshell from the blunt end (B), equator (E), and pointy end (P). Eggshell fragments were glued to the top of a 0.25-mL micro test tube (Eppendorf) filled with 200 muL of distilled water and placed in a desiccator at 25 degrees C. Eppendorfs were weighed three times at 24-h intervals, and mass loss was assumed to be a result of water evaporation. We report the following results: (1) mass loss between weighing sessions was highly repeatable and consistent in all species; (2) the majority of intraspecific variability in eggshell water vapor conductance between different eggs of the same species was explained through the differences in water vapor conductance between the three eggshell parts of the same egg (B, E, and P); (3) the technique was sensitive enough to detect significant differences between the three domestic species; (4) there was no overall significant difference between water vapor conductance of museum and fresh black-headed gull eggs; (5) there was no significant difference in water vapor conductance for egg fragments taken from the same egg both between different trials and within the same trial. We conclude, therefore, that this technique is an effective way of measuring interspecific water vapor conductance from eggshell fragments and that museum eggs are a suitable resource for such work.
603	20889822	Conditioning to magnetic direction in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).	Freire R, Birch TE	J Exp Biol	 2010 Oct 15;213(Pt 20):3423-6	 doi: 101242/jeb047613	The ability of ducks to derive magnetic direction information was tested in a conditioned procedure and the functional properties of the mechanism of magnetoreception investigated using common manipulations. Twelve ducks were trained to find a hidden imprinting stimulus behind one of three screens in a round arena. Once a criterion was reached, the directional choices of ducks were recorded in four treatments presented in a random order, separated with rewarded training trials to avoid extinction. In tests in the geomagnetic field, ducks preferred the screen in the training direction (P=0.005). In the crucial tests of magnetic orientation with the magnetic field experimentally shifted by 120 deg, ducks showed a significant difference in the choice for the correct magnetic direction between treatments (P=0.002). More specifically, they chose the correct magnetic direction more often than expected by chance (P=0.03), indicating that they were deriving directional information from the magnetic field. Ducks also chose the correct magnetic direction more often than expected by chance in tests with the shifted field after the upper bill was anaesthetised with lignocaine (P=0.05) or when the right eye was covered (P=0.005), indicating that these manipulations did not impair the ability to choose the correct magnetic direction. Thus, Pekin ducks can be conditioned to magnetic directions, and the results are consistent with the hypothesis that magnetic orientation is based on a chemical magnetoreception mechanism that is not restricted to the right eye.
604	20850473	Functional characterization of the CC chemokine RANTES from Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Arathy DS, Nair S, Soman SS, Issac A, Sreekumar E	Dev Comp Immunol	 2011 Jan;35(1):142-50	 doi: 101016/jdci201009005 Epub 2010 Sep 23	RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that belongs to the CC-group of chemokines. The present study was carried out to functionally characterize the previously identified RANTES homologue in domestic duck (GenBank Accession No. AY641435). Recombinant duck RANTES was expressed in Escherichia coli-based and HEK293T cell-based systems. A tRNA supplementation strategy was required to express the protein in E. coli due to the presence of rare codons. In biological assays using HEK293T cell-expressed protein, RANTES was found to mediate chemotaxis of DT-40 chicken B cells and primary duck splenocytes at a concentration of 0.505mug/ml (0.6muM). Immunostaining of the migrated splenocytes using anti-duck CD4 and CD8 monoclonal antibodies and subsequent flow cytometric analysis showed enhanced chemotaxis of CD8+ cells. The recombinant RANTES exhibited in vitro antiviral activity by inhibiting infection of chicken embryo fibroblast cells with duck enteritis virus (DEV) at the same concentration. The effect could be neutralized by rabbit anti-duck RANTES polyclonal serum. The mechanism seems to be direct on viral particles as evidenced by the need for co-incubation of RANTES with DEV prior to the infection for antiviral activity, and also by the enhanced binding of DEV to E. coli expressed purified RANTES on ELISA-based assays. Our results show that the duck RANTES has overlapping biological properties with its mammalian orthologue, and also has possible functional cross-reactivity with chicken immune cells indicated by the chemotaxis of DT-40 cells.
605	20843851	Maternal investment of female mallards is influenced by male carotenoid-based coloration.	Giraudeau M, Duval C, Czirjak GA, Bretagnolle V, Eraud C, McGraw KJ, Heeb P	Proc Biol Sci	 2011 Mar 7;278(1706):781-8	 doi: 101098/rspb20101115 Epub 2010 Sep 15	The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females modify their investment in a breeding attempt according to its reproductive value. One prediction of this hypothesis is that females will increase reproductive investment when mated to high-quality males. In birds, it was shown that females can modulate pre-hatch reproductive investment by manipulating egg and clutch sizes and/or the concentrations of egg internal compounds according to paternal attractiveness. However, the differential allocation of immune factors has seldom been considered, particularly with an experimental approach. The carotenoid-based ornaments can function as reliable signals of quality, indicating better immunity or ability to resist parasites. Thus, numerous studies show that females use the expression of carotenoid-based colour when choosing mates; but the influence of this paternal coloration on maternal investment decisions has seldom been considered and has only been experimentally studied with artificial manipulation of male coloration. Here, we used dietary carotenoid provisioning to manipulate male mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) bill coloration, a sexually selected trait, and followed female investment. We show that an increase of male bill coloration positively influenced egg mass and albumen lysozyme concentration. By contrast, yolk carotenoid concentration was not affected by paternal ornamentation. Maternal decisions highlighted in this study may influence chick survival and compel males to maintain carotenoid-based coloration from the mate-choice period until egg-laying has been finished.
606	20821613	Relating the ability of mallards to ingest high levels of sediment to potential contaminant exposure in waterfowl.	Heinz GH, Beyer WN, Hoffman DJ, Audet DJ	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2010 Jul;29(7):1621-4	 doi: 101002/etc174	When waterfowl feed from the bottom of bodies of water, they sometimes ingest sediments along with their food, and this sediment can be a major source of contaminants. Learning how much sediment waterfowl can consume in their diet and still maintain their health would be helpful in assessing potential threats from contaminants in sediment. In a controlled laboratory study the maximum tolerated percentage of sediment in the diet of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) was measured. When fed a well-balanced commercial avian diet, 50, 60, or 70% sediment in the diet on a dry-weight basis did not cause weight loss over a two-week period. Ducks fed this same commercial diet, but containing 80 or 90% sediment, lost 8.6 and 15.6% of their body weight, respectively, in the first week on those diets. After factoring in the ability of the mallards to sieve out some of the sediment from their diet before swallowing it, we concluded that the mallards could maintain their health even when approximately half of what they swallowed, on a dry-weight basis, was sediment.
607	20821543	Intraperitoneal injections as a possible means of generating varied levels of methylmercury in the eggs of birds in field studies.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2010 May;29(5):1079-83	 doi: 101002/etc128	The ideal study of the effects of methylmercury on the reproductive success of a species of bird would be one in which eggs contained mercury concentrations ranging from controls to very heavily contaminated, all at the same site. Such a study cannot be realized at a Hg-contaminated area or under laboratory conditions but could be achieved by introducing methylmercury into breeding females and allowing them to deposit Hg in their eggs. Female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were intraperitoneally injected with solutions of methylmercury chloride dissolved in corn oil, propylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, mineral oil, Olestra, Crisco, lard, hard paraffin, and a combination of hard and soft paraffin. In some cases, egg laying was delayed, as a result of either the solvent itself (in the case of Olestra, Crisco, and lard) or the highest concentration of methylmercury chloride (500 microg/g) in some of the solvents. Mercury in eggs ranged from a control level (<0.1 microg/g) to approximately 14 microg/g on a wet weight basis, which more than covers the range of concentrations reported in wild bird eggs. Mercury concentrations in a series of eggs from the same female declined mostly as a result of excretion of Hg in prior eggs and not because of the length of time since the injection. Intraperitoneal injections hold promise in field studies in which one would like to study the reproductive effects of a wide range of methylmercury levels in the eggs of a wild bird and under the natural conditions that exist in the field.
608	20821490	Enhanced reproduction in mallards fed a low level of methylmercury: an apparent case of hormesis.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2010 Mar;29(3):650-3	 doi: 101002/etc64	Breeding pairs of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed a control diet or a diet containing 0.5 microg/g mercury (Hg) in the form of methylmercury chloride. There were no effects of Hg on adult weights and no overt signs of Hg poisoning in adults. The Hg-containing diet had no effect on fertility of eggs, but hatching success of eggs was significantly higher for females fed 0.5 microg/g Hg (71.8%) than for controls (57.5%). Survival of ducklings through 6 d of age was the same (97.8%) for controls and mallards fed 0.5 microg/g mercury. However, the mean number of ducklings produced per female was significantly higher for the pairs fed 0.5 microg/g Hg (21.4) than for controls (16.8). Although mercury in the parents' diet had no effect on mean duckling weights at hatching, ducklings from parents fed 0.5 microg/g Hg weighed significantly more (mean = 87.2 g) at 6 d of age than did control ducklings (81.0 g). The mean concentration of Hg in eggs laid by parents fed 0.5 microg/g mercury was 0.81 microg/g on a wet-weight basis. At this time, one cannot rule out the possibility that low concentrations of Hg in eggs may be beneficial, and this possibility should be considered when setting regulatory thresholds for methylmercury.
609	20821458	Predicting mercury concentrations in mallard eggs from mercury in the diet or blood of adult females and from duckling down feathers.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2010 Feb;29(2):389-392	 doi: 101002/etc50	Measurements of Hg concentrations in avian eggs can be used to predict possible harm to reproduction, but it is not always possible to sample eggs. When eggs cannot be sampled, some substitute tissue, such as female blood, the diet of the breeding female, or down feathers of hatchlings, must be used. When female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed diets containing methylmercury chloride, the concentration of Hg in a sample of their blood was closely correlated with the concentration of Hg in the egg they laid the day they were bled (r2 = 0.88; p < 0.001). Even when the blood sample was taken more than two weeks after an egg was laid, there was a strong correlation between Hg concentrations in female blood and eggs (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.0002). When we plotted the dietary concentrations of Hg we fed to the egg-laying females against the concentrations of Hg in their eggs, the r2 value was 0.96 (p < 0.0001). When the concentrations of Hg in the down feathers of newly hatched ducklings were plotted against Hg in the whole ducklings, the r2 value was 0.99 (p < 0.0003). Although measuring Hg in eggs may be the most direct way of predicting possible embryotoxicity, our findings demonstrate that measuring Hg in the diet of breeding birds, in the blood of egg-laying females, or in down feathers of hatchlings all can be used to estimate what concentration of Hg may have been in the egg.
610	20723979	Effects of dietary cadmium contamination on bird Anas platyrhynchos--comparison with species Cairina moschata.	Lucia M, Andre JM, Gonzalez P, Baudrimont M, Bernadet MD, Gontier K, Maury-Brachet R, Guy G, Davail S	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	 2010 Nov;73(8):2010-6	 doi: 101016/jecoenv201007029 Epub 2010 Aug 17	This study aimed to assess the effect of two dietary cadmium (Cd) levels (C1: 1 mgkg(-1); C10: 10 mgkg(-1)) on bird Anas platyrhynchos exposed for 10, 20 and 40 days (5 animals per experimental condition). Ducks were able to accumulate high amounts of Cd, especially in kidneys (after 40 days: C1 8.1 +/- 1 mgkg(-1), C10 37.7 +/- 4.3 mgkg(-1)). After 40 days, the lowest Cd level triggered oxidative stress and stimulated mitochondrial metabolism. At the same time, highest amounts of Cd (C10 group) only triggered repression of genes encoding for catalase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, with repression factors of 1/50 and 1/5, respectively. High dose exposures were then associated with the repression of genes encoding for antioxidant, whereas low dose exposure triggered their induction. In contrast, the onset of MT gene expression appeared quickly for the C10 group even if a time delay was observed between gene expression and protein accumulation. Through the comparison of A. platyrhynchos and Cairina moschata, the response to Cd toxicity appeared species-dependent. Discrepancies between species could be explained by differential utilization of MT. This pathway of detoxification seemed sufficient to counter Cd toxicity.
611	20688691	Lead toxicity in captive and wild Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in Spain.	Rodriguez JJ, Oliveira PA, Fidalgo LE, Ginja MM, Silvestre AM, Ordonez C, Serantes AE, Gonzalo-Orden JM, Orden MA	J Wildl Dis	 2010 Jul;46(3):854-63	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-463854	Forty captive Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), of both sexes, were separated into five groups and dosed with lead shot via oral intubation; one group was used as a control. Lead dosage differed in terms of shot number and size, as well as administration time. One hundred and thirty-five wild mallards were trapped between 1998 and 2001 in the Boada and Nava lagoons near the Canal de Castilla, in the Spanish province of Palencia. Radiologic techniques (ventrodorsal and lateral views) were used to detect lead shot in the gizzard and to determine degradation in dosed birds over time. Heparinized blood samples were taken from wild and captive mallards and blood lead levels were determined using anodic stripping voltammetry with a dropping mercury electrode. Clinical signs, injuries, and body weight were recorded. In approximately 90% of the experimentally dosed mallards, administered shot stayed in their gizzard until it degraded; this took approximately 30 days. Peak lead levels in blood were observed between days 10 and 20, and 10 days following a repeat dosage; males were more sensitive than females to a repeat dosage. During the experimental phase, 34% of birds died, and those that survived had varying degrees of anorexia, lethargy, and a decreased response to external stimulus. Of 135 tested wild mallards, 41% had a blood lead concentration higher than 0.200 microg/g. Lead shot was found embedded in 3.6% of the wild birds and 1.2% had a lead shot pellet in their gizzard.
612	20688643	Relationships between local carcass density and risk of mortality in molting mallards during avian botulism outbreaks.	Evelsizer DD, Clark RG, Bollinger TK	J Wildl Dis	 2010 Apr;46(2):507-13	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-462507	Removal of bird carcasses has been advocated for management of Clostridium botulinum outbreaks on lakes in North America because a reduction in density of toxin-laden maggots produced within bird carcasses is assumed to enhance survival of healthy birds. This inverse relationship between carcass density and survival has been reported in controlled studies with Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) but has not been verified in wild ducks during naturally occurring botulism outbreaks. Therefore, we radio-marked 204 molting Mallards on seven lakes in western Canada during July-August 1999-2000, and monitored their survival daily for 30 days. Carcass searches were conducted simultaneously at 90 matched locations for freshly dead and randomly selected live radio-marked Mallards. Carcass density (carcasses/ha) averaged about two times greater at dead than at live duck locations (x = 12.4, SE= 1.2 vs. x= 5.0, SE= 0.7). Predicted risk of mortality increased rapidly with carcass density (case-control logistic regression: model-averaged beta(density)= 0.167, unconditional SE= 0.062). Mallards exposed to 5-11 and >11 carcasses/ ha were 3.5 and 13 times more likely to die, respectively, than were Mallards inhabiting carcass-free areas. Mortality risk was more closely related to density of maggot-laden carcasses than to maggot-free carcass densities. Our results are consistent with the assumption that reducing carcass density could enhance survival. However, we caution that survival rates may remain low on lakes in which areas with high carcass densities persist due to incomplete carcass removal.
613	20674751	Origin and genetic diversity of Chinese domestic ducks.	Li HF, Zhu WQ, Song WT, Shu JT, Han W, Chen KW	Mol Phylogenet Evol	 2010 Nov;57(2):634-40	 doi: 101016/jympev201007011 Epub 2010 Jul 30	China is particularly rich in duck genetic resources. In order to reveal the genetic diversity and origin of Chinese domestic duck, the 667 bp control region of mitochondrial DNA of 238 domestic ducks from 26 indigenous breeds, 25 wild mallards and nine spot-billed ducks were sequenced and analyzed them together with the published data for 12 mallards and nine spot-billed ducks. The haplotype diversity (Hd, 0.645) and average nucleotide diversity (Pi, 0.115%) indicate low genetic diversity of Chinese domestic ducks. The NJ phylogenetic tree and reduced median-joining network chart were constructed using a total of 72 haplotypes. The genetic contribution of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) can be detected in most of Chinese indigenous duck breeds and that of spot-billed duck (Anas zonorhyncha) can also be detected in few Chinese indigenous duck breeds. The results indicated that the Chinese domestic ducks mainly derived from mallard (A. platyrhynchos) and few derived from spot-billed duck (A. zonorhyncha).
614	20662829	Models for estimating abundance from repeated counts of an open metapopulation.	Dail D, Madsen L	Biometrics	 2011 Jun;67(2):577-87	 doi: 101111/j1541-0420201001465x Epub 2010 Jul 21	Using only spatially and temporally replicated point counts, Royle (2004b, Biometrics 60, 108-115) developed an N-mixture model to estimate the abundance of an animal population when individual animal detection probability is unknown. One assumption inherent in this model is that the animal populations at each sampled location are closed with respect to migration, births, and deaths throughout the study. In the past this has been verified solely by biological arguments related to the study design as no statistical verification was available. In this article, we propose a generalization of the N-mixture model that can be used to formally test the closure assumption. Additionally, when applied to an open metapopulation, the generalized model provides estimates of population dynamics parameters and yields abundance estimates that account for imperfect detection probability and do not require the closure assumption. A simulation study shows these abundance estimates are less biased than the abundance estimate obtained from the original N-mixture model. The proposed model is then applied to two data sets of avian point counts. The first example demonstrates the closure test on a single-season study of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and the second uses the proposed model to estimate the population dynamics parameters and yearly abundance of American robins (Turdus migratorius) from a multi-year study.
615	20653279	Wintering French mallard and teal are heavier and in better body condition than 30 years ago: effects of a changing environment-	Guillemain M, Elmberg J, Gauthier-Clerc M, Massez G, Hearn R, Champagnon J, Simon G	Ambio	 2010 Mar;39(2):170-80	 doi: 101007/s13280-010-0020-9	Animal populations are exposed to large-scale anthropogenic impact from, e.g., climate change, habitat alteration and supplemental stocking. All of these may affect body condition in wintering dabbling ducks, which in turn may affect an individual's survival and reproductive success. The aim of this study was to assess whether there have been morphometric changes in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Teal (Anas crecca) over the last 30 years at a major wintering site. Body mass and condition increased from the 1950s-1960s to the 2000s in both species. The increase in body mass amounted to as much as 11.7%, with no corresponding change in body size. Improved body condition was maintained from early to mid-winter, but then converged with historical values for late winter. Our interpretation is that increasingly benign ambient winter conditions permit ducks to maintain better energetic "safety margins" throughout winter, and that converging spring departure values may be related to evolutionary flight energetic optima. The observed changes are consistent with large-scale climate amelioration and local/regional habitat improvement (both anthropogenic).
616	20637173	Relationships between dietary carotenoids, body tissue carotenoids, parasite burden, and health state in wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings.	Butler MW, McGraw KJ	Arch Biochem Biophys	 2010 Dec 1;504(1):154-60	 doi: 101016/jabb201007003 Epub 2010 Jul 14	While rodents and other mammals have traditionally served as models for studying carotenoid physiology, many wild animals from a variety of other taxa utilize carotenoids for self-maintenance and reproduction and accumulate far greater concentrations than those found in mammals. Though we have basic understandings of the control and value of carotenoids in some wild animal systems, many gaps remain. For example, parasites and pathogens impose severe survival constraints on free-ranging organisms, but little is known of how carotenoids work in concert with the immune system to combat natural infectious challenges. Furthermore, due to the high mortality rate from which many young animals suffer, health and carotenoid status during the early stages of development may be critical to survival. The relative importance of dietary versus physiological mechanisms for carotenoid uptake has also been understudied in the wild. To begin to shed light on these issues, we studied relationships between dietary and tissue carotenoids, hematological immune parameters, and endoparasitism of wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings at a variety of ages. Lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, beta-carotene, and canthaxanthin were the most common carotenoids in liver, plasma, and gut contents. We found that, early in development (when food intake is limited), carotenoids were comparatively concentrated in internal tissue (e.g., liver), presumably a carry-over from maternal contributions in yolk, but as ducklings approached independence (and increasingly fed on their own) concentrations were greatest in gut contents. Canthaxanthin concentrations were lower in the plasma and liver of older individuals compared to younger ducklings, even though gut canthaxanthin concentration did not change with age. Additionally, beta-carotene was nearly absent from circulation, despite moderate levels within the gut, suggesting a high rate of conversion to retinol. Using principal components analysis, we revealed a correlation between an increased ability to assimilate dietary carotenoids and lower levels of chronic stress (as assessed by lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios) and a correlation between a reduced carotenoid status and increased investment in the immune system (as assessed by higher total leukocyte count). We also found that individuals without parasites had an overall reduced carotenoid status. Thus, we demonstrate age-specific differences in carotenoid allocation in growing animals from a precocial bird species and provide correlational evidence that parasitism and health in wild animals are related to carotenoid status and assimilation ability.
617	20567986	The mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) as intermediate host for Sarcocystis wobeseri sp. nov. from the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis).	Kutkiene L, Prakas P, Sruoga A, Butkauskas D	Parasitol Res	 2010 Sep;107(4):879-88	 doi: 101007/s00436-010-1945-4 Epub 2010 Jun 22	Morphometric and DNA investigation results of Sarcocystis wobeseri sp. nov. from the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type IV) from the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) are presented. No significant morphometric differences between the investigated Sarcocystis species were found. ITS-1, 18S rRNA, and 28S rRNA gene sequences of these species showed 100% identity. The conclusion is drawn that it is one and the same Sarcocystis species in different intermediate hosts.
618	20556426	Final hosts and variability of Trichobilharzia regenti under natural conditions.	Jouet D, Skirnisson K, Kolarova L, Ferte H	Parasitol Res	 2010 Sep;107(4):923-30	 doi: 101007/s00436-010-1953-4 Epub 2010 Jun 17	In Europe, despite of intensive work on avian schistosomes in the past, only one representative of nasal schistosomes has been detected so far, Trichobilharzia regenti, a species that remained undescribed to the scientific community until 1998. Since then, however, T. regenti has gained a considerable attention, not only due to the induction of serious lesions concomitant with the migration of the schistosomulae through the central nervous system of their natural hosts (birds) but also due to their implication in cercarial dermatitis and their neurotrophic behaviour in mammals (mice, experimental) where the parasite migrate to the CNS. From 2001 to 2010, by a parasitic control of various potential final hosts (aquatic birds) living in natural condition in France and in Iceland, we detected T. regenti in six species: Anas platyrhynchos, Cygnus olor, Aythya fuligula, Aythya ferina, Mergus merganser and Anser anser. Although morphological features, mainly of eggs, showed some variations with the original description of the parasite, molecular analysis confirmed their membership to the T. regenti species. Nevertheless, specific molecular and morphological variations were especially observed for nasal parasite isolated from Anas clypeata. For this species, we discuss the possibility for this nasal schistosome to belong to a nasal Trichobilharzia species already described in Africa or even an undescribed nasal species.
619	20541945	MyoD expression profile and developmental differences of leg and breast muscle in Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos Domestica) during embryonic to neonatal stages.	Li L, Liu HH, Xu F, Si JM, Jia J, Wang JW	Micron	 2010 Oct;41(7):847-52	 doi: 101016/jmicron201004016 Epub 2010 May 5	In order to investigate the developmental differences between the duck breast muscle and leg muscle tissues during the embryonic stage to neonatal stages, as well as the expression profile of MyoD between the two muscle tissues, the morphologic characteristics in the two muscle tissues during duck embryo stages at E14, E18, E22, E27 and D7 were compared through the muscle paraffin sections. The coding domain sequence of duck MyoD gene was cloned, and then the expression of MyoD in duck leg muscle and breast muscle during embryo stage on E10, E14, E18, E22, E27 and D7 was detected using qRT-PCR method. Results showed that the developmental status of the duck breast muscle in embryonic phrases lag behind that of leg muscle. The CDS of duck MyoD gene consists of 894 nucleotides, and showed relatively high similarity with the gene of other species. The MyoD mRNA expressed in both kinds of muscle tissues and the expression profile had a similar trend, although the expression level of MyoD in the breast muscle was significantly higher than that in the leg muscle at each developmental stages (p<0.05). Results suggested that MyoD might have potential functions in controlling muscle fiber phenotype during the secondary myogenesis of muscle development. These fundamental works may provide some valuable clues for knowing the roles of MyoD in the myogenesis and the muscle fiber type differentiation in birds.
620	20529248	Proteomic analysis of primary duck hepatocytes infected with duck hepatitis B virus.	Zhao Y, Ben H, Qu S, Zhou X, Yan L, Xu B, Zhou S, Lou Q, Ye R, Zhou T, Yang P, Qu D	Proteome Sci	 2010 Jun 7;8:28	 doi: 101186/1477-5956-8-28	BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of liver infection in human. Because of the lack of an appropriate cell culture system for supporting HBV infection efficiently, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus infection remain incompletely understood. Duck heptatitis B virus (DHBV) can naturally infect primary duck hepatocytes (PDHs) that provide valuable model systems for studying hepadnavirus infection in vitro. In this report, we explored global changes in cellular protein expression in DHBV infected PDHs by two-dimension gel electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). RESULTS: The effects of hepadnavirus infection on hepatocytes were investigated in DHBV infected PDHs by the 2-DE analysis. Proteomic profile of PDHs infected with DHBV were analyzed at 24, 72 and 120 h post-infection by comparing with uninfected PDHs, and 75 differentially expressed protein spots were revealed by 2-DE analysis. Among the selected protein spots, 51 spots were identified corresponding to 42 proteins by MS/MS analysis; most of them were matched to orthologous proteins of Gallus gallus, Anas platyrhynchos or other avian species, including alpha-enolase, lamin A, aconitase 2, cofilin-2 and annexin A2, etc. The down-regulated expression of beta-actin and annexin A2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and potential roles of some differentially expressed proteins in the virus-infected cells have been discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Differentially expressed proteins of DHBV infected PDHs revealed by 2-DE, are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, stress responses and cytoskeleton processes etc, providing the insight to understanding of interactions between hepadnavirus and hepatocytes and molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus pathogenesis.
621	20521714	Application of DNA barcoding technique in avian influenza virus surveillance of wild bird habitats in Korea and Mongolia.	Lee DH, Lee HJ, Lee YN, Lee YJ, Jeong OM, Kang HM, Kim MC, Kwon JS, Kwon JH, Lee JB, Park SY, Choi IS, Song CS	Avian Dis	 2010 Mar;54(1 Suppl):677-81	 doi: 101637/8783-040109-ResNote1	In a previous study, we optimized DNA barcoding techniques for avian influenza virus (AIV) isolation and host identification, using fecal samples from wild birds, for high-throughput surveillance of migratory waterfowls. In the present study, we surveyed AIV in Mongolia during the breeding season and, subsequently, in Korea in winter, to compare prevalent AIV subtypes and hosts using DNA barcoding. In Korea, H4 and H5 subtypes were the most abundantly detected HA subtypes, and most AIVs were isolated from the major population (mallards, Anas platyrhynchos) of wild bird habitats. On the other hand, in Mongolia, H3 and H4 subtypes were the most abundantly detected HA subtypes, and most AIVs were isolated from a small population of wild bird habitats that were not visible at the sampling site. In conclusion, AIV isolation using fecal samples, accompanied with DNA barcoding techniques as a host bird species identification tool, could be useful for monitoring major and minor populations of wild bird habitats. Further, continuous, and large-scale surveillance could be helpful for understanding the AIV epidemiology, evolution, and ecology in wild waterfowl.
622	20521698	The effect of age on avian influenza viral shedding in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Costa TP, Brown JD, Howerth EW, Stallknecht DE	Avian Dis	 2010 Mar;54(1 Suppl):581-5	 doi: 101637/8692-031309-ResNote1	Avian influenza virus (AIV) prevalence in wild aquatic bird populations varies with season, geographic location, host species, and age. It is not clear how age at infection affects the extent of viral shedding. To better understand the influence of age at infection on viral shedding of wild bird-origin low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of increasing age (2 wk, 1 mo, 2 mo, 3 mo, and 4 mo) were experimentally inoculated via choanal cleft with a 10(6) median embryo infectious dose (EID50) of either A/Mallard/MN/355779/00 (H5N2) or A/Mallard/MN/199106/99 (H3N8). Exposed birds in all five age groups were infected by both AIV isolates and excreted virus via the oropharynx and cloaca. The 1-month and older groups consistently shed virus from 1 to 4 d post inoculation (dpi), whereas, viral shedding was delayed by 1 d in the 2-wk-old group. Past 4 dpi, viral shedding in all groups varied between individual birds, but virus was isolated from some birds in each group up to 21 dpi when the trial was terminated. The 1-mo-old group had the most productive shedding with a higher number of cloacal swabs that tested positive for virus over the study period and lower cycle threshold values on real-time reverse-transcription PCR. The viral shedding pattern observed in this study suggests that, although mallards from different age groups can become infected and shed LPAI viruses, age at time of infection might have an effect on the extent of viral shedding and thereby impact transmission of LPAI viruses within the wild bird reservoir system. This information may help us better understand the natural history of these viruses, interpret field and experimental data, and plan future experimental trials.

The lake is the largest freshwater body in China and a significant congregation site for waterfowl; however, surrounding rice fields and poultry grazing have created an overlap with wild waterbirds, a situation conducive to avian influenza transmission. Reports of HPAI H5N1 in healthy wild ducks at Poyang Lake have raised concerns about the potential of resilient free-ranging birds to disseminate the virus. Yet the role wild ducks play in connecting regions of HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Asia is hindered by a lack of information about their migratory ecology. During 2007-08 we marked wild ducks at Poyang Lake with satellite transmitters to examine the location and timing of spring migration and identify any spatiotemporal relationship with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. Species included the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), northern pintail (Anas acuta), common teal (Anas crecca), falcated teal (Anas falcata), Baikal teal (Anas formosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), garganey (Anas querquedula), and Chinese spotbill (Anas poecilohyncha). These wild ducks (excluding the resident mallard and Chinese spotbill ducks) followed the East Asian Flyway along the coast to breeding areas in northern China, eastern Mongolia, and eastern Russia. None migrated west toward Qinghai Lake (site of the largest wild bird epizootic), thus failing to demonstrate any migratory connection to the Central Asian Flyway. A newly developed Brownian bridge spatial analysis indicated that HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported in the flyway were related to latitude and poultry density but not to the core migration corridor or to wetland habitats. Also, we found a temporal mismatch between timing of outbreaks and wild duck movements. These analyses depend on complete or representative reporting of outbreaks, but by documenting movements of wild waterfowl, we present ecological knowledge that better informs epidemiological investigations seeking to explain and predict the spread of avian influenza viruses.
624	20521677	Avian influenza viruses isolated from mallards in Bulgaria.	Goujgoulova G, Petkova AM, Georgiev G	Avian Dis	 2010 Mar;54(1 Suppl):450-2	 doi: 101637/8681-030709-ResNote1	Bulgaria has a unique geographic position in Europe, with two migratory wild bird routes, Via Pontica and Via Aristotelis, passing through the country. Via Pontica is the second-largest migration route in Europe, with hundreds of thousands of birds, representing more than 110 species, wintering in lakes by the Black Sea and the wetlands near the Danube River. Via Aristotelis is situated in West Bulgaria along the Strouma and Mesta river valleys, and it is of regional importance for the Balkan Peninsula. In this study, we examined more than 2000 samples from wild birds from the orders Anseriformes, Ciconiiformes, Gruiformes, and Charadriformes in the period 2006-2008. We isolated three influenza viruses, subtypes H4N6, H7N7, and H10N7, all from mallards, Anas platyrhynchos. The H7N7 was isolated from a hunter-killed mallard at the river bank of Kamchia (Via Pontica). The cleavage site sequence of the hemagglutinin gene in the H7N7 isolate was PEIPKGR*GLF, which is characteristic of a low-pathogenic virus. The H4N6 isolates belonged to a mallard wintering along the Maritza River (Via Aristotelis). We detected the H10N7 virus in samples from mallards that inhabit the Ogosta River, one of the feeders of the Danube (Via Pontica). All these viruses were detected during the active migration of the birds, February-March.
625	20521670	Low pathogenicity avian influenza subtypes isolated from wild birds in the United States, 2006-2008.	Pedersen K, Swafford SR, DeLiberto TJ	Avian Dis	 2010 Mar;54(1 Suppl):405-10	 doi: 101637/8693-031309-Reg1	Due to concerns that high pathogenicity avian influenza would enter into the United States, an interagency strategic plan was developed to conduct surveillance in wild birds in order to address one of the possible pathways of entry. The USDA and state wildlife agencies participated in this effort by collecting samples from 145,055 wild birds from April 2006 through March 2008 in all 50 states. The majority (59%) of all wild bird samples was collected from dabbling ducks, and 91% of H5 detections using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were in dabbling ducks. Apparent prevalence of H5 by rRT-PCR in all birds sampled was 0.38%. Most (48%) H5 detections were found in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Thirty-three virus subtypes were identified; H5N2 was the most prevalent subtype and accounted for 40% of all virus isolations. We present the virus subtypes obtained from the national surveillance effort and compare them with research results published from various countries.
626	20521652	Phylogenetic analysis of influenza A viruses (H6N8, H1N8, H4N2, H9N2, H10N7) isolated from wild birds, ducks, and ostriches in South Africa from 2007 to 2009.	Abolnik C, Gerdes GH, Sinclair M, Ganzevoort BW, Kitching JP, Burger CE, Romito M, Dreyer M, Swanepoel S, Cumming GS, Olivier AJ	Avian Dis	 2010 Mar;54(1 Suppl):313-22	 doi: 101637/8781-040109-Reg1	Influenza A strains emerging from wild birds are a constant threat to South Africa's valuable ostrich industry. In 2004 and again in 2006, low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 strains introduced from a wild bird reservoir mutated in ostriches to high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI), with serious economic consequences and export bans imposed by the European Union. Although no outbreaks of notifiable avian influenza have occurred in South Africa since 2006, the H9N2 virus caused a localized outbreak where ostriches displayed symptoms of green urine, depression, and mild morbidity. Most recently, an outbreak of H10N7 in farmed Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) caused increased mortalities, but this was exacerbated by a secondary Escherichia coli infection, because an intravenous pathogenicity index of 0.00 was recorded. Each of the eight gene segments of the five strains isolated from 2007 to 2009 from farmed ostriches in the Oudtshoorn region (H6N8, H9N2), Pekin ducks (H10N7, Joostenburgvlakte region), and wild Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegypticus; H1N8, Baberspan wetlands; H4N2, Oudtshoorn region) were sequenced, genetically analyzed, and compared to previous South African isolates and viruses in the public data banks. An H5N8 strain was also detected by reverse-transcription PCR in cloacal swabs from swift terns (Sterna bergii) in the Mosselbaai region during 2007, although a virus could not be isolated. Initial phylogenetic results indicate that H6N8 and H9N2 ostrich and H10N7 Pekin duck viruses originated in the wild bird population that is geographically dispersed throughout southern Africa, based on the reassortment of viral genes from birds sampled outside of the ostrich farming areas. No evidence of internal genes associated with Asian HPAI H5N1 strains were detected in the South African isolates.
627	20514747	Tissue tropism of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 in naturally infected mute swans (Cygnus Olor ), domestic geese (Aser Anser var. domestica), pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and mulard ducks ( Cairina moschata x anas platyrhynchos).	Szeredi L, Dan A, Palmai N, Ursu K, Balint A, Szeleczky Z, Ivanics E, Erdelyi K, Rigo D, Tekes L, Glavits R	Acta Vet Hung	 2010 Mar;58(1):133-45	 doi: 101556/AVet582010114	The 2006 epidemic due to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 in Hungary caused the most severe losses in waterfowl which were, according to the literature at the time, supposed to be the most resistant to this pathogen. The presence of pathological lesions and the amount of viral antigen were quantified by gross pathology, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the organs of four waterfowl species [mute swans (n = 10), domestic geese (n = 6), mulard ducks (n = 6) and Pekin ducks (n = 5)] collected during the epidemic. H5N1 subtype HPAIV was isolated from all birds examined. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR) was also applied on a subset of samples [domestic geese (n = 3), mulard (n = 4) and Pekin duck (n = 4)] in order to compare its sensitivity with IHC. Viral antigen was detected by IHC in all cases. However, the overall presence of viral antigen in tissue samples was quite variable: virus antigen was present in 56/81 (69%) swan, 22/38 (58%) goose, 28/46 (61%) mulard duck and 5/43 (12%) Pekin duck tissue samples. HPAIV subtype H5N1 was detected by qRRT-PCR in all birds examined, in 19/19 (100%) goose, 7/28 (25%) mulard duck and 12/28 (43%) Pekin duck tissue samples. As compared to qRRTPCR, the IHC was less sensitive in geese and Pekin ducks but more sensitive in mulard ducks. The IHC was consistently positive above 4.31 log10 copies/reaction but it gave very variable results below that level. Neurotropism of the isolated virus strains was demonstrated by finding the largest amount of viral antigen and the highest average RNA load in the brain in all four waterfowl species examined.
628	20496959	Morphologic and molecular characterization of the sarcocysts of Sarcocystis rileyi (Apicomplexa: Sarcocystidae) from the mallard duck ( Anas platyrhynchos ).	Dubey JP, Rosenthal BM, Felix TA	J Parasitol	 2010 Aug;96(4):765-70	 doi: 101645/GE-24131	Macroscopic sarcocysts are often observed in ducks, but at present their taxonomic status remains uncertain because ducks serve as intermediate hosts for several such parasites in the genus Sarcocystis . One such species, Sarcocystis rileyi , was long ago established to involve the northern shoveler duck ( Anas clypeata ) and the striped skunk ( Mephitis mephitis ) as its intermediate and definitive hosts, respectively. Here, we employed light microscopy, electron microscopy, and DNA sequencing to more precisely describe diagnostic attributes of parasites presumed to represent S. rileyi occurring in a naturally-infected mallard duck ( Anas platyrhynchos ). By light and transmission electron microscopy, sarcocysts from the mallard duck resembled the S. rileyi described from A. clypeata . We document 18S, ITS-1, and 28S rDNA sequences from the mallard duck, the first for S. rileyi from any host. Sequences of conserved and variable portions of nuclear ribosomal DNA indicated that S. rileyi is related to, but distinct from, parasites employing opossums as their definitive host (including Sarcocystis neurona and Sarcocystis falcatula ). Diagnostic ultrastructural features and nucleotide sequences should aid in future studies and communications regarding this parasitic taxon, which lends itself to experimentation because its sarcocysts are macroscopic and easily excised from infected birds.
629	20496603	Development of an avian brachial plexus nerve block technique for perioperative analgesia in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Brenner DJ, Larsen RS, Dickinson PJ, Wack RF, Williams DC, Pascoe PJ	J Avian Med Surg	 2010 Mar;24(1):24-34	 doi: 101647/1082-6742-24124	Surgical procedures of the wing are commonly performed in companion, captive, and wild avian species. To develop a clinically applicable brachial plexus nerve block technique for perioperative analgesia in birds, 8 adult female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were anesthetized and used in several local anesthetic trials with bupivacaine (2 or 8 mg/kg) or a combination of lidocaine (15 mg/kg) and epinephrine (3.8 microg/kg) perineurally; equal volumes of saline were administered as control treatments. Both axillary and dorsal approaches to the brachial plexus were evaluated. With the axillary approach, radial and ulnar compound nerve action potentials (CNAP), sensory nerve conduction velocities (SNCVs), and cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) were recorded after distal sensory nerve stimulation. Values were recorded before and at 5, 30, and 60 minutes after injection of local anesthetic or saline. Birds were monitored for the presence of a wing droop and a change in motor function on recovery from anesthesia. Results were highly variable for all techniques. No technique significantly decreased CDPs or resulted in consistent wing droop. Radial and ulnar CNAPs, SNCVs, and CDPs were consistently recorded in all birds. Variable results might indicate that the treatment, concentration, or volume of local anesthetic used was ineffective in producing local anesthesia. Electrodiagnostic methods used in these ducks to assess loss of sensory nerve conduction might not be sensitive enough to assess the effects of local anesthesia. Further research is needed to identify methods for assessing the efficacy of brachial plexus nerve blockade in birds.
630	20454557	The increase of Lactobacillus species in the gut flora of newborn broiler chicks and ducks is associated with weight gain.	Angelakis E, Raoult D	PLoS One	 2010 May 4;5(5):e10463	 doi: 101371/journalpone0010463	BACKGROUND: A bacterial role in the obesity pandemic has been suspected based on the ingestion of probiotics that can modify the gut flora. The objective of our study was to determine if increased Lactobacillus sp. in the gut flora of newborn broiler chicks and ducks could result in weight gain increase. METHODOLOGY: Female broiler chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) were separated into one control and two experimental groups, and inoculated once or twice with 4x10(10)Lactobacillus spp. per animal in PBS, or with PBS alone. Fecal samples were collected before and at 24 hours, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 30 days after the inoculation. DNA was extracted from the stools, and qPCR assays were performed on a MX3000 system for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus sp., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, using a quantification plasmid. Animals were measured and sacrificed 60 days after the beginning of the experiment, and livers were collected and measured. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Chicks inoculated once and twice with Lactobacillus weighed 10.2% (p = 0.0162) and 13.5% (p = 0.0064) more than the control group animals, respectively. Similarly, ducks inoculated once and twice weighed 7.7% (p = 0.05) and 14% (p = 0.035) more than those in the control group, respectively. Liver mass was also significantly higher in inoculated animals compared to the control group. Inoculation with Lactobacillus sp. increased the DNA copies of Lactobacillus spp. and Firmicutes in the stools. Bacteroidetes remained stable, and only the second Lactobacillus sp. inoculation significantly decreased its population in chicks. The ratio of DNA copies of Firmicutes to those of Bacteroidetes increased to as much as 6,4 in chicks and 8,3 in ducks. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the intestinal microbiota may precede weight increase, as we found that an increase of Lactobacillus sp. in newborn ducks and chicks preceded the development of weight gain.
631	20437221	Effects of access to preen gland secretions on mallard plumage.	Giraudeau M, Duval C, Guillon N, Bretagnolle V, Gutierrez C, Heeb P	Naturwissenschaften	 2010 Jun;97(6):577-81	 doi: 101007/s00114-010-0673-z Epub 2010 May 2	Preen glands exist in almost every bird species and several non-exclusive functions have been proposed for this gland and the oils that it produces. One function generally admitted is that the oily secretions of the preen gland would provide a waterproofing layer when spread over feathers. Alternatively, several authors have proposed that plumage waterproofness is mostly due to the spatial micro-structure of feathers. The purpose of this study was to examine, by manipulating the access to the preen gland, the effect of the preen oil on the plumage waterproofness and condition. To explore this question, we carried out two independent experiments where we temporarily blocked access to the preen gland secretions with a removable mechanism in one group of captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), whilst a second group of birds had access to gland secretions. In a long-term experiment (3 months of treatment) and a short-term experiment (10 days), we measured plumage water retention and condition. After 3 months without access to preen glands, we found a significant decrease of plumage condition and an associated increase in plumage water retention. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between plumage condition and water retention ability. In contrast, after 10 days of treatment, no significant effect was found on plumage condition and water retention. Our study shows that preen oil acts to maintain plumage condition and suggests that feather microstructure is essential to maintain plumage waterproofness.
632	20417034	Molecular and biological characteristics of Toxoplasma gondii isolates from wildlife in France.	Aubert D, Ajzenberg D, Richomme C, Gilot-Fromont E, Terrier ME, de Gevigney C, Game Y, Maillard D, Gibert P, Darde ML, Villena I	Vet Parasitol	 2010 Aug 4;171(3-4):346-9	 doi: 101016/jvetpar201003033 Epub 2010 Apr 1	Toxoplasma gondii isolates have been classified into 3 genetic types. Little is known about genotypes of T. gondii isolates in wild animals in Europe. In this report, genotypes of T. gondii isolates from wildlife in France are described. Sera from wildlife were tested for antibodies to T. gondii with the modified agglutination test, and the hearts from animals with titers superior or equal to 1:6 were bioassayed individually in mice. T.gondii was isolated from 9 of 14 seropositive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 12 of 33 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 1 of 4 deer (Cervus elaphus), 1 of 7 mouflons (Ovis gmelini musimon) and 1 of 2 common mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). No isolate was obtained by bioassay in mice of 1 fallow deer (Dama dama) and of 3 European brown hares (Lepus europaeus). Genotyping of the 24 isolates using PCR-RFLP and microsatellite markers indicated that all were type II and none of these Toxoplasma isolates was virulent for mice.
633	20409452	Evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency of wild bird surveillance for avian influenza.	Knight-Jones TJ, Hauser R, Matthes D, Stark KD	Vet Res	 2010 Jul-Aug;41(4):50	 doi: 101051/vetres/2010023 Epub 2010 Apr 23	This study aimed to assess which method of wild waterbird surveillance had the greatest probability of detecting highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 during a period of surveillance activity, the cost of each method was also considered. Lake Constance is a major wintering centre for migratory waterbirds and in 2006 it was the site of an HPAI H5N1 epidemic in wild birds. Avian influenza surveillance was conducted using harmonised approaches in the three countries around the lake, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, from 2006-2009. The surveillance consisted of testing birds sampled by the following methods: live birds caught in traps, birds killed by hunters, birds caught in fishing nets, dead birds found by the public and catching live Mute Swans (Cygnus olor); sentinel flocks of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were also used. Scenario tree analysis was performed including sensitivity analysis, followed by assessment of cost-effectiveness. Results indicated that if HPAI H5N1 was present at 1% prevalence and assuming HPAI resulted in bird mortality, sampling dead birds found by the public and sentinel surveillance were the most sensitive approaches despite residual uncertainty over some parameters. The uncertainty over the mortality of infected birds was an influential factor. Sampling birds found dead was most cost-effective, but strongly dependent on mortality and awareness of the public. Trapping live birds was least cost-effective. Based on our results, we recommend that future HPAI H5N1 surveillance around Lake Constance should prioritise sentinel surveillance and, if high mortality is expected, the testing of birds found dead.
634	20397088	Concentration of lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic in leg skeletal muscles of three species of wild birds.	Gasparik J, Vladarova D, Capcarova M, Smehyl P, Slamecka J, Garaj P, Stawarz R, Massanyi P	J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng	 2010;45(7):818-23	 doi: 101080/10934521003708992	The aim of this study was to monitor accumulation of lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic in leg skeletal muscle of some wild birds from selected areas of Slovakia and the correlations among the heavy metals. A total of 160 wild birds representing 3 species-Eurasian coot (Fulica atra) (n = 24), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) (n = 68) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) (n = 68) were involved for analyses. Concentrations of heavy metals from samples were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Metal concentrations are expressed as mg/kg wet weight. The order of lead and arsenic concentrations in muscles of wild birds were as follows: mallard > pheasant > Eurasian coot; in the case of arsenic the differences were significant (P < 0.05). Muscle of Eurasian coot accumulated the highest concentration of cadmium and mercury followed by pheasant and the lowest in mallard, but differences were not significant (P > 0.05). Moderately negative correlations were noted in pheasant between cadmium and mercury (r = -0.39), and between mercury and arsenic (r = -0.45). Moderately negative correlation between cadmium and arsenic (r = -0.31) was found for Eurasian coot.
635	20386716	Spatial and temporal association of outbreaks of H5N1 influenza virus infection in wild birds with the 0 degrees C isotherm.	Reperant LA, Fuckar NS, Osterhaus AD, Dobson AP, Kuiken T	PLoS Pathog	 2010 Apr 8;6(4):e1000854	 doi: 101371/journalppat1000854	Wild bird movements and aggregations following spells of cold weather may have resulted in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 in Europe during the winter of 2005-2006. Waterbirds are constrained in winter to areas where bodies of water remain unfrozen in order to feed. On the one hand, waterbirds may choose to winter as close as possible to their breeding grounds in order to conserve energy for subsequent reproduction, and may be displaced by cold fronts. On the other hand, waterbirds may choose to winter in regions where adverse weather conditions are rare, and may be slowed by cold fronts upon their journey back to the breeding grounds, which typically starts before the end of winter. Waterbirds will thus tend to aggregate along cold fronts close to the 0 degrees C isotherm during winter, creating conditions that favour HPAIV H5N1 transmission and spread. We determined that the occurrence of outbreaks of HPAIV H5N1 infection in waterbirds in Europe during the winter of 2005-2006 was associated with temperatures close to 0 degrees C. The analysis suggests a significant spatial and temporal association of outbreaks caused by HPAIV H5N1 in wild birds with maximum surface air temperatures of 0 degrees C-2 degrees C on the day of the outbreaks and the two preceding days. At locations where waterbird census data have been collected since 1990, maximum mallard counts occurred when average and maximum surface air temperatures were 0 degrees C and 3 degrees C, respectively. Overall, the abundance of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and common pochards (Aythya ferina) was highest when surface air temperatures were lower than the mean temperatures of the region investigated. The analysis implies that waterbird movements associated with cold weather, and congregation of waterbirds along the 0 degrees C isotherm likely contributed to the spread and geographical distribution of outbreaks of HPAIV H5N1 infection in wild birds in Europe during the winter of 2005-2006.
636	20382820	Variability in pathobiology of South Korean H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus infection for 5 species of migratory waterfowl.	Kwon YK, Thomas C, Swayne DE	Vet Pathol	 2010 May;47(3):495-506	 doi: 101177/0300985809359602 Epub 2010 Apr 9	The pathobiology of H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus infection in wild waterfowl is poorly understood. This study examined the pathobiology of A/chicken/Korea/IS/06 (H5N1) HPAI in 5 migratory waterfowl species--mute swans (Cygnus olor), greylag geese (Anser anser), ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea), mandarin ducks (Aix galericulata), and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos)--following intranasal inoculation or contact exposure, from which all birds became infected. In mute swans, this virus had strong vascular endothelial cell tropism, producing acute severe disease and 100% mortality; the virus was detected in various parenchymal cells; and necrotic and inflammatory changes were noted in a range of organs, including pancreas, brain, spleen, heart, oral cavity, adrenal gland, lung, and liver. The ruddy shelducks had 100% mortality, but time to death was delayed, and the lesions were primarily restricted to the brain, heart, pancreas, and spleen. The mandarin ducks had only a single mortality, with lesions similar to those in ruddy shelducks. The greylag geese became infected, developed neurological signs, and had residual meningoencephalitis when examined at termination but lacked mortality. The mallards had asymptomatic infection. These results indicate variation in the pathobiology of H5N1 virus infections in different species of wild waterfowl, ranging from severe, acute systemic disease with 100% mortality to asymptomatic infection of respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.
637	20232247	Reproduction in mallards exposed to dietary concentrations of methylmercury.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR	Ecotoxicology	 2010 Jun;19(5):977-82	 doi: 101007/s10646-010-0479-y Epub 2010 Mar 16	The purpose of this experiment was to use mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) tested under controlled conditions to determine how much harm to reproduction resulted from various concentrations of mercury in eggs. Breeding pairs of mallards were fed a control diet or diets containing 1, 2, 4, or 8 microg/g mercury, as methylmercury chloride. Mean concentrations of mercury in eggs laid by parents fed 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 microg/g mercury were 0.0, 1.6, 3.7, 5.9, and 14 microg/g mercury on a wet-weight basis. There were no signs of mercury poisoning in the adults, and fertility and hatching success of eggs were not affected by mercury. Survival of ducklings and the number of ducklings produced per female were reduced by the 4 and 8-microg/g dietary mercury treatments (that resulted in 5.9 and 14 microg/g mercury in their eggs, respectively). Ducklings from parents fed the various mercury diets were just as heavy as controls at hatching, but by 6 days of age ducklings whose parents had been fed 4 or 8 microg/g mercury weighed less than controls. Because we do not know if absorption of mercury from our diets would be the same as absorption from natural foods, the mercury concentrations we report in eggs may be more useful in extrapolating to possible harmful effects in nature than are the dietary levels we fed. We conclude that mallard reproduction does not appear to be particularly sensitive to methylmercury.
638	20187818	Feasibility of transesophageal echocardiography in birds without cardiac disease.	Beaufrere H, Pariaut R, Nevarez JG, Tully TN	J Am Vet Med Assoc	 2010 Mar 1;236(5):540-7	 doi: 102460/javma2365540	OBJECTIVE: To establish a technique of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in birds without cardiac disease and describe the imaging planes obtained. DESIGN: Validation study. ANIMALS: 18 birds including 3 pigeons (Columbia livia), 3 barred owls (Strix varia), 2 red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), 1 goose (Anser anser), 1 mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), 1 Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), 2 brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), 2 Hispaniolan Amazon parrots (Amazona ventralis), 2 red-fronted macaws (Ara rubrogenys), and 1 military macaw (Ara militaris). PROCEDURES: For each bird, anesthesia was induced and maintained by use of isoflurane. A pediatric, multiplane transesophageal ultrasound probe was passed into the esophagus and adjusted to the level of the heart for echocardiography. Probe positions were recorded via fluoroscopy, and associated imaging planes were described. RESULTS: TEE was performed successfully in all birds except the pelicans, 1 Hispaniolan Amazon parrot, and the red-fronted macaws. Five imaging planes of the heart were consistently viewed from 3 positions of the probe (identified as caudal, middle, and cranial positions relative to the cardiac silhouette). M-mode echocardiography of the left ventricle and the aortic root was performed. Color flow and spectral Doppler ultrasonographic images of in- and outflow regions were obtained. One Hispaniolan Amazon parrot died as a result of esophageal perforation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: TEE examination of birds was feasible and provided a larger number of imaging planes with better resolution and details than those typically achieved via a transcoelomic approach. However, TEE should be performed with caution in psittacines.
639	20148704	Contribution of Chinese Pekin duck complement component C3d-P29 repeats to enhancement of Th2-biased immune responses against NDV F gene induced by DNA immunization.	Liu D, Wang J, Niu ZX	Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol	 2010 Jun;32(2):297-306	 doi: 103109/08923970903311802	BACKGROUND AND AIM: C3d, a split product of C3, interacts with its receptor (CR2 or CD21) on B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and is crucial for induction and maintenance of a normal humoral immune response. This fragment of complement protein C3 (C3d) has also been shown to enhance B cell responses when complexed with antigen and C3d fusion increased Th2-biased immune response by inducing IL-4 production. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gene fragment coding for Chinese Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) C3d gene (duC3d) was cloned and expressed as a component of fusion proteins destined for use in in vitro experiments. Two, four and six copies of CR2-binding domain duC3d-P29 were fused, respectively, to truncated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) F gene encoding soluble glycoprotein F in pcDNA3.1.All recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot. BALB/c mice were, respectively, immunized with recombinant plasmids, blank vector, and inactivated vaccine. RESULTS: The result of immunogenicity detections of The IL-4 level for F-C3d-P29.6 DNA immunization approached that for the inactivated vaccine. Compared to C3d-P29.6, C3d-P29.4 enhanced F DNA immunogenicity to a lesser extent. Furthermore, C3d-P29.n fusion increased Th2-biased immune response by inducing IL-4 production. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that C3d-P29 could enhance immunogenicity by directing Th1-biased to a balanced and more effective Th1/Th2 response. The expression of the duck C3d fusion proteins in this study which was the first reported, and the detections of the cytokine level for F-C3d-P29.n in DNA immunization using the BALB/c mice as the model animal, will provide the basis for immunization trials in chicken or other poultry, studies of receptor binding and cell activation of animal lymphocytes, and investigations of new types of vaccine, including genetic recombinant and DNA vaccines for the future against relevant pathogens.
640	20126617	Influenza virus in a natural host, the mallard: experimental infection data.	Jourdain E, Gunnarsson G, Wahlgren J, Latorre-Margalef N, Brojer C, Sahlin S, Svensson L, Waldenstrom J, Lundkvist A, Olsen B	PLoS One	 2010 Jan 28;5(1):e8935	 doi: 101371/journalpone0008935	Wild waterfowl, particularly dabbling ducks such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), are considered the main reservoir of low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs). They carry viruses that may evolve and become highly pathogenic for poultry or zoonotic. Understanding the ecology of LPAIVs in these natural hosts is therefore essential. We assessed the clinical response, viral shedding and antibody production of juvenile mallards after intra-esophageal inoculation of two LPAIV subtypes previously isolated from wild congeners. Six ducks, equipped with data loggers that continually monitored body temperature, heart rate and activity, were successively inoculated with an H7N7 LPAI isolate (day 0), the same H7N7 isolate again (day 21) and an H5N2 LPAI isolate (day 35). After the first H7N7 inoculation, the ducks remained alert with no modification of heart rate or activity. However, body temperature transiently increased in four individuals, suggesting that LPAIV strains may have minor clinical effects on their natural hosts. The excretion patterns observed after both re-inoculations differed strongly from those observed after the primary H7N7 inoculation, suggesting that not only homosubtypic but also heterosubtypic immunity exist. Our study suggests that LPAI infection has minor clinically measurable effects on mallards and that mallard ducks are able to mount immunological responses protective against heterologous infections. Because the transmission dynamics of LPAIVs in wild populations is greatly influenced by individual susceptibility and herd immunity, these findings are of high importance. Our study also shows the relevance of using telemetry to monitor disease in animals.
641	20117191	Condition dependence of iridescent wing flash-marks in two species of dabbling ducks.	Legagneux P, Thery M, Guillemain M, Gomez D, Bretagnolle V	Behav Processes	 2010 Mar;83(3):324-30	 doi: 101016/jbeproc201001017 Epub 2010 Feb 1	Growing empirical evidence supports the hypothesis of male mate choice for female ornaments which are thought to reflect individual quality and future breeding ability. While structural colors are clearly used in mate choice and pairing, the condition dependence of such traits is less obvious, particularly in females. We present spectral measurements of wing flash-marks in two species of dabbling ducks during the pairing period and evaluate color and brightness contrasts as seen through the mallard's (Anas platyrhynchos) visual system. We tested for possible relationships between body size (and condition) and feather measurements both on captive and wild individuals. By analyzing reflectance spectra of semi-captive mallards soon after the molting period, we found that brightness was condition related. Color contrast was positively related to body size, but only in females. In wild ducks, color contrast was positively related to body size in the common teal A. crecca only for females. These results suggest that female color traits are likely to be used by males for mate choice, and support the hypothesis that the structural color is condition-dependent. Finally, brightness contrast decreased over time in both duck species. Natural abrasion or the effect of keratinolytic bacteria could explain such pattern.
642	20093702	Intracellular yeasts in endothelial cells of a great blue heron (Ardea herodias).	Millins C, Hill JE, Wobeser G	J Vet Diagn Invest	 2010 Jan;22(1):131-4	 doi: 101177/104063871002200128	Intracellular organisms in the endothelial cells of several organs of an adult great blue heron (Ardea herodias) were identified as a yeast in the family Saccharomycetales based on ultrastructural morphology and sequence data from the ribosomal RNA operon. Morphologically similar organisms of unknown identity have been described previously in Muscovy (Cairina moschata) and domestic (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) ducks.
643	20093677	Development and application of an indirect immunoperoxidase assay for the detection of Duck swollen head hemorrhagic disease virus antigen in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Li C, Shen C, Cheng A, Wang M, Zhang N, Zhou Y, Zhu D, Jia R, Luo Q, Chen X	J Vet Diagn Invest	 2010 Jan;22(1):10-9	 doi: 101177/104063871002200103	An improved indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) was developed to detect antigens of Duck swollen head hemorrhagic disease virus (DSHDV) in paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). This technique used an indirect streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase labeling system with polyclonal antiserum developed against purified DSHDV antigens. Specimens from the experimentally inoculated Pekin ducks with DSHDV and archived paraffin-embedded tissues from natural cases of Duck viral swollen head hemorrhagic disease (DVSHD) were examined by clinical and histological criteria. Positive staining was most widely observed in the cytoplasm of the following organs: immune, digestive, and urinary organs, heart, lung, and trachea, which corresponded to the intracellular distribution of reovirus. The DSHDV antigens were first detected at 4 hr postinoculation in the bursa of Fabricius of infected ducks. Therefore, this method was suitable for the early diagnosis of DVSHD. Immunoperoxidase staining was not present in tissues and organs of sham-inoculated ducks (negative control). The IPA developed in the current study is a convenient, sensitive, and specific means of detecting DSHDV and is applicable to routine diagnosis, retrospective studies, and prospective studies of DSHDV infection in ducks.
644	20079516	Absorption and biotransformation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers DE-71 and DE-79 in chicken (Gallus gallus), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), American kestrel (Falco sparverius) and black-crowned night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) eggs.	McKernan MA, Rattner BA, Hatfield JS, Hale RC, Ann Ottinger M	Chemosphere	 2010 Mar;79(1):100-9	 doi: 101016/jchemosphere200912023 Epub 2010 Jan 15	We recently reported that air cell administration of penta-brominated diphenyl ether (penta-BDE; DE-71) evokes biochemical and immunologic effects in chicken (Gallus gallus) embryos at very low doses, and impairs pipping (i.e., stage immediately prior to hatching) and hatching success at 1.8mugg(-1) egg (actual dose absorbed) in American kestrels (Falco sparverius). In the present study, absorption of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners was measured following air cell administration of a penta-BDE mixture (11.1mug DE-71g(-1) egg) or an octa-brominated diphenyl ether mixture (octa-BDE; DE-79; 15.4mug DE-79g(-1) egg). Uptake of PBDE congeners was measured at 24h post-injection, midway through incubation, and at pipping in chicken, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and American kestrel egg contents, and at the end of incubation in black-crowned night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) egg contents. Absorption of penta-BDE and octa-BDE from the air cell into egg contents occurred throughout incubation; at pipping, up to 29.6% of penta-BDE was absorbed, but only 1.40-6.48% of octa-BDE was absorbed. Higher brominated congeners appeared to be absorbed more slowly than lower brominated congeners, and uptake rate was inversely proportional to the log K(ow) of predominant BDE congeners. Six congeners or co-eluting pairs of congeners were detected in penta-BDE-treated eggs that were not found in the dosing solution suggesting debromination in the developing embryo, extraembryonic membranes, and possibly even in the air cell membrane. This study demonstrates the importance of determining the fraction of xenobiotic absorbed into the egg following air cell administration for estimation of the lowest-observed-effect level.
645	20064520	Neurons that co-localize aromatase- and kisspeptin-like immunoreactivity may regulate the HPG axis of the Mallard drake (Anas platyrhynchos).	Saldanha CJ, Walters BJ, Fraley GS	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2010 May 1;166(3):606-13	 doi: 101016/jygcen201001007 Epub 2010 Jan 11	Kisspeptin is a potent regulator of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. The activation of several vernal and pubertal behaviors involves the action of locally synthesized estradiol by hypothalamic aromatase-expressing neurons. Little is known about kisspeptin in non-mammalian systems, and its interaction with aromatase remains unexamined. The Mallard drake is a seasonal breeder and an excellent model for studying the neural mechanisms that regulate the HPG. The goals of these studies were to determine (a) if and how kisspeptin regulates the drake HPG, (b) if kisspeptin and aromatase are expressed in the Mallard brain, and (c) if kisspeptin is co-localized or in apposition with, aromatase- and gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone (GnRH) positive neurons. Central kisspeptin administration increased plasma luteinizing hormone, an effect blocked by pretreatment with the GnRH antagonist, acyline, suggesting a conservation of kisspeptin function and mechanism of action in birds and mammals. The distribution of kisspeptin in the mallard brain was examined with immunocytochemistry (ICC). Neurons that express kisspeptin-like immunoreactive (ir) protein were observed in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) and in ir fibers throughout the drake brain. Virtually all POM kisspeptin-ir soma also expressed aromatase-ir, suggesting that autocrine mechanisms may predominate in the interaction between steroid provision and kisspeptin expression. No co-localization was observed between KP-ir and GnRH-ir, although both were easily detected in close-proximity in the tuberoinfundibular area. Taken together, these data suggest that in the drake, estradiol synthesized by aromatase and kisspeptin co-expressing POM neurons may regulate the HPG via an effect on GnRH secretion.
646	20063797	Hemagglutination inhibition test for retrospective diagnosis of avian influenza in mammals	Kurskaia OG, Durymanov AG, Sharshov KA, Zaikovskaia AV, Shestopalov AM, Il'icheva TN	Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol	 2009 Sep-Oct;(5):75-9		AIM: To compare usage of native and formalinized erythrocytes from different animal species in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for detection of level of specific antibodies to H5N1 influenza virus in sera of mammals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Level of anti-H5 antibodies to influenza H5 control antigen and to influenza viruses A/Common gull/Chany/2006 (H5N1), A/duck/Tuva/01/06 (H5N1), A/Anas platyrhynchos/Chany Lake/9/03 (H5N3) was determined by hemagglutination inhibition test in two influenza A (H5) reference antisera as well as in ferret antisera to native strains of avian influenza virus. Equine, rhesus macaque, sheep, guinea pig, goose, and chicken erythrocytes were used. RESULTS: Using reference antisera, H5 hemagglutinin was detected in all tested antigens with all used erythrocytes. While testing ferret antisera in HI test with reference antigen, anti-H5 antibodies were not detected or detected in extremely low titre (1/80) and only with equine erythrocytes. In most cases, titers of anti-H5 antibodies in HI test with formalinized erythrocytes were higher than with native ones. CONCLUSION: During monitoring for antibodies to H5N1 avian influenza virus in human population it is necessary to use native strains of A/H5N1 along with reference antigen. It is possible to use formalinized equine, rhesus macaque, goose, and chicken erythrocytes.
647	20044017	Relationships between circulating leucocytes and Leucocytozoon simondi in mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, ducklings.	Shutler D, Lowe AG, Robinson SR	Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol	 2010 May;156(1):46-9	 doi: 101016/jcbpa200912015 Epub 2009 Dec 31	Leucocytozoon simondi is an apicomplexan blood parasite of waterfowl that frequently causes significant mortality, and thus is expected to provoke a significant immune response in hosts. Using blood smears collected in consecutive weeks from 30 wild-stock mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, ducklings, we tested with repeated measures analyses for associations between leucocyte profiles and L. simondi infection intensities. With each of the five weeks of leucocyte profiles as response variables, we found evidence of fewer circulating heterophils and more circulating lymphocytes in the third week of infection associated with more intense L. simondi infections from the second week, but no significant relationships between leucocytes and the other four weeks of L. simondi infection. With each of the five weeks of L. simondi infection intensities as response variables, we found no associations with leucocyte profiles. Collectively, our results did not reveal tight links between leucocyte profiles and parasitism by L. simondi. Our data suggest that L. simondi was relatively benign to our wild ducks.
648	20021503	The effect of age on the pathogenesis of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected experimentally.	Londt BZ, Nunez A, Banks J, Alexander DJ, Russell C, Richard-Londt AC, Brown IH	Influenza Other Respir Viruses	 2010 Jan;4(1):17-25	 doi: 101111/j1750-2659200900116x	BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have recently displayed increased virulence for wild waterfowl. OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of host age on the shedding and tissue dissemination of a HPAI H5N1 virus in infected Pekin ducks. METHODS: Pekin ducks in two age-matched groups (n = 18), 8 and 12 weeks old (wo) were each infected with 10(6) EID(50)/0.1 ml of HPAI A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1, clade 2.2). Each day for 5 days, birds were monitored clinically, and cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs collected, before three birds from each group were selected randomly for post-mortem examination. Tissue samples were collected for examination by real-time RT-PCR, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: Severe clinical signs, including incoordination and torticollis were observed in the 8 wo group resulting in 100% mortality by 4 dpi. Mild clinical signs were observed in the 12 wo group with no mortality. Real-time RT-PCR and IHC results demonstrated the systemic spread of H5N1 virus in birds of both age groups. Higher levels of virus shedding were detected in oropharyngeal swabs than in cloacal swabs, with similar levels of shedding detected in both age groups. Variations in level and temporal dissemination of virus within tissues of older ducks, and the presence of the virus in brain and heart were observed, which coincided with the appearance of clinical signs preceding death in younger birds. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with reports of natural infections of wild waterfowl and poultry possibly indicating an age-related association with dissemination and clinical outcome in ducks following infection with H5N1 HPAI virus.
649	19999766	Two cases of neoplasia of basal cell origin affecting the axillary region in anseriform species.	Bradford C, Wack A, Trembley S, Southard T, Bronson E	J Avian Med Surg	 2009 Sep;23(3):214-21	 doi: 101647/2008-0151	Neoplasms of the skin are occasionally seen in domestic birds but are uncommon in nondomestic birds. An 8-year-old male hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) was presented with bilateral axillary ulcerative lesions that improved but did not resolve with empiric antibiotic and antifungal therapy. Skin biopsies were taken, and bilateral feather folliculomas were diagnosed on histopathologic examination. The duck was euthanatized because of the poor prognosis. A 9-year-old Indian runner duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was presented with an ulcerative lesion, with pseudomembrane and serocellular crust affecting the axillary region. This mass was diagnosed as a basosquamous carcinoma. The mass was surgically excised, and no recurrence was observed. Feather folliculomas are usually considered benign neoplasms in domestic birds and may be primarily ulcerative, exudative, bilateral, and symmetric in location. Basosquamous carcinoma may have a similar gross appearance. It is unknown if the axillary region may be an area with increased incidence of neoplasia in birds. This appears to be the first report of feather folliculoma and basosquamous carcinoma in Anseriforme species. Feather folliculomas and other neoplasms, such as basosquamous carcinoma, should be considered as a differential diagnosis in ulcerative or proliferative skin lesions in birds.
650	19999383	Surveillance of wild birds for avian influenza A virus (AIV) in Bavaria in the years 2007 and 2008	Rabl S, Rinder M, Neubauer-Juric A, Bogner KH, Korbel R, Buttner M	Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr	 2009 Nov-Dec;122(11-12):486-93		A monitoring programme has been initiated in Bavaria to continuously control wild birds for the presence of avian Influenza A virus (AIV) and to monitor the possible occurrence and accumulation of notifiable AIV subtypes as an early-warning system. In addition information about the regional, seasonal and species-specific distribution of AIV could be obtained. Between July 2007 and December 2008 samples from 5864 wild birds of twelve different zoological orders had been collected (cloacal- and tracheal swab samples, droppings, and organs) and analysed. AIV genomes were detected in 3.7% of the 5864 wild birds by RT real time PCR. The subtype component H5 was identified in 52 samples (0.9%) and the N1 subtype component in 13 samples (0.2%), but never in combination with each other. The hemagglutinine subtype component H7 could not be detected. Most of the positive AIV genome results originated from samples in the district Swabia, which is situated in the central area of the south-west bird migration route across southern Germany and harbours favourable resting areas for migrating birds. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were the most frequently sampled bird species and had the highest AIV infection rate of 6.4%, followed by Tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula) (AIV prevalence of 5.4%), Mute Swans (Cygnus olor) (1.6%), Coots (Fulica atra) (0.3%) and Greylag Goose (Anser anser) (0.1%). The detection rate of AIV in Bavarian wild birds showed a seasonal peak in autumn/winter. Ten virus isolates could be obtained after sample inoculation in embryonated hen's eggs.
651	19965911	Evidence for adaptive evolution of olfactory receptor genes in 9 bird species.	Steiger SS, Fidler AE, Mueller JC, Kempenaers B	J Hered	 2010 May-Jun;101(3):325-33	 doi: 101093/jhered/esp105 Epub 2009 Dec 4	It has been suggested that positive selection, in particular selection favoring a change in the protein sequence, plays a role in the evolution of olfactory receptor (OR) gene repertoires in fish and mammals. ORs are 7-transmembrane domain (TM) proteins, members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily in vertebrate genomes, and responsible for odorant binding and discrimination. OR gene repertoires in birds are surprisingly large and diverse, suggesting that birds have a keen olfactory sense. The aim of this study is to investigate signatures of positive selection in an expanded OR clade (group-gamma-c) that seems to be a characteristic of avian genomes. Using maximum-likelihood methods that estimate the d(N)/d(S) ratios and account for the effects of recombination, we show here that there is evidence for positive selection in group-gamma-c partial OR coding sequences of 9 bird species that are likely to have different olfactory abilities: the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), the black coucal (Centropus grillii), the brown kiwi (Apteryx australis), the canary (Serinus canaria), the galah (Eolophus roseicapillus), the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), and the snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea). Positively selected codons were predominantly located in TMs, which in other vertebrates are involved in odorant binding. Our data suggest that 1) at least some avian OR genes have been subjected to adaptive evolution, 2) the extent of such adaptive evolution differs between bird species, and 3) positive selective pressures may have been stronger on the group-gamma-c OR genes of species that have well-developed olfactory abilities.
652	19937535	Characterization of duck H5N1 influenza viruses with differing pathogenicity in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducks.	Tang Y, Wu P, Peng D, Wang X, Wan H, Zhang P, Long J, Zhang W, Li Y, Wang W, Zhang X, Liu X	Avian Pathol	 2009 Dec;38(6):457-67	 doi: 101080/03079450903349147	A number of H5N1 influenza outbreaks have occurred in aquatic birds in Asia. As aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses and do not usually show clinical disease upon infection, the repeated H5N1 outbreaks have highlighted the importance of continuous surveillance on H5N1 viruses in aquatic birds. In the present study we characterized the biological properties of four H5N1 avian influenza viruses, which had been isolated from ducks, in different animal models. In specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, all four isolates were highly pathogenic. In SPF mice, the S and Y isolates were moderately pathogenic. However, in mallard ducks, two isolates had low pathogenicity, while the other two were highly pathogenic and caused lethal infection. A representative isolate with high pathogenicity in ducks caused systemic infection and replicated effectively in all 10 organs tested in challenged ducks, whereas a representative isolate with low pathogenicity in ducks was only detected in some organs in a few challenged ducks. Comparison of complete genomic sequences from the four isolates showed that the same amino acid residues that have been reported to be associated with virulence and host adaption/restriction of influenza viruses were present in the PB2, HA, NA, M and NS genes, while the amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site were diverse. From these results it appeared that the virulence of H5N1 avian influenza viruses was increased for ducks and that amino acid substitutions at the HA cleavage site might have contributed to the differing pathogenicity of these isolates in mallards. A procedure for the intravenous pathogenicity index test in a mallard model for assessing the virulence of H5/H7 subtype avian influenza viruses in waterfowl is described.
653	19937525	Surveillance for avirulent Newcastle disease viruses in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos and Cairina moschata) at live bird markets in Eastern China and characterization of the viruses isolated.	Liu X, Wang X, Wu S, Hu S, Peng Y, Xue F, Liu X	Avian Pathol	 2009 Oct;38(5):377-91	 doi: 101080/03079450903183637	We isolated and identified 201 Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) from domestic ducks in a 5-year surveillance study at live bird markets in Eastern China. Seventy-three of these isolates were characterized biologically and genetically. Fusion protein (F) genes of these isolates were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Intracerebral pathogenicity index tests in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens and the mean death time of embryonated fowl eggs in addition to the cleavage site analysis of the F-protein precursor for these viruses showed that they were all avirulent NDVs. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of the F gene showed that 30 isolates clustered into the class I clade and the other 43 isolates clustered into genotype I of class II, but diverged from the vaccine virus Queensland V4, which is extensively used in China. Most class I viruses (18/30) formed a separate branch closest to the Hong Kong live bird market strains that have been recently designated as genotype 3, while the rest (12/30) were closely related to some European viruses within genotype 2. All of the 43 class II genotype I viruses diverged from viruses originally assigned to genotype Ia and formed a separate sublineage designated as Ib with water bird isolates from the Far East, suggesting the possible transmission between the wild and domestic waterfowl. The results in the present study clearly showed that the domestic duck population carries avirulent NDVs with genetic divergence regularly and may act as one of the important reservoirs.
654	19937511	Infection studies with two highly pathogenic avian influenza strains (Vietnamese and Indonesian) in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), with particular reference to clinical disease, tissue tropism and viral shedding.	Bingham J, Green DJ, Lowther S, Klippel J, Burggraaf S, Anderson DE, Wibawa H, Hoa DM, Long NT, Vu PP, Middleton DJ, Daniels PW	Avian Pathol	 2009 Aug;38(4):267-78	 doi: 101080/03079450903055371	Pekin ducks were infected by the mucosal route (oral, nasal, ocular) with one of two strains of Eurasian lineage H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus: A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/453/2004 and A/duck/Indramayu/BBVW/109/2006 (from Indonesia). Ducks were killed humanely on days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 after challenge, or whenever morbidity was severe enough to justify euthanasia. Morbidity was recorded by observation of clinical signs and cloacal temperatures; the disease was characterized by histopathology; tissue tropism was studied by immunohistochemistry and virus titration on tissue samples; and viral shedding patterns were determined by virus isolation and titration of oral and cloacal swabs. The Vietnamese strain caused severe morbidity with fever and depression; the Indonesian strain caused only transient fever. Both viruses had a predilection for a similar range of tissue types, but the quantity of tissue antigen and tissue virus titres were considerably higher with the Vietnamese strain. The Vietnamese strain caused severe myocarditis and skeletal myositis; both strains caused non-suppurative encephalitis and a range of other inflammatory reactions of varying severity. The principal epithelial tissue infected was that of the air sacs, but antigen was not abundant. Epithelium of the turbinates, trachea and bronchi had only rare infection with virus. Virus was shed from both the oral and cloacal routes; it was first detected 24 h after challenge and persisted until day 5 after challenge. The higher prevalence of virus from swabs from ducks infected with the Vietnamese strain indicates that this strain may be more adapted to ducks than the Indonesia strain.
655	19914253	Ontogeny of ghrelin mRNA expression and identification of ghrelin-immunopositive cells in the gastrointestinal tract of the Peking duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Shao Y, Liu S, Tang X, Gao J, Wu G, Li Z	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2010 Mar 1;166(1):12-8	 doi: 101016/jygcen200911002 Epub 2009 Nov 13	Ghrelin is an acylated peptide and an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), and stimulates growth hormone release and food intake in mammals. Peking duck is a very fast growing species of poultry. Although the sequence and structure of ghrelin have recently been determined, the expression of ghrelin in Peking duck has not been studied. Here, we investigated the tissue expression and distribution of ghrelin by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, in Peking duck at different stages of development. Ghrelin mRNA expression was mainly detected in the proventriculus and proventriculus-gizzard junction. It was first expressed, but weakly, on embryonic day 14 (E14); the expression increased by embryonic day 21 (E21), and was maintained at high levels between post-hatching-day 1 (P1) and post-hatching-day 60 (P60). Weak expression of ghrelin mRNA was also found in the gizzard and duodenum. In the gastrointestinal tract of growing Peking duck in P60, the largest number of ghrelin-ip cells was detected in the epithelium of the compound tubular glands in the proventriculus and the next largest number was in the proventriculus-gizzard junction. Very few ghrelin-ip cells were located in the epithelium of the simple tubular glands adjacent to the gizzard. No ghrelin-ip cells were observed elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Ghrelin-ip cells were found in embryos as early as day E21; at the same time, the compound tubular glands in the proventriculus had formed. The numbers of ghrelin-ip cells on P1 were similar to those of E21 embryos. However, on P60, high numbers of strongly stained ghrelin-ip cells were found to be scattered in the epithelium of the compound tubular glands in the proventriculus. The density of ghrelin-ip cells (cells/mm(2)) in the proventriculus on P60 was significantly greater than those of P1 and E21 embryos. These results demonstrate that ghrelin is expressed in the Peking duck gastrointestinal tract, especially in the proventriculus, from mid-late-stage embryos to growing period and suggested an involvement of ghrelin in the development and biology of the gastrointestinal tract of the Peking duck.
656	19864211	Urocortin-like immunoreactivity in the primary lymphoid organs of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	De Luca A, Squillacioti C, Pero ME, Paino S, Langella E, Mirabella N	Eur J Histochem	 2009 Sep 23;53(3):167-76	 doi: 104081/ejh2009167	Urocortin (UCN) is a 40 aminoacid peptide which belongs to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family. This family of peptides stimulates the secretion of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) in the pituitary gland. In the present study, using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, the distribution of UCN in the primary lymphoid organs of the duck was investigated at different ages. In the cloacal burse and thymus, Western blot demonstrated the presence of a peptide having a molecular weight compatible with that of the mammalian UCN. In the cloacal burse, immunoreactivity was located in the medullary epithelial cells and in the follicular associated and cortico-medullary epithelium. In the thymus, immunoreactivity was located in single epithelial cells. Double labelling immunofluorescence studies showed that UCN immunoreactivity completely colocalised with cytokeratin immunoreactivity in both the thymus and cloacal burse. Statistically significant differences in the percentage of UCN immunoreactivity were observed between different age periods in the cloacal burse. The results suggest that, in birds, urocortin has an important role in regulating the function of the immune system.
657	19835919	Adaptation and transmission of a duck-origin avian influenza virus in poultry species.	Li J, zu Dohna H, Anchell NL, Adams SC, Dao NT, Xing Z, Cardona CJ	Virus Res	 2010 Jan;147(1):40-6	 doi: 101016/jvirusres200910002 Epub 2009 Oct 14	A duck-origin avian influenza virus (AIV) was used to study viral adaptation and transmission patterns in chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus). Inoculated birds were housed with naive birds of the same species and all birds were monitored for infection. The inoculating duck virus was transmitted effectively by contact in both species. Viruses recovered from infected birds showed mutations as early as 1 or 3 days after inoculation in chickens and ducks, respectively. Amino acid substitutions in hemagglutinin (HA) or deletions in neuraminidase (NA) stalk regions were identified in chicken isolates, but only substitutions in HA were identified in duck isolates. HA substitution-containing viruses replicated more efficiently than those with NA stalk deletions. NA deletion mutants were not recovered from contact chickens, suggesting inefficient transmission. Amino acid substitutions in HA proteins appeared in pairs in chickens, but were independent in ducks, indicating adaptation in chickens. In addition, our findings showed that a duck-origin virus can rapidly adapt to chickens, suggesting that the emergence of new epidemic AIV can be rapid.
658	19821888	Comparison of fluid types for resuscitation after acute blood loss in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lichtenberger M, Orcutt C, Cray C, Thamm DH, DeBehnke D, Page C, Mull L, Kirby R	J Vet Emerg Crit Care (San Antonio)	 2009 Oct;19(5):467-72	 doi: 101111/j1476-4431200900465x	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the LD(50) for acute blood loss in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), compare the mortality rate among 3 fluid resuscitation groups, and determine the time required for a regenerative RBC response. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Medical College of Wisconsin Research facility. ANIMALS: Eighteen mallard ducks were included for the LD(50) study and 28 for the fluid resuscitation study. INTERVENTIONS: Phlebotomy was performed during both the LD(50) and fluid resuscitation studies. Ducks in the fluid resuscitation study received a 5 mL/kg intravenous bolus of crystalloids, hetastarch (HES), or a hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying solution (HBOCS). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The LD(50) for acute blood loss was 60% of total blood volume. This blood volume was removed in the fluid resuscitation study to create a model of acute blood loss. Following fluid administration, 6 birds in the crystalloid group (66%), 4 birds in the HES group (40%), and 2 birds in the HBOCS group (20%) died. No statistical difference in mortality rate was seen among the 3 fluid resuscitation groups. Relative polychromasia evaluated post-phlebotomy demonstrated regeneration starting at 24 hours and continuing through 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The LD(50) for acute blood loss in mallard ducks was 60% of their total blood volume. Although no statistical difference in mortality rate was appreciated among the 3 fluid resuscitation groups, a trend of decreased mortality rate was observed in the HBOCS group. An early regenerative response was apparent following acute blood loss.
659	30256876	Urocortin-like immunoreactivity in the primary lymphoid organs of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	De Luca A, Squillacioti C, Pero ME, Paino S, Langella E, Mirabella N	Eur J Histochem	 2009 Sep 30;53(3):e20	 doi: 104081/ejh2009e20 eCollection 2009 Sep 30	Urocortin (UCN) is a 40 aminoacid peptide which belongs to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family. This family of peptides stimulates the secretion of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) in the pituitary gland. In the present study, using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, the distribution of UCN in the primary lymphoid organs of the duck was investigated at different ages. In the cloacal burse and thymus, Western blot demonstrated the presence of a peptide having a molecular weight compatible with that of the mammalian UCN. In the cloacal burse, immunoreactivity was located in the medullary epithelial cells and in the follicular associated and corticomedullary epithelium. In the thymus, immunoreactivity was located in single epithelial cells. Double labelling immunofluorescence studies showed that UCN immunoreactivity completely colocalised with cytokeratin immunoreactivity in both the thymus and cloacal burse. Statistically significant differences in the percentage of UCN immunoreactivity were observed between different age periods in the cloacal burse. The results suggest that, in birds, urocortin has an important role in regulating the function of the immune system.
660	19742325	The survey of H5N1 flu virus in wild birds in 14 Provinces of China from 2004 to 2007.	Kou Z, Li Y, Yin Z, Guo S, Wang M, Gao X, Li P, Tang L, Jiang P, Luo Z, Xin Z, Ding C, He Y, Ren Z, Cui P, Zhao H, Zhang Z, Tang S, Yan B, Lei F, Li T	PLoS One	 2009 Sep 9;4(9):e6926	 doi: 101371/journalpone0006926	BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza emerged in the year 1996 in Asia, and has spread to Europe and Africa recently. At present, effective monitoring and data analysis of H5N1 are not sufficient in Chinese mainland. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the period from April of 2004 to August of 2007, we collected 14,472 wild bird samples covering 56 species of 10 orders in 14 provinces of China and monitored the prevalence of flu virus based on RT-PCR specific for H5N1 subtype. The 149 positive samples involved six orders. Anseriformes had the highest prevalence while Passeriformes had the lowest prevalence (2.70% versus 0.36%). Among the 24 positive species, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) had the highest prevalence (4.37%). A difference of prevalence was found among 14 provinces. Qinghai had a higher prevalence than the other 13 provinces combined (3.88% versus 0.43%). The prevalence in three species in Qinghai province (Pintail (Anas acuta), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula)) were obviously higher than those in other 13 provinces. The results of sequence analysis indicated that the 17 strains isolated from wild birds were distributed in five clades (2.3.1, 2.2, 2.5, 6, and 7), which suggested that genetic diversity existed among H5N1 viruses isolated from wild birds. The five isolates from Qinghai came from one clade (2.2) and had a short evolutionary distance with the isolates obtained from Qinghai in the year 2005. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have measured the prevalence of H5N1 virus in 56 species of wild birds in 14 provinces of China. Continuous monitoring in the field should be carried out to know whether H5N1 virus can be maintained by wild birds.
661	19733637	Looking like mother makes mallard ducklings dominant over their siblings.	Poisbleau M, Guillemain M, Pinaud D, Demongin L, Carslake D, David J	Behav Processes	 2010 Jan;83(1):127-9	 doi: 101016/jbeproc200908010 Epub 2009 Sep 4	Colour variation in time and space among animals may affect social relationships such as pairing and dominance interactions. For instance, some birds are naturally sensitive to leg colour, with some colours being more visible or attractive than others. The colour of the leg-rings used to mark birds may thus be related to behavioural and reproductive variables. Most studies have investigated this effect for adults during reproduction, but leg-ring colour may also affect the behaviour of young birds. We tested the potential effect of leg-ring colours on the within-brood dominance hierarchy of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings while each brood formed a stable and exclusive family unit with its mother. Ducklings did not acquire a within-brood dominance rank according to the colour of their own ring. This result suggests that mallards may not have a sensory bias for a given colouration. However, ducklings wearing a ring of the same colour as one of the two rings of their mother were dominant over their siblings. We discuss the potential behavioural and methodological implications of this result.
662	19656363	Comparative genomics in chicken and Pekin duck using FISH mapping and microarray analysis.	Skinner BM, Robertson LB, Tempest HG, Langley EJ, Ioannou D, Fowler KE, Crooijmans RP, Hall AD, Griffin DK, Volker M	BMC Genomics	 2009 Aug 5;10:357	 doi: 101186/1471-2164-10-357	BACKGROUND: The availability of the complete chicken (Gallus gallus) genome sequence as well as a large number of chicken probes for fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and microarray resources facilitate comparative genomic studies between chicken and other bird species. In a previous study, we provided a comprehensive cytogenetic map for the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and the first analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in birds. Here, we extend this approach to the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos), an obvious target for comparative genomic studies due to its agricultural importance and resistance to avian flu. RESULTS: We provide a detailed molecular cytogenetic map of the duck genome through FISH assignment of 155 chicken clones. We identified one inter- and six intrachromosomal rearrangements between chicken and duck macrochromosomes and demonstrated conserved synteny among all microchromosomes analysed. Array comparative genomic hybridisation revealed 32 CNVs, of which 5 overlap previously designated "hotspot" regions between chicken and turkey. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest extensive conservation of avian genomes across 90 million years of evolution in both macro- and microchromosomes. The data on CNVs between chicken and duck extends previous analyses in chicken and turkey and supports the hypotheses that avian genomes contain fewer CNVs than mammalian genomes and that genomes of evolutionarily distant species share regions of copy number variation ("CNV hotspots"). Our results will expedite duck genomics, assist marker development and highlight areas of interest for future evolutionary and functional studies.
663	19640549	Experimental challenge of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and "Brachyspira suanatina" isolated from pigs and mallards.	Jansson DS, Rasback T, Fellstrom C, Feinstein R	J Comp Pathol	 2009 Nov;141(4):211-22	 doi: 101016/jjcpa200903007 Epub 2009 Jul 28	Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and a recently proposed and closely related enteropathogenic spirochaete "Brachyspira suanatina", originally isolated from pigs or mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), were used to inoculate week-old mallard ducklings orally or cloacally. The colonization rate, clinical outcome, faecal dry matter content, blood leucocyte counts and gross, microscopical and electron microscopical features 14-16 days post-inoculation were investigated at necropsy examination. Strains of "B. suanatina" of pig and mallard origin and B. hyodysenteriae of mallard origin colonized the ducklings by oral inoculation, and colonization was also established by cloacal inoculation with a "B. suanatina" strain of mallard origin. The porcine reference strain of B. hyodysenteriae (B204) failed to colonize the birds. Unchallenged contact birds in one of the challenge groups were readily colonized by a strain of "B. suanatina" of mallard origin. The proportion of colonized birds differed significantly between the challenge groups (P < 0.0001). For each challenge group, the inoculum and a randomly selected subset of recovered isolates had an identical biochemical profile and banding pattern by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. None of the birds developed clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease during the trial. The faecal dry weight contents, body weights and total leucocyte and heterophil counts did not differ between the various groups of birds. At the microscopical and electron microscopical levels, the caecal mucosa in some of the Brachyspira culture-positive birds had sharply demarcated epithelial cell changes and there were features of irreversible cell damage in crypt necks coinciding with spirochaetal infiltration of the mucosa. The crypts in Brachyspira culture-positive birds were deeper than in culture-negative birds (median: 237 microm and 218 microm, respectively, P = 0.019). This challenge model was well suited for use in mallards and consistent with previous findings that strongly haemolytic Brachyspira spp. may cross the species barrier between pigs and birds.
664	19630230	Experimental West Nile virus infection in aigamo ducks, a cross between wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domesticus).	Shirafuji H, Kanehira K, Kubo M, Shibahara T, Kamio T	Avian Dis	 2009 Jun;53(2):239-44	 doi: 101637/8504-102708-Reg1	Four 2-wk-old and four 4-wk-old aigamo ducks, a cross between wild and domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos and Anas platyrhynchos var. domesticus, respectively), were infected with the NY99 strain of West Nile virus (WNV) to investigate WNV's pathogenicity in aigamo ducks and the possibility that they could transmit WNV. In the group of infected 2-wk-old aigamo ducks (2w-infection group), all of the ducks ate and drank less and showed decreased activity, some showed ataxia, and one died. Meanwhile, the group of infected 4 wk olds (4w-infection group) showed no clinical signs during the experimental period. Viremia was observed in all of the ducks in both age groups. Peak viral titers in the three surviving members of the 2w-infection group were 10(3.7)-10(5.3) plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml serum; the peak was 10(7.1) PFU/ml serum in the 2w duck that died from the infection. Peak viral titers in the 4w-infection group were 10(4.1)-10(4.9) PFU/ml serum. Viral shedding in the oral and/or cloacal cavity was observed in all four members of the 2w-infection group and in three of the four members of the 4w-infection group. These results suggest that WNV-infected aigamo ducks can transmit WNV. Although aigamo ducks are reared in East Asia, where WNV is an exotic pathogen, the virus could be introduced and spread there in the future; thus it is important to take precautions against an introduction, and measures to prevent infection to aigamo duck operations should be prepared.
665	19581004	Production of house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) IgA specific anti-sera and its application in immunohistochemistry and in ELISA for detection of Mycoplasma gallisepticum-specific IgA.	Grodio JL, Buckles EL, Schat KA	Vet Immunol Immunopathol	 2009 Dec 15;132(2-4):288-94	 doi: 101016/jvetimm200906006 Epub 2009 Jun 17	The IgA antibody response plays a vital role in mucosal immunity because it functions to neutralize pathogens at the mucosal surface and thus impedes attachment to underlying tissues. Although the importance of IgA in the mucosal immunity of galliform birds has been established, studies examining IgA-based immunity in passerine birds are lacking, perhaps due in part to the absence of reagents that can detect passerine IgA. A 469 base pair region of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) IgA heavy chain was PCR-amplified from spleen cDNA and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence was found to share 55% and 46% identity with the IgA heavy chain of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and chicken (Gallus gallus), respectively. The heavy chain fragment was produced using a bacterial expression system and purified. Rabbit anti-sera were generated against the recombinant protein. The anti-sera reacted with a single house finch serum protein ( approximately 50-55kDa) in Western blot. The anti-sera were used to identify plasma cells in the Harderian gland and conjunctiva of house finches with conjunctivitis associated with Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection. The anti-sera were also utilized in an ELISA to detect M. gallisepticum-specific IgA antibodies in lachrymal samples of infected finches.
666	19579789	Animal reservoirs of human virulent microsporidian species	Slodkowicz-Kowalska A	Wiad Parazytol	 2009;55(1):63-5		The main objective of the present study was to determined the occurrence of Encephalitozoon intestinalis, E. hellem, E. cuniculi, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi in Poland in animal faecal using the FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization) and multiplex FISH techniques. Additional objectives included: (1) identification of animal hosts of microsporidia that are infectious to humans amongst free-ranging, captive, livestock and domestic animals; (2) a molecular analysis of randomly selected parasite isolates and determination of their zoonotic potential; (3) evaluation of the role of animals in the dissemination of microsporidia spores in the environment, and an estimation of the potential risk of infection for other animals and humans. A total of 1340 faecal samples collected from 178 species of animals were examined using conventional staining (chromotrope-2R and calcofluor white M2R staining) and molecular techniques (FISH and multiplex FISH techniques). Microsporidian spores were detected in 33 faecal samples (2.5%) obtained from 17 animal species. Microsporidia were demonstrated more often in birds (6.1%) than in mammals (0.7%); the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.00001). In addition, the prevalence of microsporidian infections in waterfowl was significantly higher than the prevalence of microsporidian infections in other animals (p < 0.03). Animal reservoirs of human infectious microsporidia were disclosed in six of 38 sites where faecal samples were taken from animals. Three species of human virulent microsporidia were identified in animals. Spores of E. hellem were found in 25 faecal samples (1.9%) taken from 12 bird species (6 zoo bird species, 4 free-ranging bird species, 2 livestock bird species). Spores of E. intestinalis were identified in five faecal samples (0.4%) taken from two livestock bird species and two zoo mammal species. In turn, E. bieneusi spores were detected only in three faecal samples (0.2%) taken from three zoo mammal species. It was demonstrated that the new hosts of E. hellem are the following bird species: mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), greyleg goose (Anser anser), mute swan (Cygnus olor), black-necked swan (Cygnus melancoryphus), black swan (Cygnus atratus), coscoroba swan (Coscoroba coscoroba), black-crowned crane (Balearica pavonina), nicobar pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) and carrion crow (Corvus cornix). In addition, E. hellem was found for the first time in birds from the Anseriformes and Gruiformes orders. Whereas E. intestinalis was disclosed for the first time in the domestic goose (Anser anser f. domestica), red ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata rubra) and the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), while the black lemur (Eulemur macaco flavifrons), mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz) and the Visayan warty pig (Sus cebifrons negrinus) were first found to carry E. bieneusi. The mammal species that were found to carry E. bieneusi and E. intestinalis are included in The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The results of the present study are significant from an epidemiological point of view. The wild, livestock and zoo animals that were found to carry microsporidia live in different conditions, and thus their role as animal reservoirs for these dangerous pathogens varies. Waterfowl birds may be the main source of contamination of surface waters with E. hellem spores and the protection of surface waters is virtually impossible. Moreover, isolates of E. hellem from mute swans have SSU rRNA sequences identical to E. hellem genotype reported 10 years ago in HIV-positive patient in USA (GenBank Accession no. L19070). This result indicate that E. hellem from mute swans can be a potential source of infection for humans. The contamination of the human environment with microsporidian spores infectious to humans is also facilitated by farm and synanthropic birds, because E. hellem and E. intestinalis were found in farms pigeons, domestic goose and the carrion crow. These birds can also be the source of infectious for breeders and ornithologists. The occurrence of microsporidiosis in animals kept in zoological gardens may constitute a deadly hazard not only for the animals themselves, but also for zoo personnel and visitors. The identification of animal reservoirs of E. hellem, E. intestinalis and E. bieneusi in Poland points to the possibility of infection of humans. The results of the present study have shown that the FISH technique, although time-consuming, is very sensitive, not overly costly and--what is of prime importance--it enables identification of microsporidian species, and therefore should be used for diagnosing microsporidiosis in humans and animals.
667	19523985	Evaluation of an epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus in domestic and wild avian and mammalian species.	Sullivan HJ, Blitvich BJ, VanDalen K, Bentler KT, Franklin AB, Root JJ	J Virol Methods	 2009 Oct;161(1):141-6	 doi: 101016/jjviromet200906001 Epub 2009 Jun 11	An epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus in taxonomically diverse domestic and wild vertebrate species. In contrast to the bELISAs published previously that require reagent production, manipulation by the end-user, or have not been evaluated for use with both mammalian and avian species, this assay is performed using commercially available recombinant nucleoprotein antigen and corresponding nucleoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody and has been shown to work with multiple avian and mammalian species. The efficacy of the bELISA as a serum screening assay was compared to the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay using 251 serum samples obtained from experimentally infected mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). The concordance between the AGID assay and bELISA was 94.1% (95% CI=89.9, 98.3) for raccoons, and 71.2% (95% CI=63.5, 78.9) for mallards and 82.8% (95% CI=78.2, 87.3) overall. The bELISA was more sensitive than the AGID assay as demonstrated by the detection of antibodies to influenza A virus at earlier time points in experimental infection studies and at higher serial dilutions. The efficacy of the bELISA to monitor natural influenza A virus exposure was also compared to the AGID assay using an additional 745 serum samples from six avian species and six mammalian species. This bELISA provides a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive technique for large-scale surveillance of influenza A virus exposure in taxonomically diverse vertebrate species.
668	19514809	Antibodies to flaviviruses in wild ducks captured in Hokkaido, Japan: risk assessment of invasive flaviviruses.	Saito M, Osa Y, Asakawa M	Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis	 2009 Jun;9(3):253-8	 doi: 101089/vbz20080111	Recently, the distribution of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) has expanded into new territories. The invasion of WNV into Japan is of great concern. The migration of birds is suggested to be involved in the expanded distribution of these flaviviruses. In this study, 92 wild ducks--20 Anas poecilorhyncha (migratory breeders), 50 Anas platyrhynchos (undetermined), 16 Anas acuta (winter visitors), and 6 Anas penelope (winter visitors)--were captured in autumn of 2005 and 2006, in the central part of Hokkaido, a low JEV activity area. A seroepidemiologic analysis of flavivirus infections was conducted with 90% and 50% focus reduction neutralization tests (FRNT(90) and FRNT(50)). Of the 92 serum samples, 1 (1.1%) and 5 (5.4%) tested positive for WNV-specific and JEV-specific antibodies, respectively, in the FRNT(90), and 61 (66.3%) and 79 (85.9%) tested positive for WNV and JEV, respectively, in the FRNT(50). These results indicate that wild ducks in this study had been exposed to flaviviruses. The results together with the recognized distribution of flaviviruses and migratory routes of individual duck species strongly suggested that the birds captured in this study had been exposed to flaviviruses, including WNV, on the flyway, not in Hokkaido.
669	19463029	Development of Eustrongylides ignotus (Nematoda: Dioctophmida) in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica (L.)).	Xiong F, Wang GT, Wu SG, Nie P	J Parasitol	 2009 Oct;95(5):1035-9	 doi: 101645/GE-20571 Epub 2009 May 22	Investigating the development of Eustrongylides ignotus in its definitive host would enable us to trace the complete life cycle of this nematode. Fourth-stage larvae isolated from naturally infected swamp eels (Monopterus albus) were used to infect domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica [L.]). We observed that male and female worms exhibited different developmental patterns in host ducks. In males, the fourth molt occurred at day 1-2 post-infection (PI), after which they attained maturity on day 4 PI and died between day 7 and 9 PI. However, females underwent the fourth molt at day 2-4 PI, produced eggs from day 9 to 17 PI, and then degenerated and died. When compared to fourth-stage female larvae, adult females demonstrated a considerable increase in total body size with a 151% increase in average body width and a 17% increase in average body length. However, the increase in size of the male larvae was not as significant as that in females. The average body width in adult males exhibited only a 45% increase over that in the larval stage.
670	19453436	Avian influenza surveillance in wild birds in the European Union in 2006.	Hesterberg U, Harris K, Stroud D, Guberti V, Busani L, Pittman M, Piazza V, Cook A, Brown I	Influenza Other Respir Viruses	 2009 Jan;3(1):1-14	 doi: 101111/j1750-2659200800058x	BACKGROUND: Infections of wild birds with highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) subtype H5N1 virus were reported for the first time in the European Union in 2006. OBJECTIVES: To capture epidemiological information on H5N1 HPAI in wild bird populations through large-scale surveillance and extensive data collection. METHODS: Records were analysed at bird level to explore the epidemiology of AI with regard to species of wild birds involved, timing and location of infections as well as the applicability of different surveillance types for the detection of infections. RESULTS: In total, 120,706 records of birds were sent to the Community Reference Laboratory for analysis. Incidents of H5N1 HPAI in wild birds were detected in 14 EU Member States during 2006. All of these incidents occurred between February and May, with the exception of two single cases during the summer months in Germany and Spain. CONCLUSIONS: For the detection of H5N1 HPAI virus, passive surveillance of dead or diseased birds appeared the most effective approach, whilst active surveillance offered better detection of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. No carrier species for H5N1 HPAI virus could be identified and almost all birds infected with H5N1 HPAI virus were either dead or showed clinical signs. A very large number of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were tested in 2006 and while a high proportion of LPAI infections were found in this species, H5N1 HPAI virus was rarely identified in these birds. Orders of species that appeared to be very clinically susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus were swans, diving ducks, mergansers and grebes, supporting experimental evidence. Surveillance results indicate that H5N1 HPAI virus did not establish itself successfully in the EU wild bird population in 2006.
671	19406168	Broadly targeted multiprobe QPCR for detection of coronaviruses: Coronavirus is common among mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Muradrasoli S, Mohamed N, Hornyak A, Fohlman J, Olsen B, Belak S, Blomberg J	J Virol Methods	 2009 Aug;159(2):277-87	 doi: 101016/jjviromet200904022 Epub 2009 May 3	Coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause trivial or fatal disease in humans and in animals. Detection methods for a wide range of CoVs are needed, to understand viral evolution, host range, transmission and maintenance in reservoirs. A new concept, "Multiprobe QPCR", which uses a balanced mixture of competing discrete non- or moderately degenerated nuclease degradable (TaqMan) probes was employed. It provides a broadly targeted and rational single tube real-time reverse transcription PCR ("NQPCR") for the generic detection and discovery of CoV. Degenerate primers, previously published, and the new probes, were from a conserved stretch of open reading frame 1b, encoding the replicase. This multiprobe design reduced the degree of probe degeneration, which otherwise decreases the sensitivity, and allowed a preliminary classification of the amplified sequence directly from the QPCR trace. The split probe strategy allowed detection of down to 10 viral nucleic acid equivalents of CoV from all known CoV groups. Evaluation was with reference CoV strains, synthetic targets, human respiratory samples and avian fecal samples. Infectious-Bronchitis-Virus (IBV)-related variants were found in 7 of 35 sample pools, from 100 wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Ducks may spread and harbour CoVs. NQPCR can detect a wide range of CoVs, as illustrated for humans and ducks.
672	19374476	Rapid increases in mercury concentrations in the eggs of mallards fed methylmercury.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2009 Sep;28(9):1979-81	 doi: 101897/09-0601	To determine how quickly breeding birds would have to feed in a mercury-contaminated area before harmful concentrations of mercury, as methylmercury, built up in their eggs, we fed female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) a control diet or diets containing 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 8 microg/g mercury (on what was close to a dry weight basis) as methylmercury chloride for 23 d. After 18 d on their respective mercury diets, the eggs of mallards fed 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 8 microg/g mercury contained 97.8, 86.0, 89.9, 88.9, and 85.9%, respectively, of the peak concentrations reached after 23 d. Depending on the dietary concentration of mercury, no more than approximately a week may be required for harmful concentrations (0.5-0.8 microg/g, wet weight) to be excreted into eggs.

Skirnisson K, Aldhoun JA, Kolarova L	J Helminthol	 2009 Jun;83(2):165-71	 doi: 101017/S0022149X09336408 Epub 2009 Apr 16	In the past decade, swimmer's itch (SI) has repeatedly occurred in people who have been wading or bathing in ponds or lakes in Iceland where water birds and snails are abundant. Some of the affected sites were warmed by geothermal activity, and others were not. A search for the causative agent of SI, ocellate furcocercariae that have been found in Iceland only in Radix peregra snails, revealed an average infection prevalence of 1.4% (n = 12,432). Locally, infection rates commonly exceeded 6%, the highest value observed being 24.5%. A search for adult schistosomes in visceral organs and the nasal cavities of 110 water birds belonging to the orders Gaviiformes, Podicipediformes and Anseriformes revealed eggs, miracidia or adult stages of at least seven previously identifiable schistosome species in four anseriform bird species. A previously unknown species of schistosome, Allobilharzia visceralis, was detected in whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus), and classified in a new genus. In mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) a nasal Trichobilharzia sp. and the visceral schistosome T. franki were identified. In red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), distinct egg types belonging to two species of the genus Trichobilharzia have been found. In grey-lag goose (Anser anser) two different egg types were also found - a large Trichobilharzia sp. and small eggs of a Dendritobilharzia sp. Additionally, unidentified cercariae, probably belonging to a previously undescribed genus were detected in R. peregra in Oslandsstjorn. Taken together, the data obtained by morphological examination of eggs and recent DNA sequencing results, indicate that at least eight species of bird schistosomes occur in Iceland.
674	19362739	Discovery of Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 2 (Apl_AvBD2) with antibacterial and chemotactic functions.	Soman SS, Arathy DS, Sreekumar E	Mol Immunol	 2009 Jun;46(10):2029-38	 doi: 101016/jmolimm200903003 Epub 2009 Apr 11	The cationic, cysteine-rich peptides called beta-defensins play a major role in the innate immune response. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of the duck beta-defensin-2 homologue, Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 2 (Apl_AvBD2). The 195 base pair open reading frame (ORF) of Apl_AvBD2 has 83% identity with Gga_AvBD2 (chicken) and 85% identity with Mga_AvBD2 (turkey) at nucleotide level. The gene corresponding to the coding region is comprised of three exons and two introns in both Apl_AvBD2 and Gga_AvBD2. The predicted secondary structure of Apl_AvBD2 has the classical "beta-defensin core motif" formed by the beta-sheet rich structure. Apart from mild expression in tissues like kidney, lung, brain, bursa of Fabricious and ovary, Apl_AvBD2 mRNA show a very high level constitutive expression in bone marrow and spleen, indicating that it is a myeloid defensin. Purified recombinant Apl_AvBD2 demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 3.7 microM against Micrococcus luteus NCIM 2871 and Escherichia coli NCIM 2685, and of 2.2 microM against Reimerella anatipestifer. The immunomodulatory potential of Apl_AvBD2 was shown by chemotaxis of DT-40 chicken B-lymphocytes. The widespread tissue distribution and the potent bactericidal and chemotactic activity make Apl_AvBD2 an important molecule in the innate immune response in ducks. It may play a vital role in the immune response of these birds against bacterial and viral pathogens.

Jouet D, Ferte H, Hologne C, Kaltenbach ML, Depaquit J	J Helminthol	 2009 Jun;83(2):181-9	 doi: 101017/S0022149X09311712 Epub 2009 Apr 9	The prevalence of human cercarial dermatitis (HCD) caused by bird schistosomes appears to be increasing in France, in light of the impact of tourism combined with high densities of wild aquatic hosts in freshwater areas. The present work expands our knowledge of schistosome systematics by including samples of bird schistosomes collected from their natural hosts in France. Heads (318) and viscera (81) of aquatic birds belonging to 16 species from five orders, collecting during the hunting seasons or found dead, were autopsied for nasal and visceral schistosomes. Eggs and/or adults were analysed by molecular methods using the D2 domain and the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) region of rDNA to determine species. Even if nasal eggs were polymorphic according to the host, all haplotypes were similar to that of Trichobilharzia regenti. Marked diversity of visceral species was observed. Final hosts under natural conditions were reported. For the first time, Trichobilharzia franki is reported in its natural bird hosts, Anas platyrhynchos, Anas crecca, Aythya fuligula and Cygnus olor. We also identified T. szidati in A. crecca and Anas clypeata. Bilharziella polonica was found in six species of aquatic birds, including Grus grus. This finding is the first record of bird schistosomes in this aquatic bird. Three new taxa of visceral schistosomes in Anser anser are strongly suspected according to their haplotypes. Futhermore, a new haplotype of visceral schistosomes isolated in Cygnus olor and similar to Allobilharzia visceralis was identified.
676	19297545	Effects of aerobic and anaerobic metabolic inhibitors on avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors.	Pilarski JQ, Solomon IC, Kilgore DL Jr, Hempleman SC	Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol	 2009 May;296(5):R1576-84	 doi: 101152/ajpregu906082008 Epub 2009 Mar 18	Birds have rapidly responding respiratory chemoreceptors [intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC)] that provide vagal sensory feedback about breathing pattern. IPC are exquisitely sensitive to CO(2) but are unaffected by hypoxia. IPC continue to respond to CO(2) during hypoxic and even anoxic conditions, suggesting that they may generate ATP needed for signal transduction anaerobically. To assess IPC energy metabolism, single-cell action potential discharge and acid-base status were recorded from 26 pentobarbital-anesthetized Anas platyrhynchos before and after intravenous infusion of the glycolytic blocker iodoacetate (10-70 mg/kg), mitochondrial blocker rotenone (2 mg/kg), and/or mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (5-15 mg/kg). After 5 min exposure at the highest dosages, iodoacetate inhibited IPC discharge 65% (15.9 +/- 0.3 s(-1) to 5.5 +/- 0.3 s(-1), P < 0.05), rotenone inhibited discharge 80% (12.9 +/- 0.5 s(-1) to 2.6 +/- 0.6 s(-1), P < 0.05), and 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited discharge 19% (14.0 +/- 0.3 s(-1) to 11.3 +/- 0.3 s(-1), P < 0.05). These results suggest that IPC utilize glucose, require an intact glycolytic pathway, and metabolize the products of glycolysis to CO(2) and H(2)O by mitochondrial respiration. The small but significant effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol suggests that ATP production by glycolysis may be sufficient to meet IPC energy demands if NADH can be oxidized to NAD experimentally by uncoupling mitochondria, or physiologically by transient lactate production. A model for IPC spike frequency adaptation is proposed, whereby the rapid onset of phasic IPC discharge requires ATP from anaerobic glycolysis, using lactate as the electron acceptor, and the roll-off in IPC discharge reflects transient acidosis due to intracellular lactic acid accumulation.
677	19296877	Bird schistosome diversity in Iceland: molecular evidence.	Aldhoun JA, Kolarova L, Horak P, Skirnisson K	J Helminthol	 2009 Jun;83(2):173-80	 doi: 101017/S0022149X09289371 Epub 2009 Mar 19	During the years 2002-2007, Icelandic freshwater snails and birds from different orders were examined for bird schistosomes. Only the snail Radix peregra and anatid birds proved to be infected. In total, 32 samples of bird schistosome cercariae from seven localities and four samples of adults of Anas platyrhynchos and Mergus serrator from two localities were used for sequencing of the internal transcibed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA. Based on the sequence and position in the phylogenetic tree, five species/genotypes of bird schistosomes were identified. Three of them correspond to the sequences in GenBank for Trichobilharzia franki, Trichobilharzia sp. JR-2007 from Anas penelope (isolates Pl7 and Pl10) and schistosomatid sp. JR-2004 from Physa fontinalis. The other two species/genotypes belong to the genus Trichobilharzia, but their further determination was not possible due to lack of data. All of these species/genotypes develop in R. peregra, probably the only suitable intermediate host species in Iceland. As T. franki and schistosomatid sp. JR-2004 were previously reported from other snail species, the findings from Iceland proved that, under some circumstances, bird schistosomes are able to adapt to a different snail species; some of them can even adapt to a snail belonging to a different gastropod family. High diversity of bird schistosomes in Iceland is probably linked with migratory flyways of birds, as several bird species from Iceland overwinter in western Europe as well as in North America.

Huang CW, Cheng YS, Rouvier R, Yang KT, Wu CP, Huang HL, Huang MC	Genet Sel Evol	 2009 Mar 17;41:28	 doi: 101186/1297-9686-41-28	Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) with multicolored fluorescent molecular markers was used to analyze duck (Anas platyrhynchos) genomic DNA and to construct the first AFLP genetic linkage map. These markers were developed and genotyped in 766 F2 individuals from six families from a cross between two different selected duck lines, brown Tsaiya and Pekin. Two hundred and ninety-six polymorphic bands (64% of all bands) were detected using 18 pairs of fluorescent TaqI/EcoRI primer combinations. Each primer set produced a range of 7 to 29 fragments in the reactions, and generated on average 16.4 polymorphic bands. The AFLP linkage map included 260 co-dominant markers distributed in 32 linkage groups. Twenty-one co-dominant markers were not linked with any other marker. Each linkage group contained three to 63 molecular markers and their size ranged between 19.0 cM and 171.9 cM. This AFLP linkage map provides important information for establishing a duck chromosome map, for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL mapping) and for breeding applications.
679	19280366	The differential expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors in various duck tissues.	Wu Y, Liu X, Xiao H, Zhang H	Mol Biol Rep	 2010 Mar;37(3):1235-40	 doi: 101007/s11033-009-9494-6 Epub 2009 Mar 12	Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) plays important role in regulate a variety of target genes which involves in lipid metabolism. In the present study, 1,430 bp of PPARalpha and 1,650 bp of PPARgamma in Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) were cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The cloned sequences of PPARalpha and PPARgamma were highly conserved, although relevant changes with respect to human, mouse, chicken, and goose were identified. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine if the PPARalpha and PPARgamma were expressed in different tissues of male and female Peking ducks. The expression of PPARalpha and PPARgamma were widely distributed in all examined tissues. The expression level of PPARalpha was highest in liver and lowest in kidney in male and female ducks. And it was highest in abdominal fat and lowest in small intestine of PPARgamma in male and female ducks.
680	19267595	Spring migration routes of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) that winter in Japan, determined from satellite telemetry.	Yamaguchi N, Hiraoka E, Fujita M, Hijikata N, Ueta M, Takagi K, Konno S, Okuyama M, Watanabe Y, Osa Y, Morishita E, Tokita K, Umada K, Fujita G, Higuchi H	Zoolog Sci	 2008 Sep;25(9):875-81	 doi: 102108/zsj25875	Wild birds, in particular waterfowl, are common reservoirs of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and infected individuals could spread the viruses during migrations. We used satellite telemetry to track the spring migration of the mallard ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos ) that winter in Japan. We studied their migration routes, distribution of stopover and breeding sites, and timing of migration movements. We tracked 23 mallards from four different wintering sites. Nine of the 23 mallards reached presumable breeding sites, where migration terminated. The migration routes of the birds greatly differed not only among the wintering sites but also within the same wintering site, although the general feature of the routes was shared among birds within the same wintering site. The mallards used several stopover sites, and they typically stayed for a long period (about one to four weeks) at a site between migration intervals of two to three days. Stopover sites were located in northeast Japan, the eastern coastline of South Korea and North Korea, and the interior of Far Eastern Russia. Mallards from three different wintering sites used a stopover area near the middle part of the Ussuri river in Russia. The terminal sites, which were presumably also breeding sites, were distributed widely over northeast Asia and Far Eastern Russia. These results suggest that mallards that winter in Japan originate from breeding areas widely distributed across eastern Asia. Mallards could potentially transmit avian influenza viruses between Japan and a broad region of northeastern Asia.
681	19249079	Simultaneous determination of microcystin contaminations in various vertebrates (fish, turtle, duck and water bird) from a large eutrophic Chinese lake, Lake Taihu, with toxic Microcystis blooms.	Chen J, Zhang D, Xie P, Wang Q, Ma Z	Sci Total Environ	 2009 May 1;407(10):3317-22	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv200902005 Epub 2009 Feb 26	This is the first to conduct simultaneous determination of microcystin (MC) contaminations in multi-groups of vertebrates (fish, turtle, duck and water bird) from Lake Taihu with Microcystis blooms. MCs (-RR, -YR, -LR) in Microcystis scum was 328 microg g(-1) DW. MCs reached 235 microg g(-1) DW in intestinal contents of phytoplanktivorous silver carp, but never exceeded 0.1 microg g(-1) DW in intestinal contents of other animals. The highest MC content in liver of fish was in Carassius auratus (150 ng g(-1) DW), followed by silver carp and Culter ilishaeformis, whereas the lowest was in common carp (3 ng g(-1) DW). In livers of turtle, duck and water bird, MC content ranged from 18 to 30 ng g(-1) DW. High MC level was found in the gonad, egg yolk and egg white of Nycticorax nycticorax and Anas platyrhynchos, suggesting the potential effect of MCs on water bird and duck embryos. High MC contents were identified for the first time in the spleens of N. nycticorax and A. platyrhynchos (6.850 and 9.462 ng g(-1) DW, respectively), indicating a different organotropism of MCs in birds. Lakes with deaths of turtles or water birds in the literatures had a considerably higher MC content in both cyanobacteria and wildlife than Lake Taihu, indicating that toxicity of cyanobacteria may determine accumulation level of MCs and consequently fates of aquatic wildlife.
682	19216259	Bilateral testicular germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor in a pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Leach S, Heatley JJ, Pool RR Jr, Spaulding K	J Avian Med Surg	 2008 Dec;22(4):315-9	 doi: 101647/2007-0171	An intact male white pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) was presented for examination because of respiratory distress and 2- to 3-month history of lameness and lethargy. Results of radiography, ultrasonography, and cytologic examination revealed a large neoplastic mass in the coelom. The duck was euthanatized, and results of necropsy revealed 2 large, lobulated masses in the coelom and a small nodule on the liver. Histopathologic examination of the large masses revealed a collision pattern testicular tumor consisting of Sertoli, seminoma, and interstitial cell components. The hepatic nodule was a metastatic lesion consistent with a Sertoli cell testicular tumor. This is the first reported case of a mixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumor in a duck.
683	19174921	Functional analysis of avian metallothionein isoforms: an ecotoxicological approach for assessing potential tolerability to element exposure.	Nam DH, Kim EY, Iwata H	Environ Sci Technol	 2008 Dec 15;42(24):9391-6	 doi: 101021/es801332p	To assess the inducibility of avian metallothionein (MT) genes and potential tolerability of their protiens to element exposure, we investigated the transcriptional inducibilities of cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) MT genes in CV-1 cells by elements and detoxification potencies of their in vitro synthesized MT proteins. About 1.3 kb of 5'-upstream regions were sequenced for cormorant MT1 and 2 genes, where two metal-responsive elements were identified. Both cormorant MT promoters were dose dependently activated by Cd, Zn, Cu, and CH3Hg, whereas no transactivation was detected by Pb, TI, Ag, inorganic Hg, Cr(VI), Cr(III), As(V), As(III), Ni, Co, Rb, and Bi, suggesting a shared transactivational mechanism of both MTs for specific elements. These findings support our previous results, where Cu and Zn concentrations were shown to be positively correlated with hepatic MT1/2 mRNA levels in wild cormorants. Comparison of EC50 and LOEL (lowest observed effect level) for each element revealed that Cd was the most potent inducer of MT1/2 promoters, followed by CH3Hg, Zn, and Cu. Since LOELs of CH3Hg for both MT promoters were higher than the hepatic levels in wild cormorants, hepatic CH3Hg concentration may not be high enough to induce MT mRNA in the wild population. Although LOELs of Cd were much lower than the hepatic concentrations detected in wild cormorants, no significant correlation was observed between hepatic Cd levels and MT mRNAs. This may be due to the masking effect of multiple elements, probably by Zn and/or Cu that were highly accumulated in wild cormorants. Cotreatment of Cd with Zn supported a possible suppression of Cd-induced MT expression by Zn in wild cormorants. MT1 and 2 proteins of cormorant and mallard endowed Escherichia coli with significantly higher growth rate than control to Cd exposure (500-1000 microM), implying that avian MTs could be involved in the detoxification of intracellular Cd. This study provides the first evidence on the inducibility of avian MT isoforms by specific elements and functional significance of each avian MT isoform in detoxifying intracellular heavy metals. Our in vitro approaches demonstrate their validity in predicting the response of MTs to element exposure in a wild avian population.
684	19129127	Effects of influenza A virus infection on migrating mallard ducks.	Latorre-Margalef N, Gunnarsson G, Munster VJ, Fouchier RA, Osterhaus AD, Elmberg J, Olsen B, Wallensten A, Haemig PD, Fransson T, Brudin L, Waldenstrom J	Proc Biol Sci	 2009 Mar 22;276(1659):1029-36	 doi: 101098/rspb20081501	The natural reservoir of influenza A virus is waterfowl, particularly dabbling ducks (genus Anas). Although it has long been assumed that waterfowl are asymptomatic carriers of the virus, a recent study found that low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) infection in Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) negatively affected stopover time, body mass and feeding behaviour. In the present study, we investigated whether LPAI infection incurred ecological or physiological costs to migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in terms of body mass loss and staging time, and whether such costs could influence the likelihood for long-distance dispersal of the avian influenza virus by individual ducks. During the autumn migrations of 2002-2007, we collected faecal samples (n=10918) and biometric data from mallards captured and banded at Ottenby, a major staging site in a flyway connecting breeding and wintering areas of European waterfowl. Body mass was significantly lower in infected ducks than in uninfected ducks (mean difference almost 20 g over all groups), and the amount of virus shed by infected juveniles was negatively correlated with body mass. There was no general effect of infection on staging time, except for juveniles in September, in which birds that shed fewer viruses stayed shorter than birds that shed more viruses. LPAI infection did not affect speed or distance of subsequent migration. The data from recaptured individuals showed that the maximum duration of infection was on average 8.3 days (s.e. 0.5), with a mean minimum duration of virus shedding of only 3.1 days (s.e. 0.1). Shedding time decreased during the season, suggesting that mallards acquire transient immunity for LPAI infection. In conclusion, deteriorated body mass following infection was detected, but it remains to be seen whether this has more long-term fitness effects. The short virus shedding time suggests that individual mallards are less likely to spread the virus at continental or intercontinental scales.
685	19105044	Paternity assessment: application on estimation of breeding value in body-weight at first egg trait of egg-laying duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Ren J, Lu L, Liu X, Tao Z, Zhang C, Wang D, Shen J, Liu W, Tian Y, Zhu Z	Mol Biol Rep	 2009 Nov;36(8):2175-81	 doi: 101007/s11033-008-9432-z Epub 2008 Dec 23	Paternity index was analyzed using five microsatellite loci among Chinese egg-laying ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Based on the paternity relationship that was identified by paternity index analysis, the estimated breeding value (EBV) was calculated using BLUP (best linear unbiased predictor) method. Body weight at first egg (BWF) is the only considered trait in this study. In total, 12 sires, 31 dams and 77 daughters were involved in the EBV calculation. The results demonstrated that five microsatellite loci's polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.795 in locus AY493338 to 0.957 in locus AY493264 with average 0.899; the parent-offspring relationships were built by these microsatellites' genotype, 12 families of half sibling and 2 families of full sibling were involved, and the relationship error is smaller than 10(-7). The EBV results suggest that the average EBV was significantly higher in females (average EBV is 10.234 and 0.1045 for mother and daughter, respectively) than males (average EBV is just -26.44). The EBV results on BWF were in good agreement with the principle of GH (growth hormone) expression in poultry. These results show that paternity analyses of Chinese egg-laying ducks were basically resolved using the five microsatellite loci selected. The paternity relationships can apply in Chinese egg-laying duck breeding to quicken the improvement of genetic progress.
686	19081011	Dispersal of viable row-crop seeds of commercial agriculture by farmland birds: implication for genetically modified crops.	Cummings JL, Handley LW, Macbryde B, Tupper SK, Werner SJ, Byram ZJ	Environ Biosafety Res	 2008 Oct-Dec;7(4):241-52	 doi: 101051/ebr:2008021 Epub 2008 Dec 16	To address some concerns about the expansion of genetically engineered pharmaceutical and industrial crops to outdoor plantings and potential impacts on the human food supply, we determined whether commercial agriculture seeds of maize or corn Zea mays L., barley Hordeum vulgare L., safflower Carthamus tinctorius L. and rice Oryza sativa L. are digested or pass viably through the digestive tract, or are transported externally, by captive mallard ducks Anas platyrhynchos L., ring-necked pheasants Phasianus colchicus L., red-winged blackbirds Agelaius phoeniceus (L.) and rock pigeons Columba livia Gmelin (with the exception of whole maize seeds which were too large to feed to the blackbirds). These crop seeds, whether free-fed or force-fed, did not pass through the digestive tract of these bird species. The birds nonetheless did retain viable seeds in the esophagus/crop and gizzard for several hours. For example, after foraging for 6 h, mallards had retained an average of 228 +/- 112 barley seeds and pheasants 192 +/- 78 in the esophagus/crop, and their germination rates were 93 and 50%, respectively. Birds externally transported seeds away from the feeding location, but in only four instances were seeds found attached to their muddy feet or legs and in no case to feathers. Risk of such crop seeds germinating, establishing and reproducing off site after transport by a bird (externally or internally) or movement of a carcass by a predator, will depend greatly on the crop and bird species, location, environmental conditions (including soil characteristics), timing, and seed condition.
687	19069785	The first break-through of the genotype 2.3.2 of high-virulence influenza A virus A/HSN1, which is new for Russia, in the Far East	L'vov DK, Zhchelkanov MIu, Vlasov NA, Prilipov AG, Deriabin PG, Fediakina IT, Galkina IV, Zaberezhnyi AD, Liapina OV, Shliapnikova OV, Kireev DE, Fesenko EE, Kalmykov MV, Vitkova ON, Morozova TN, Proshina ES, Grebennikova TV, Akanina DS, Samokhvalov EI, Al'khovskii SV, Volkov VA, Semenov VI, Gaponov VV, Shmakov NI, Kushnir AT, Kazarian AS, Starikov NS, Petrenko MS, Slavskii AA, Litvin KE, Shcherbakova LO, Frolov AV, Manin TB, Umanets OA, Bandeev VV, Khvan AM, Dunaev VG, Cheledina TP, Abgarian SR, Mikhailovich VM, Zasedatelev AS, Liubchenko EN, Fliagin VN, Tikhonova IF, Maslov DV, Anan'ev VIu, Baranov NI, Gorelikov VN, Iakovlev SS, Aliper TI, Nepoklonov EA, Suarez D	Vopr Virusol	 2008 Sep-Oct;53(5):4-8		The epizootic etiologically associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 genotype 2.3.2 that is new for Russia among wild and domestic birds in the south of the Primorye Territory during spring migration in April 2008 has been decoded. About 25% of the wild birds of a water complex, which include European teals (Anas crecca), mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), great-crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus), are involved in viral circulation in the area of the Suifun-Khankai plain. Chicken embryos and the cell lines MDCK, SPEV, BHK-21, SW-13 were used to isolate 3 strains from recently deceased hens (A/chicken/Primorje/1/08, A/chicken/Primorje/11/08, and A/chicken/Primorje/12/08) and one strain from a European teal (A/Anas crecca/Primorje/8/08). The strains were deposited in the State Collection of Viruses of the Russian Federation, D. I. Ivanovsky Research Institute of Virology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The nucleotide sequences of the full-sized genomes of A/chicken/Primorje/1/08 and A/Anas crecca/Primorje/8/08 were sent to the International databank GenBank. The strains from domestic and wild birds were shown to be identical. The isolated strains are most close to the strains Alchicken/Viet Nam/10/05, A/chicken/Guangdong/178/04, and A/duck/Viet Nam/12/05. Molecular genetic analysis has indicated that the strains isolated are susceptible to rimantadine and ozeltamivir and less adapted to mammalian cells (particularly, they contain E627 in RV2, which agrees with the biological properties of these strains in vitro). Penetration of the newly isolated virus into the Far East ecosystem provides in the foreseeable future a way for infecting the birds wintering in America and Australia in the nesting places, with further carriage of viral populations there in the period of autumn migrations.
688	19045936	Toxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (DE-71) in chicken (Gallus gallus), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and American kestrel (Falco sparverius) embryos and hatchlings.	McKernan MA, Rattner BA, Hale RC, Ottinger MA	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2009 May;28(5):1007-17	 doi: 101897/08-3181	Embryonic survival, pipping and hatching success, and sublethal biochemical, endocrine, and histological endpoints were examined in hatchling chickens (Gallus gallus), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and American kestrels (Falco sparverius) following air cell administration of a pentabrominated diphenyl ether (penta-BDE; DE-71) mixture (0.01-20 microg/g egg) or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 126 (3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl; 0.002 microg/g egg). The penta-BDE decreased pipping and hatching success at concentrations of 10 and 20 microg/g egg in kestrels but had no effect on survival endpoints in chickens or mallards. Sublethal effects in hatchling chickens included ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) induction and histological changes in the bursa, but these responses were not observed in other species. Polychlorinated biphenyl congener 126 (positive control) reduced survival endpoints in chicken and kestrel embryos and caused sublethal effects (EROD induction, reduced bursal mass and follicle size) in chickens. Mallards were clearly less sensitive than the other species to administered penta-BDE and PCB 126. In a second experiment, the absorption of penta-BDE (11.1 microg/g egg, air cell administered during early development) into the contents of chicken and kestrel eggs was determined at various intervals (24 h postinjection, midincubation, and pipping). By pipping, 29% of the penta-BDE administered dose was present in the egg contents in chickens, and 18% of the administered dose was present in kestrel egg contents. Based on uptake in kestrels, the lowest-observed-effect level on pipping and hatching success may be as low as 1.8 microg total penta-BDE/g egg, which approaches concentrations detected in eggs of free-ranging birds. Because some penta-BDE congeners are still increasing in the environment, the toxic effects observed in the present study are cause for concern in wildlife.
689	19035321	Role of amino acid residues at positions 322 and 329 of hemagglutinin in virulence of H5N1 avian influenza virus	Tang YH, Wu PP, Sun Q, Peng DX, Zhang WJ, Li YF, Wang WB, Long JX, Zhang PH, Liu XF	Bing Du Xue Bao	 2008 Sep;24(5):340-4		Two H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIV), A/mallard/Huadong/S/2005 (S, IVPI = 2.65, in mallard) and A/mallard/Huadong/Y/2003 (Y, IVPI = 0, in mallard), were capable of distinct in pathogenicity to non-immunized mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). There were two amino acid residues difference in the HA cleavage site between two viruses, 322 (S, Leu; Y, Gln) and 329 (S, deletion; Y, Lys). Based on the variation, a series of recombinant viruses carrying HA gene either from S or Y virus with mutation at 322 and/or 329 were constructed via reverse genetics system to explore the influence of the two amino acid residues on viral pathogenicity in mallards. Recombinant viruses with S virus backbone were completely attenuated in terms of their virulence to ducks when position 322 (L322Q) and/or position 329 (-329K) of HA gene had been mutated. The critical role that L322 and -329 of HA protein from S virus play in the high virulence to ducks were influenced by the entire background of that protein because the recombinant virus with HA gene from Y and other seven genes from S were completely attenuated even if Q322L and K329- mutations of HA gene had been achieved. Recombinant viruses with Y virus backbone significantly increased their virulence to ducks when position 322 (Q322L) and/or position 329 (K329-) of HA gene had been mutated. All recombinant viruses carrying HA gene from Y with Q322L and/or K329-mutations and other seven genes from S were completely attenuated in terms of virulence to ducks whereas all recombinant viruses carrying HA gene from Y with same mutations and other seven genes from Y gained significant virulence. It seems that the compatibility among eight genes might be an important factor for HA to exert its functions. Results indicated that the mutation at amino acid position 322 and deletion at 329 in HA cleavage site significantly influence the pathogenicity of S and Y viruses in mallard, the compatibility among eight genes also contribute to the pathogenicity of both viruses in mallard.
690	19023759	Pathogenesis of highly pathogenic avian influenza A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 H5N1 in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected experimentally.	Londt BZ, Nunez A, Banks J, Nili H, Johnson LK, Alexander DJ	Avian Pathol	 2008 Dec;37(6):619-27	 doi: 101080/03079450802499126	Asian H5N1 (hereafter referred to as panzootic H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus has caused large numbers of deaths in both poultry and wild-bird populations. Recent isolates of this virus have been reported to cause disease and death in commercial ducks, which has not been seen with other HPAI viruses. However, little is known about either the dissemination of this H5N1 within the organs or the cause of death in infected ducks. Nineteen 4-week-old Pekin ducks were infected with 10(6.7) median egg infectious doses of HPAI A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1, clade 2.2) in 0.1ml via the intranasal and intraocular routes. Cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were taken daily before three animals were selected randomly and killed humanely for postmortem examination, when samples of tissues were taken for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry. Clinical signs were first observed 4 days post infection (d.p.i.) and included depression, reluctance to feed, in-coordination and torticollis resulting in the death of all the birds remaining on 5d.p.i. Higher levels of virus shedding were detected from oropharyngeal swabs than from cloacal swabs. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry identified peak levels of virus at 2d.p.i. in several organs. In the spleen, lung, kidney, caecal tonsils, breast muscle and thigh muscle the levels were greatly reduced at 3d.p.i. However, the highest viral loads were detected in the heart and brain from 3d.p.i. and coincided with the appearance of clinical signs and death. Our experimental results demonstrate the systemic spread of this HPAI H5N1 virus in Pekin ducks, and the localization of virus in the brain and heart tissue preceding death.
691	18980430	Somatosensory evoked potentials and sensory nerve conduction velocities in the thoracic limb of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Brenner DJ, Larsen RS, Pascoe PJ, Wack RF, Williams DC, Dickinson PJ	Am J Vet Res	 2008 Nov;69(11):1476-80	 doi: 102460/ajvr69111476	OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinically applicable technique for recording cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) following stimulation of the radial and ulnar nerves and establish reference values for radial and ulnar sensory nerve conduction velocities (SNCVs) in the wings of ducks. ANIMALS: 8 clinically normal adult female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). PROCEDURES: Radial and ulnar compound nerve action potentials (CNAPs) and CDPs were recorded following distal sensory nerve stimulation. The CDPs were recorded from the interarcuate space between the last cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. Surgical dissection and transection of the brachial plexus in 1 anesthetized duck were performed to identify nerve root location and confirm functional loss of nerve conduction assessed by loss of the CDP. RESULTS: Radial and ulnar CNAPs and CDPs were consistently recorded in all birds. Median radial SNCV was 38.3 m/s (range, 36.0 to 49.0 m/s), and ulnar SNCV was 35.3 m/s (range, 28.0 to 40.0 m/s). Surgical transection of the brachial plexus resulted in complete loss of the CDP. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Measurement of radial and ulnar SNCV or CDP is feasible in isoflurane-anesthetized mallard ducks. The CDP accurately reflects sensory nerve conduction through the brachial plexus. Assessment of brachial plexus function in mallard ducks via evaluations of SNCVs and CDPs may have application for diagnosis of traumatic injuries to the brachial plexus, evaluation of neuropathies associated with exposure to toxic chemicals, and assessment of the efficacy of interventions such as brachial plexus nerve blockade.
692	18972701	The bird species of Kumasir lake (Kahramanmaras-Turkey) and a view of environmental ethics on sustainable wetland management.	Inac S, Gorucu O, Pinar AH	J Environ Biol	 2008 May;29(3):411-4		Kumasir lake is located next to towns of Donuklu and Fatih, nine km west of Kahramanmaras city center the region of east Mediterranean, Turkey This lake is of crucial importance from the point of native and immigrant birds. We located 17 birdspecies in this area during our observations carried out in the spring and autumn of 2005-2006. These were Ciconia ciconia L., Anas platyrhynchos L., Accipiter nisus L., Accipiter brevipes L., Fulica atra L., Columba palumbus L., Merops apiaster L., Upupa epops L., Alauda arvensis L., Motacilla flava L., Turdus merula L., Acrocephalus scirpaceus L., Regulus regulus L., Garrulus glandarius L., Corvus corax L., Fringilla coelebs L., Hirundo rustica L.. Among observed 17 species; 6 of them were immigrant and remaining 11 of them were native birds. Kumasir lake is surrounded by wetland of Amik and Gavur lake. Since it was greatly dried, it was transformed to farmland. Consequently the birds lost most of theirnests and settlements. However not taken in the care of environmental ethic values, the wastewaters of the villages drain to lake reservoir; herbicides and insecticides used for agriculture are polluting the water reeds have been burned, the lake's reeds are getting dry by the irrigation for the farmland. So, the wetland ecosystem is being affected negatively by these factors. On the other hand, the birds are exposed to illegal and unlawful hunting. For this reasons, this lake must be taken into a management regime of sustainable wetland (protection profiting balance) and used techniques of participation planning via the process of sustainable natural resources and planning.
693	18959332	Estimating species occurrence, abundance, and detection probability using zero-inflated distributions.	Wenger SJ, Freeman MC	Ecology	 2008 Oct;89(10):2953-9	 doi: 101890/07-11271	Researchers have developed methods to account for imperfect detection of species with either occupancy (presence absence) or count data using replicated sampling. We show how these approaches can be combined to simultaneously estimate occurrence, abundance, and detection probability by specifying a zero-inflated distribution for abundance. This approach may be particularly appropriate when patterns of occurrence and abundance arise from distinct processes operating at differing spatial or temporal scales. We apply the model to two data sets: (1) previously published data for a species of duck, Anas platyrhynchos, and (2) data for a stream fish species, Etheostoma scotti. We show that in these cases, an incomplete-detection zero-inflated modeling approach yields a superior fit to the data than other models. We propose that zero-inflated abundance models accounting for incomplete detection be considered when replicate count data are available.
694	18957137	A homogenous nature of native Chinese duck matrilineal pool.	He DQ, Zhu Q, Chen SY, Wang HY, Liu YP, Yao YG	BMC Evol Biol	 2008 Oct 29;8:298	 doi: 101186/1471-2148-8-298	BACKGROUND: China, with around 30 unique breeds, has a diverse duck genetic pool. Currently, there is no systematic report which investigates the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship, and matrilineal genetic structure of these domestic breeds and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). RESULTS: In this study, we sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region segments in 278 domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) from 19 indigenous breeds/populations and 70 wild mallard samples and analyzed them together with the 101 control region sequences from published sources. Fifty-two samples were then sequenced for a cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene fragment to solidify the pattern emerged from the control region sequences. All domestic duck and wild mallard haplotypes were essentially indistinguishable and were clustered together in the phylogenetic tree. There was no geographic differentiation and breed/population-specific distribution of duck lineages. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that unlike other domesticated farm animals in China such as chicken, cattle, goat, and yak with multiple matrilineal components, the matrilineal pool of Chinese ducks was homogenous.
695	18937540	A nonlethal microsampling technique to monitor the effects of mercury on wild bird eggs.	Stebbins KR, Klimstra JD, Eagles-Smith CA, Ackerman JT, Heinz GH	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2009 Mar;28(3):465-70	 doi: 101897/08-3161 Epub 2008 Oct 20	Methylmercury is the predominant chemical form of mercury reported in the eggs of wild birds, and the embryo is the most sensitive life stage to methylmercury toxicity. Protective guidelines have been based mainly on captive-breeding studies with chickens (Gallus gallus), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) or on field studies where whole eggs were collected and analyzed and the effects of the mercury were measured based on the reproductive success of the remaining eggs. However, both of these methods have limitations. As an alternative, we developed a technique that involves extracting a small sample of albumen from a live egg, sealing the egg, returning the egg to its nest to be naturally incubated by the parents, and then relating the hatching success of this microsampled egg to its mercury concentration. After first developing this technique in the laboratory using chicken and mallard eggs, we selected the laughing gull (Larus atricilla) and black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) as test subjects in the field. We found that 92% of the microsampled laughing gull eggs met our reproductive endpoint of survival to the beginning of hatching compared to 100% for the paired control eggs within the same nests. Microsampled black-necked stilt eggs exhibited 100% hatching success compared to 93% for the paired control eggs. Our results indicate that microsampling is an effective tool for nonlethally sampling mercury concentrations in eggs and, as such, can be used for monitoring sensitive species, as well as for improving studies that examine the effects of mercury on avian reproduction.
696	18825730	An extract of Hydrilla verticillata and associated epiphytes induces avian vacuolar myelinopathy in laboratory mallards.	Wiley FE, Twiner MJ, Leighfield TA, Wilde SB, Van Dolah FM, Fischer JR, Bowerman WW	Environ Toxicol	 2009 Aug;24(4):362-8	 doi: 101002/tox20424	Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) is a neurological disease affecting bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), American coots (Fulica americana), waterfowl, and other birds in the southeastern United States. The cause of the disease is unknown, but is thought to be a naturally produced toxin. AVM is associated with aquatic macrophytes, most frequently hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), and researchers have linked the disease to an epiphytic cyanobacterial species associated with the macrophytes. The goal of this study was to develop an extraction protocol for separating the putative toxin from a hydrilla-cyanobacterial matrix. Hydrilla samples were collected from an AVM-affected reservoir (J. Strom Thurmond Lake, SC) and confirmed to contain the etiologic agent by mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) bioassay. These samples were then extracted using a solvent series of increasing polarity: hexanes, acetone, and methanol. Control hydrilla samples from a reference reservoir with no history of AVM (Lake Marion, SC) were extracted in parallel. Resulting extracts were administered to mallards by oral gavage. Our findings indicate that the methanol extracts of hydrilla collected from the AVM-affected site induced the disease in laboratory mallards. This study provides the first data documenting for an "extractable" AVM-inducing agent.
697	18809869	Absence of donor-derived zona pellucida protein C homolog in the inner perivitelline layer of Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos)-Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) chimeras (Duails).	Sha J, Gao J, Li J, Zhao Q, Tao G, Zhao C, Han H, Mori M, Li Z	Poult Sci	 2008 Oct;87(10):2064-72	 doi: 103382/ps2007-00228	Avian blastodermal cells at stage X are used to produce interspecies chimeras for heterogenous poultry reproduction. However, recipient-derived inner perivitelline layer (IPVL)-enclosed donor-derived ova may affect the efficiency of germline transmission via chimera. Among the proteins in the IPVL, zona pellucida protein C (ZPC) plays an important role in sperm-egg binding and inducing the acrosome reaction. In the present study, Peking duck blastodermal cells at stage X were transferred into subgerminal cavities of Japanese quail embryos at the same stage. Fourteen female duck-quail chimeras (duails) were hatched and raised to sexual maturity. After being screened by PCR, 3 duails were selected for examination of donor-derived ZPC. A total of 152 IPVL protein samples from the individual eggs laid by the 3 duails then underwent a preliminary examination for the presence of donor-derived ZPC by means of SDS-PAGE, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and Western blotting. A novel 35-kDa ZPC, not observed in quail but in duck, was found in the IPVL of the duails. Further analysis of peptide mass fingerprinting of Peking duck ZPC, Japanese quail ZPC, and the 35-kDa duail ZPC by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that the novel ZPC was an isoform of quail ZPC. Moreover, comparison of N-terminal amino acid sequences of these 3 ZPC confirmed that the 35-kDa quail ZPC had more amino acids at the N terminus than did native quail ZPC, and none of the donor-derived ZPC was found in the duails. These findings suggest that it would be difficult to obtain donor-derived offspring by natural mating of interspecies chimeras.
698	18716782	A role for natriuretic peptide in lipopolysaccharide-induced fever in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos): is natriuretic peptide an endogenous antipyretic in birds-	Marais M, Gray DA	J Comp Physiol B	 2009 Feb;179(2):125-32	 doi: 101007/s00360-008-0295-3 Epub 2008 Aug 21	The febrile mechanism in all vertebrates involves endogenous molecules which mediate and attenuate the fever response. This mechanism is considered phylogenetically conserved, and the molecules are thought to be analogous in different species. The above notion is supported by evidence which show avian and mammalian fevers to have similar mediators. There is, however, a paucity of information regarding the modulators of the avian febrile response. Natriuretic peptides were shown to modulate mammalian fevers and, although natriuretic peptides are also present in birds, they have never been investigated in the context of fever. We induced fever in Pekin ducks with lipopolysaccharide and, at the same time, treated the animals with natriuretic peptide antiserum at a dose that effectively inhibited the known renal actions of endogenously secreted natriuretic peptide. We compared fever responses after ducks received either the antiserum or an appropriate control along with the lipopolysaccharide. The antiserum did not attenuate the fever responses of ducks. Our results differ from the results of a study in rats, which demonstrated natriuretic peptides to be potently antipyretic. This molecule seems to be antipyretic in mammals but not in ducks. We suggest a species variation regarding the ability of natriuretic peptides to modulate fever.
699	18689651	Oral toxicity of p-aminopropiophenone to brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), dama wallabies (Macropus eugenii), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Fisher P, O'Connor CE, Morriss G	J Wildl Dis	 2008 Jul;44(3):655-63	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-443655	Development of p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) as a toxicant for pest predator management in New Zealand and Australia prompted investigation of its toxicity to potential nontarget species. Acute oral toxicity of PAPP in brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), dama wallabies (Macropus eugenii), and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) was estimated in pen trials, carried out between February 2000 and September 2001. The susceptibility of possums (LD50>or=500 mg kg(-1)) and wallabies (LD50 89 mg kg(-1)) to PAPP was low in comparison to noncarnivorous placental mammal species, but ducks (LD50 38 mg kg(-1)) were more susceptible than other bird species. These results suggest that the nontarget hazard to possums and wallabies from PAPP bait applied for pest predator control would be low. However, future development of PAPP as a vertebrate pest control agent should include rigorous assessments of the hazard posed by bait formulations to bird species and provision for delivery techniques that could mitigate exposure of nontarget birds.
700	18687407	Is the hepatic metabolism of glucose and linoleic acid influenced by species in overfed ducks-	Saez G, Baeza E, Davail S, Durand D, Bauchart D, Gruffat D	Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol	 2008 Dec;151(4):576-81	 doi: 101016/jcbpa200807015 Epub 2008 Jul 17	There are genetic differences in the hepatic glucose and linoleic acid metabolisms between Muscovy and Pekin ducks ad libitum-fed. To understand the effect of overfeeding on the hepatic metabolisms in these two species of ducks, we compared the different pathways of glucose and linoleic acid reaching the liver of Muscovy (Cairina moschata) (n=6) and Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos) (n=6) ducks overfed for 1 week and sacrificed 2-4 h after their last meal by using the ex vivo method of liver slices incubated for 16 h with [U-(14)C]-glucose, [1-(14)C]-linoleic acid and [(35)S]-methionine added to the survival medium. The glucose was the main precursor of triacylglycerol synthesis in the liver of these two species and its hepatic metabolism was similar between species. The hepatic uptake of linoleic acid was 1.7-fold higher (P=0.020) in the Muscovy duck than in the Pekin duck leading to a 1.9-fold higher (P=0.017) esterification of this fatty acid in the liver of the Muscovy duck than in that of the Pekin duck. Finally, both species after 1 week of overfeeding exhibited the same capacity to secrete VLDL remaining insufficient to avoid hepatic steatosis.
701	18664102	Enteric helminths of the mallard Anas platyrhynchos L., 1758 in the north-western part of Poland	Kavetska KM, Rzad I, Kornyushin VV, Korol EN, Sitko J, Szalanska K	Wiad Parazytol	 2008;54(1):23-9		Although the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, is the most common wild duck in Poland, as well as in the entire Palearctic, it is extremely rarely studied by comprehensive parasitological surveys. The aim of this study was to present a synthesis on the species composition of enteric helminths of the mallard in north-western Poland. The study was carried out in 1999-2006 and involved parasitic worms isolated from the alimentary tracts of 187 mallards (Anseriformes: Anatidae). Following isolation, the parasites were preserved in 70% ethylene and stained (flatworms) or viewed in transient light (nematodes and acanthocephalans). Taxonomic identity of the worms was determined using taxonomic keys and numerous original papers. The studies have revealed that the parasitic community of this host in the north-west part of Poland is relatively complex, composed of 51 species of helminths of four systematic groups: 16 digenean species, 23 tapeworms, 9 nematodes, and 3 acanthocephalans. The material also revealed five new to Polish fauna parasitic species: one trematode (Echinostoma miyagawai) and four tapeworms (Microsomacanthus baeri, M. pachycephala, Monotestilepis tadornae, and Sobolevicanthus aculeostileticus). On the other hand, for another 11 species (Prosthogonimus ovatus, Psilotrema simillimum, Australapatemon minor, Leucochloridiomorpha lutea, Psilostomum brevicolle, Echinocotyle rosseteri, Fimbriarioides sp., Retinometra giranensis, Anisakinae gen. sp., Pseudocapillaria mergi i Polymorphus magnus) the mallard was found to be a new host.
702	18657864	Dendritic cell inhibitory and activating immunoreceptors (DCIR and DCAR) in duck: Genomic organization and expression.	Guo X, Branton WG, Moon DA, Xia J, Macdonald MR, Magor KE	Mol Immunol	 2008 Sep;45(15):3942-6	 doi: 101016/jmolimm200806014 Epub 2008 Jul 26	C-type lectin immunoreceptor genes encoding DC inhibitory and activating receptors (DCIR and DCAR) were identified in a spleen EST library of duck (Anas platyrhynchos). These receptors are of interest for their potential as regulators of antigen presenting cells. A genomic clone was isolated and fully sequenced, containing one DCIR gene and two DCAR genes arranged in tandem order. Duck DCIR encodes an inhibitory receptor that features an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic domain. DCAR1 is a pseudogene. DCAR2 encodes an activating receptor with a positively charged residue in the transmembrane region. Full-length and alternatively spliced forms of both DCIR and DCAR2 are apparent. Duck DCIR and DCAR transcripts are preferentially expressed in immune and mucosal tissues including spleen, bursa of Fabricius, intestine and lung. Targeting these receptors on dendritic cells holds potential for breaking tolerance or for enhancing immune responses, relevant to the duck model for hepatitis B and vaccination against avian influenza.
703	18648047	Comparison of the association of age with the infection of Salmonella and Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium in Pekin ducks and Roman geese.	Yu CY, Chu C, Chou SJ, Chao MR, Yeh CM, Lo DY, Su YC, Horng YM, Weng BC, Tsay JG, Huang KC	Poult Sci	 2008 Aug;87(8):1544-9	 doi: 103382/ps2008-00018	Nontyphoid Salmonella have a broad host range in poultry and mammals, and serovar Typhimurium is a threat to public health. In this study, normal and sick ducks and geese were collected from 12 farms in Taiwan to investigate the age-associated infection of Salmonella and Salmonella Typhimurium in Roman geese (Anser anser domesticus) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus). In normal birds, the prevalence of Salmonella differed between species, and with age [e.g., 1-wk group, 37.5% (30/80) for ducks and 5.2% (6/116) for goslings (P < 0.05) vs. 4-wk group, 1% (1/96) for ducks and 12.1% (21/174) for geese]. Salmonella Typhimurium was identified from the visceral organs of moribund young geese suffering with colibacillosis and riemerellosis isolated from 2 goose farms (farm A and B, respectively). At farm B, 22.9% (27/118) of 4-wk geese with diarrhea were Salmonella Typhimurium-positive compared with 4.6% (8/174) of 4-wk normal geese. All Salmonella Typhimurium strains except one harbored a 94.7-kb virulence plasmid. Subcutaneous injection of Salmonella Typhimurium isolate 91NGL1 resulted in different clinical signs and pathogenesis between ducks and geese. In addition, the mean infectivity dose ratios of ducks to geese were 3.2 and 85.0 for 4- and 12-d birds, respectively, suggesting that goslings were more susceptible to Salmonella Typhimurium and resistance to Salmonella Typhimurium increased with age, especially for ducks. Therefore, Salmonella Typhimurium infection should be more common in goose farms than in duck farms, especially in the younger birds.
704	18631261	Geographical gradients in the population dynamics of North American prairie ducks.	Saether BE, Lillegard M, Grotan V, Drever MC, Engen S, Nudds TD, Podruzny KM	J Anim Ecol	 2008 Sep;77(5):869-82	 doi: 101111/j1365-2656200801424x Epub 2008 Jul 8	1. Geographic gradients in population dynamics may occur because of spatial variation in resources that affect the deterministic components of the dynamics (i.e. carrying capacity, the specific growth rate at small densities or the strength of density regulation) or because of spatial variation in the effects of environmental stochasticity. To evaluate these, we used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate parameters characterizing deterministic components and stochastic influences on population dynamics of eight species of ducks (mallard, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, gadwall, northern shoveler, American wigeon, canvasback and redhead (Anas platyrhynchos, A. acuta, A. discors, A. strepera, A. clypeata, A. americana, Aythya valisineria and Ay. americana, respectively) breeding in the North American prairies, and then tested whether these parameters varied latitudinally. 2. We also examined the influence of temporal variation in the availability of wetlands, spring temperature and winter precipitation on population dynamics to determine whether geographical gradients in population dynamics were related to large-scale variation in environmental effects. Population variability, as measured by the variance of the population fluctuations around the carrying capacity K, decreased with latitude for all species except canvasback. This decrease in population variability was caused by a combination of latitudinal gradients in the strength of density dependence, carrying capacity and process variance, for which details varied by species. 3. The effects of environmental covariates on population dynamics also varied latitudinally, particularly for mallard, northern pintail and northern shoveler. However, the proportion of the process variance explained by environmental covariates, with the exception of mallard, tended to be small. 4. Thus, geographical gradients in population dynamics of prairie ducks resulted from latitudinal gradients in both deterministic and stochastic components, and were likely influenced by spatial differences in the distribution of wetland types and shapes, agricultural practices and dispersal processes. 5. These results suggest that future management of these species could be improved by implementing harvest models that account explicitly for spatial variation in density effects and environmental stochasticity on population abundance.
705	18628122	Avian olfactory receptor gene repertoires: evidence for a well-developed sense of smell in birds-	Steiger SS, Fidler AE, Valcu M, Kempenaers B	Proc Biol Sci	 2008 Oct 22;275(1649):2309-17	 doi: 101098/rspb20080607	Among vertebrates, the sense of smell is mediated by olfactory receptors (ORs) expressed in sensory neurons within the olfactory epithelium. Comparative genomic studies suggest that the olfactory acuity of mammalian species correlates positively with both the total number and the proportion of functional OR genes encoded in their genomes. In contrast to mammals, avian olfaction is poorly understood, with birds widely regarded as relying primarily on visual and auditory inputs. Here, we show that in nine bird species from seven orders (blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus; black coucal, Centropus grillii; brown kiwi, Apteryx australis; canary, Serinus canaria; galah, Eolophus roseicapillus; red jungle fowl, Gallus gallus; kakapo, Strigops habroptilus; mallard, Anas platyrhynchos; snow petrel, Pagodroma nivea), the majority of amplified OR sequences are predicted to be from potentially functional genes. This finding is somewhat surprising as one previous report suggested that the majority of OR genes in an avian (red jungle fowl) genomic sequence are non-functional pseudogenes. We also show that it is not the estimated proportion of potentially functional OR genes, but rather the estimated total number of OR genes that correlates positively with relative olfactory bulb size, an anatomical correlate of olfactory capability. We further demonstrate that all the nine bird genomes examined encode OR genes belonging to a large gene clade, termed gamma-c, the expansion of which appears to be a shared characteristic of class Aves. In summary, our findings suggest that olfaction in birds may be a more important sense than generally believed.
706	18601714	Opposing effects of D-aspartic acid and nitric oxide on tuning of testosterone production in mallard testis during the reproductive cycle.	Di Fiore MM, Lamanna C, Assisi L, Botte V	Reprod Biol Endocrinol	 2008 Jul 4;6:28	 doi: 101186/1477-7827-6-28	UNLABELLED: D-Aspartic acid (D-Asp) and nitric oxide (NO) play an important role in tuning testosterone production in the gonads of male vertebrates. In particular, D-Asp promotes either the synthesis or the release of testosterone, whereas NO inhibits it. In this study, we have investigated for the first time in birds the putative effects of D-Asp and NO on testicular testosterone production in relation to two phases of the reproductive cycle of the adult captive wild-strain mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) drake. It is a typical seasonal breeder and its cycle consists of a short reproductive period (RP) in the spring (April-May) and a non reproductive period (NRP) in the summer (July), a time when the gonads are quiescent. The presence and the localization of D-Asp and NO in the testis and the trends of D-Asp, NO and testosterone levels were assessed during the main phases of the bird's reproductive cycle. Furthermore, in vitro experiments revealed the direct effect of exogenously administered D-Asp and NO on testosterone steroidogenesis. METHODS: By using immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques, we studied the presence and the distributional pattern of D-Asp and NO in the testes of RP and NRP drakes. D-Asp levels were evaluated by an enzymatic method, whereas NO content, via nitrite, was assessed using biochemical measurements. Finally, immunoenzymatic techniques determined testicular testosterone levels. RESULTS: IHC analyses revealed the presence of D-Asp and NO in Leydig cells. The distributional pattern of both molecules was in some way correlated to the steroidogenic pathway, which is involved in autocrine testosterone production. Indeed, whereas NO was present only during the NRP, D-Asp was almost exclusively present during the RP. Consistently, the high testosterone testicular content occurring during RP was coupled to a high D-Asp level and a low NO content in the gonad. By contrast, in sexually inactive drakes (NRP), the low testosterone content in the gonad was coupled to a low D-Asp content and to a relatively high NO level. Consequently, to determine the exogenous effects of the two amino acids on testosterone synthesis, we carried out in vitro experiments using testis sections deriving from both the RP and NRP. When testis slices were incubated for 60 or 120 min with D-Asp, testosterone was enhanced, whereas in the presence of L-Arg, a precursor of NO, it was inhibited. CONCLUSION: Our results provide new insights into the involvement of D-Asp and NO in testicular testosterone production in the adult captive wild-strain mallard drake. The localization of these two molecules in the Leydig cells in different periods of the reproductive cycle demonstrates that they play a potential role in regulating local testosterone production.
707	18579205	Cadmium- and lead-induced apoptosis in mallard erythrocytes (Anas platyrhynchos).	Romero D, Hernandez-Garcia A, Tagliati CA, Martinez-Lopez E, Garcia-Fernandez AJ	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	 2009 Jan;72(1):37-44	 doi: 101016/jecoenv200805004 Epub 2008 Jun 24	Cadmium, lead and cadmium-lead (1:10) induced apoptosis were studied using mallard blood cells. The allowable range in concentrations were: 0.01-0.5, 0.1-5.0, and 0.01:0.10-0.50:5.00 mM, for cadmium, lead and cadmium-lead, respectively. The lowest EC(50) achieved was for cadmium (0.22+/-0.04 mM). Two doses from each treatment group were chosen to study apoptosis and the presence of metals in cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased as the concentration of metals increased. The percentage of cells with intracellular metals was high for both exposure levels and the quantity of intracellular metal was greater for exposure to high concentrations. Morphological alterations for all types of exposure were related to the diverse range of effects that these metals have on membranes. We suggest that the decrease in the number of erythrocytes observed in specimens suffering from lead and cadmium poisoning is related to the induction of apoptosis.
708	18568660	Evaluation of Newcastle disease virus immunoassays for waterfowl using a monoclonal antibody specific for the duck immunoglobulin light chain.	Kothlow S, Hauslaigner R, Kaspers B, Grund C	Avian Pathol	 2008 Jun;37(3):323-8	 doi: 101080/03079450802050671	In the present study a monoclonal antibody (mAb 14A3) was tested for its reactivity against serum immunoglobulin Y (IgY) of several waterfowl species, and subsequently for its applicability as anti-species antibody in common immunoassays. Western blot analyses demonstrated its broad cross-reactivity with the serum IgY light chain of different duck species: Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), white-winged wood duck (Asarcornis scutulatus), common pintail (Dafila acuta). Reactivity was also evident with IgY of two swan species--mute swan (Cygnus olor) and black-necked swan (Sthenelides melanocoryphus)--and two goose species--domestic goose (Anser anser var. domestica) and red-breasted goose (Rufibrenta ruficollis). Applying the mAb for Newcastle disease virus (avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 [APMV-1]) test systems, its functionality within indirect immunoassays was evaluated. Using APMV-1-positive sera of domestic geese and Muscovy ducks, mAb 14A3 facilitated specific staining of APMV-1-infected cells in an immunofluorescence test. In addition, it proved to be functional in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a western blot assay. Thus, the analysed mAb represents an attractive and versatile reagent that offers the opportunity to develop serological tests for waterfowl, allowing a high sample throughput using the ELISA technique or the fine analysis of humoral immune responses using the western blot.
709	18498950	Unusual brain composition in Crested Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f.d.)--including its effect on behavior and genetic transmission.	Cnotka J, Tiemann I, Frahm HD, Rehkamper G	Brain Res Bull	 2008 Jun 15;76(3):324-8	 doi: 101016/jbrainresbull200803009 Epub 2008 Apr 16	Crested Ducks (CR) occasionally show intracranial fat bodies. Additionally, behavioral abnormalities such as motor incoordination can be observed. Here, it is shown that a behavioral test helps to identify CR that have a problematical fat body. The ducks were put on their backs, and the time required for them to stand up was measured. Ten CR exhibited suboptimal motor coordination. The appropriateness of this test has been proved in a special breeding program. To investigate the influence of fat bodies on brain composition, an allometrical comparison of 26 CR brains with those of three uncrested duck breeds was done. The fat bodies of CR varied from 0.3% to 41% of total brain volume, but two CR did not show a fat body. CR with motor incoordination show significantly larger fat bodies and require significantly more time in the test than "normal" CR. Total brain volume was significantly larger in CR, but brain volume minus fat body was significantly smaller compared to reference breeds. Cerebellum, apical hyperpallium, tegmentum and olfactory bulb are significantly reduced in CR. Obviously the behavioral deficits cannot be explained by the existence of a fat body, but they could be explained by functionally suboptimal cerebella and tegmenta. Fat body size seems to be a decisive factor. The relationship between fat body and reduced structures is discussed. By breeding with test-selected ducks the hatching rate increased and the number of ducklings with malformations or motor incoordination decreased.
710	18496857	Ossification sequence of the avian order anseriformes, with comparison to other precocial birds.	Maxwell EE	J Morphol	 2008 Sep;269(9):1095-113	 doi: 101002/jmor10644	Ossification sequences are poorly known for most amniotes, and yet they represent an important source of morphogenetic, phylogenetic, and life history information. Here, the author describes the ossification sequences of three ducks, the Common Eider Somateria mollissima dresseri, the Pekin Duck Anas platyrhynchos, and the Muscovy Duck Cairina moschata. Sequence differences exist both within and among these species, but are generally minor. The Common Eider has the most ossified skeleton prior to hatching, contrary to what is expected in a subarctic migrant species. This may be attributed to a tradeoff between growth rate and locomotory performance. Growth rate is higher in hatchlings with more cartilaginous skeletons, but this may compromise locomotion. No major ossification sequence differences were observed in the craniofacial skeleton when compared with Galliformes, which suggests that the influence of adult morphology on ossification sequence might be relatively minor in many taxa. Galliformes and Anseriformes, while both highly ossified at hatching, differ in the location of their late-stage ossification centers. In Anseriformes, these are most often located in the appendicular skeleton, whereas in Galliformes they are in the thoracic region and form the ventilatory apparatus.
711	18484055	Bilateral seminoma in a duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Ganorkar AG, Kurkure NV	Avian Pathol	 1998;27(6):644-5	 doi: 101080/03079459808419397	A case of bilateral seminoma in an aged Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) is described. Both testes were enlarged. Historically, the testes revealed large irregular seminiferous tubules containing diffuse sheets of large round, hyperchromatic neoplastic spermatogenic cells. Mitotic figures were seen. The growth had spread diffusely in both testes with no normal tissue left. Occurrence of bilateral seminoma without metastasis to other organs is unusual.
712	18454809	Quantitative real-time PCR primer design, cDNA amplification and sequence analysis from 22 genes mainly associated with lipid metabolism in Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos) and Muscovy (Cairina moschata) ducks.	Herault F, Robert E, Diot C	Anim Genet	 2008 Jun;39(3):325-7	 doi: 101111/j1365-2052200801732x	Few genomic tools are available in ducks. To produce some new resources, we have designed Pekin (Anas platyrhynchos) and Muscovy (Cairina moschata) duck-specific primers for 22 genes involved mainly in lipid metabolism, and to a lesser extent in carbohydrate metabolism and other functions. Primers were designed according to duck sequences when available and otherwise from the corresponding conserved regions in chicken and human sequences. These primers allowed quantitative RT-PCR amplification of RNA from Pekin and Muscovy ducks. Amplified cDNA products from both species were sequenced and were found to be very similar to chicken sequences (about 94%). This work provides additional genomic resources and polymorphism information for some genes in duck species and represents a first step towards gene expression analyses in Pekin and Muscovy ducks.
713	18436655	Using amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis to differentiate isolates of Pasteurella multocida serotype 1.	Blehert DS, Jefferson KL, Heisey DM, Samuel MD, Berlowski BM, Shadduck DJ	J Wildl Dis	 2008 Apr;44(2):209-25	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-442209	Avian cholera, an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, kills thousands of North American wild waterfowl annually. Pasteurella multocida serotype 1 isolates cultured during a laboratory challenge study of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and collected from wild birds and environmental samples during avian cholera outbreaks were characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, a whole-genome DNA fingerprinting technique. Comparison of the AFLP profiles of 53 isolates from the laboratory challenge demonstrated that P. multocida underwent genetic changes during a 3-mo period. Analysis of 120 P. multocida serotype 1 isolates collected from wild birds and environmental samples revealed that isolates were distinguishable from one another based on regional and temporal genetic characteristics. Thus, AFLP analysis had the ability to distinguish P. multocida isolates of the same serotype by detecting spatiotemporal genetic changes and provides a tool to advance the study of avian cholera epidemiology. Further application of AFLP technology to the examination of wild bird avian cholera outbreaks may facilitate more effective management of this disease by providing the potential to investigate correlations between virulence and P. multocida genotypes, to identify affiliations between bird species and bacterial genotypes, and to elucidate the role of specific bird species in disease transmission.
714	18421496	Species differences in the sensitivity of avian embryos to methylmercury.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Klimstra JD, Stebbins KR, Kondrad SL, Erwin CA	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2009 Jan;56(1):129-38	 doi: 101007/s00244-008-9160-3 Epub 2008 Apr 18	We injected doses of methylmercury into the air cells of eggs of 26 species of birds and examined the dose-response curves of embryo survival. For 23 species we had adequate data to calculate the median lethal concentration (LC(50)). Based on the dose-response curves and LC(50)s, we ranked species according to their sensitivity to injected methylmercury. Although the previously published embryotoxic threshold of mercury in game farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) has been used as a default value to protect wild species of birds, we found that, relative to other species, mallard embryos are not very sensitive to injected methylmercury; their LC(50 )was 1.79 microg/g mercury on a wet-weight basis. Other species we categorized as also exhibiting relatively low sensitivity to injected methylmercury (their LC(50)s were 1 microg/g mercury or higher) were the hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus), lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), and laughing gull (Larus atricilla). Species we categorized as having medium sensitivity (their LC(50)s were greater than 0.25 microg/g mercury but less than 1 microg/g mercury) were the clapper rail (Rallus longirostris), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), chicken (Gallus gallus), common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), herring gull (Larus argentatus), common tern (Sterna hirundo), royal tern (Sterna maxima), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), great egret (Ardea alba), brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), and anhinga (Anhinga anhinga). Species we categorized as exhibiting high sensitivity (their LC(50)s were less than 0.25 microg/g mercury) were the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), white ibis (Eudocimus albus), snowy egret (Egretta thula), and tri-colored heron (Egretta tricolor). For mallards, chickens, and ring-necked pheasants (all species for which we could compare the toxicity of our injected methylmercury with that of published reports where methylmercury was fed to breeding adults and was deposited into the egg by the mother), we found the injected mercury to be more toxic than the same amount of mercury deposited naturally by the mother. The rank order of sensitivity of these same three species to methylmercury was, however, the same whether the methylmercury was injected or maternally deposited in the egg (i.e., the ring-necked pheasant was more sensitive than the chicken, which was more sensitive than the mallard). It is important to note that the dose-response curves and LC(50)s derived from our egg injections are useful for ranking the sensitivities of various species but are not identical to the LC(50)s that would be observed if the mother bird had put the same concentrations of mercury into her eggs; the LC(50)s of maternally deposited methylmercury would be higher.
715	18409087	Antimicrobial activity of cuticle and outer eggshell protein extracts from three species of domestic birds.	Wellman-Labadie O, Picman J, Hincke MT	Br Poult Sci	 2008 Mar;49(2):133-43	 doi: 101080/00071660802001722	1. The eggshell cuticle is the proteinaceous outermost layer of the eggshell which regulates water exchange and protects against entry of micro-organisms. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the cuticle may also reduce microbial contamination by providing a chemical defence. 2. Outer eggshell and cuticle protein was extracted from domestic chicken (Gallus gallus), duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and goose (Anser anser) eggs by HCl and urea treatment, respectively. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. 3. C-type lysozyme, ovotransferrin and ovocalyxin-32 were identified in all extracts by Western blotting. All extracts from all species demonstrated lysozyme enzymatic activity. Immobilised c-type lysozyme retained some enzymatic activity. Protein extracts demonstrated activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis suggesting the action of antimicrobial proteins in addition to lysozyme. 4. The results suggest that the antimicrobial outer eggshell and cuticle proteins present in a number of avian species may be a mechanism which enhances avian reproductive success.
716	18409086	Comparative antibacterial activity of avian egg white protein extracts.	Wellman-Labadie O, Picman J, Hincke MT	Br Poult Sci	 2008 Mar;49(2):125-32	 doi: 101080/00071660801938825	1. Egg white proteins from the eggs of domestic chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and goose (Anser anser) were analysed in order to compare the antimicrobial activity of these products. 2. Albumen from each species was sampled and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Antimicrobial activity and lysozyme activity were measured. 3. Ovotransferrin and ovalbumin were identified in all species while c-type lysozyme was present in chicken, turkey and duck egg white samples, but not in goose. 4. Galliformes appear to possess albumens with greater antimicrobial activity than those of the Anseriformes. This can be attributed to higher concentrations of ovotransferrin and the broad acting c-type lysozyme.
717	18359507	Duration of fertility and hatchability of the common duck (Anas platyrhynchos) in pure- or crossbreeding with Muscovy drakes (Cairina moschata).	Brun JM, Mialon-Richard MM, Sellier N, Batellier F, Brillard JP	Theriogenology	 2008 May;69(8):983-9	 doi: 101016/jtheriogenology200801015 Epub 2008 Mar 24	A total of 540 common duck dams were used for a comparison of duration of fertility and hatchability between eggs issued from common dams inseminated with sperm (175 x 10(6) dose(-1)) from either common (pure-breeding or PB) or Muscovy (crossbreeding or CB) drakes. Artificial inseminations (AI) were performed at 3 periods of the reproductive season (27-35, 39-43 and 49-56 weeks) with 2 alternate inseminations/period at 3-week intervals (one with semen from common and the other from Muscovy). Fertility was estimated from egg candling while early embryo mortality (EEM), medium embryo mortality (MEM) and late embryo mortality (LEM) was estimated on Days 0-6 (PB+CB), Days 7-25 (PB) or Day 28 (CB) of incubation, and after, respectively. Overall fertility from Days 2-12 after AI was 61.1% in PB and 42.8% in CB. The maximum duration of fertility (time interval between AI and last fertile egg) was 8.1 days in PB versus 6.4 days in CB (p<0.05). The age of the dam influenced this interval, particularly in PB, with a longer duration at 40 weeks compared to 50 (p<0.05). On average, EEM represented 2.5% of fertile eggs while MEM accounted for 5% of surviving embryos on Day 6 and LEM, for 11.5% of hatched eggs. MEM was significantly higher in CB (6.3%) compared to PB (3.9%; p<0.05). Overall, an increase in EEM and MEM was observed in both types of eggs at and after 50 weeks of age. An increase in EEM (regardless of dam's age) and in MEM (only in the oldest females) was observed with sperm storage duration. Sex ratio at hatching (49.2% males in PB vs. 53.0% in CB) was particularly unbalanced on the first fertile day (54.7% and 57.1%, respectively).
718	18342316	Myxozoan parasitism in waterfowl.	Bartholomew JL, Atkinson SD, Hallett SL, Lowenstine LJ, Garner MM, Gardiner CH, Rideout BA, Keel MK, Brown JD	Int J Parasitol	 2008 Aug;38(10):1199-207	 doi: 101016/jijpara200801008 Epub 2008 Feb 14	Myxozoans are spore-forming, metazoan parasites common in cold-blooded aquatic vertebrates, especially fishes, with alternate life cycle stages developing in invertebrates. We report nine cases of infection in free-flying native and captive exotic ducks (Anseriformes: Anatidae) from locations across the United States and describe the first myxozoan in birds, Myxidium anatidum n. sp. We found developmental stages and mature spores in the bile ducts of a Pekin duck (domesticated Anas platyrhynchos). Spores are lens-shaped in sutural view, slightly sigmoidal in valvular view, with two polar capsules, and each valve cell has 14-16 longitudinal surface ridges. Spore dimensions are 23.1 microm x 10.8 microm x 11.2 microm. Phylogenetic analysis of the ssrRNA gene revealed closest affinity with Myxidium species described from chelonids (tortoises). Our novel finding broadens the definition of the Myxozoa to include birds as hosts and has implications for understanding myxozoan evolution, and mechanisms of geographical and host range extension. The number of infection records indicates this is not an incidental occurrence, and the detection of such widely dispersed cases suggests more myxozoans in birds will be encountered with increased surveillance of these hosts for pathogens.
719	18337310	Restraint increases afebrile body temperature but attenuates fever in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Gray DA, Maloney SK, Kamerman PR	Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol	 2008 May;294(5):R1666-71	 doi: 101152/ajpregu008652007 Epub 2008 Mar 12	In mammals, procedures such as handling, restraint, or exposure to open spaces induces an increase in body temperature (T(b)). The increase in temperature shares some characteristics with pyrogen-induced fever and so is often called "stress fever." Birds also respond to acute handling with a stress fever, which may confound thermoregulatory studies that involve animal restraint. We have measured the T(b) responses of Pekin ducks on days when they were restrained and compared them to days when the birds remained unrestrained. Restraint induced a 0.5 degrees C increase in T(b) that was sustained for the entire 8 h of restraint. To determine whether the restraint-induced increase in T(b) is mediated by prostaglandins (PGs) we compared the T(b) responses during restraint after intraperitoneal injection with saline to the responses during restraint after injection with diclofenac sodium (15 mg/kg). There was no difference in response, suggesting that restraint affects T(b) by a PG-independent mechanism. We also compared the T(b) response to intramuscular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 microg/kg), a bacterial pyrogen, when the ducks were restrained or unrestrained. Despite T(b) being higher at the time of LPS injection when the ducks were restrained, the maximum temperature reached after LPS injection was higher, and the period that T(b) remained elevated was longer when the ducks were unrestrained. We conclude that restraint should be considered as a potential confounder in thermoregulatory studies in birds and presumably other species too.
720	18299894	Diversity of bird schistosomes in anseriform birds in Iceland based on egg measurements and egg morphology.	Skirnisson K, Kolarova L	Parasitol Res	 2008 Jun;103(1):43-50	 doi: 101007/s00436-008-0925-4	Radix balthica is the only freshwater mollusc in Iceland that has been found to be the intermediate host of ocellate furcocercariae. Infections are common. On average, 4.8% out of almost 7,000 snails examined during 2003-2006 were found to shed cercariae in late summer and autumn. Search for adult bird schistosome worms, eggs and miracidia in the intestines and in the nasal cavity of 110 water birds of the orders Gaviiformes (one species), Podicipediformes (one species) and Anseriformes (nine species) revealed 39 (35.5%) infected hosts. Exclusively, anseriform birds were infected. Based on morphological features and measurements of eggs, seven distinct bird schistosome species were detected in four of the bird species. Allobilharzia visceralis was found in 26.7% of the whooper swans Cygnus cygnus. In Anas platyrhynchos, the nasal Trichobilharzia sp. I (prevalence 73.3%) and the visceral Trichobilharzia sp. III (66.7%) were detected. In Mergus serrator, the distinct egg types of Trichobilharzia sp. IV and Trichobilharzia sp. V were found in 83.3% of examined birds. In Anser anser, also two different egg types were found: large eggs, referred to as Trichobilharzia sp. II (prevalence 54.2%), and the small eggs of Dendritobilharzia sp. (8.3%). Egg size and shape comparisons indicate that Trichobilharzia sp. III and T. franki might be the same species.

Wojcik E, Smalec E	Folia Biol (Krakow)	 2007;55(3-4):115-20	 doi: 103409/173491607781492588	The karyotype of the mallard duck, Anas platyrhynchos, was characterised on the basis of R and C bands. Chromosomal preparations obtained from in vitro blood lymphocyte cultures were RBG- and CBG-stained. The structures of nine and 14 pairs of chromosomes were analysed by the RBG and CBG chromosome banding techniques, respectively. The location of R bands, as well as the size and arrangement of constitutive heterochromatin blocks were determined. Ideograms of R and C banded patterns of the analysed chromosomes were drawn. The morphological makeup of the analysed chromosomes was assessed.
722	18214862	Effects of hypoxia on vertebrate blood vessels.	Russell MJ, Dombkowski RA, Olson KR	J Exp Zool A Ecol Genet Physiol	 2008 Mar 1;309(2):55-63	 doi: 101002/jez427	Hypoxia contracts mammalian respiratory vessels and increases vascular resistance in respiratory tissues of many vertebrates. In systemic vessels these responses vary, hypoxia relaxes mammalian vessels and contracts systemic arteries from cyclostomes. It has been proposed that hypoxic vasoconstriction in cyclostome systemic arteries is the antecedent to mammalian hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, however, phylogenetic characterization of hypoxic responses is lacking. In this study, we characterized the hypoxic response of isolated systemic and respiratory vessels from a variety of vertebrates using standard myography. Pre-gill/respiratory (ventral aorta, afferent branchial artery, pulmonary artery) and post-gill/systemic (dorsal and thoracic aortas, efferent branchial artery) from lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), chicken (Gallus domesticus) and rat (Rattus norvegicus) were exposed to hypoxia at rest or during pre-stimulation (elevated extracellular potassium, epinephrine or norepinephrine). Hypoxia produced a relaxation or transient contraction followed by relaxation in all pre-gill vessels, except for contraction in lamprey, and vasoconstriction or tri-phasic constriction-dilation-constriction in all pulmonary vessels. Hypoxia contracted systemic vessels from all animals except shark and rat and in pre-contracted rat aortas it produced a transient contraction followed by relaxation. These results show that while the classic "systemic hypoxic vasodilation and pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction" may occur in the microcirculation, the hypoxic response of the vertebrate macrocirculation is quite variable. These findings also suggest that hypoxic vasoconstriction is a phylogenetically ancient response.
723	19338226	Aythya fuligula--new host for Retinometra pittalugai Lopez-Neyra, 1932 (Cestoda, Hymenolepididae) recorded in Poland for the first time	Krolaczyk K, Kavetska KM, Kornyushin VV	Wiad Parazytol	 2008;54(4):335-7		During standard parasitological studies of the tufted duck Aythya fuligula (Linnaeus, 1758), obtained from fishermen from West Pomerania, three cestode specimens were found in the jejunum of hosts. They were determined as Retinometra pittalugai (Lopez-Neyra, 1932) on the basis of the cirrus's size, shape of stylet and rostellar hooks. This is the first record of this species in Poland, since this parasite was earlier recorded only in Anas platyrhynchos f. dom., Aythya marila, A. ferina and Bucephala clangula in Spain, in Kamchatka and in Novosibirsk.
724	18085166	Carbofuran poisoning in mallard ducks	Kupper J, Baumgartner M, Bacciarini LN, Hoop R, Kupferschmidt H, Naegeli H	Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd	 2007 Nov;149(11):517-20	 doi: 101024/0036-728114911517	Carbofurane, a pesticide from the group of carbamates, has been employed against soil nematodes on a small meadow at the lake of Lugano, Switzerland. On the next morning, the first cases of death involving a total of 19 mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) have been reported. By inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetycholine, carbamates lead to excessive activation of the parasympathicus. In addition, paralysis of skeletal muscles is caused by continued stimulation of neuromuscular junctions. Death may occur by asphyxia. In the present case report, the diagnosis of poisoning could be confirmed by the chemical detection of carbofuran in the stomach, blood, muscle and kidney tissue of the affected mallard ducks.
725	18084777	Sarcocystis sp. from the goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) and the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos): cyst morphology and ribosomal DNA analysis.	Kutkiene L, Sruoga A, Butkauskas D	Parasitol Res	 2008 Mar;102(4):691-6	 doi: 101007/s00436-007-0813-3 Epub 2007 Dec 15	By light microscopy, cysts of Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type I) from the goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) seemed filamentous with a smooth and thin (<1 microm) cyst wall. Ultrastructurally, the cyst wall surface was irregular with minute undulations of the primary cyst wall. These sarcocysts had type-1 cyst wall. Cystozoites were banana-shaped and measured 7.0-8.5 microm in length. By light microscopy, cysts of Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type II) from the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) were ribbon-shaped, very long, and thin. On the surface of the wall (up to 1.5 microm), they had palisade-like villar protrusions closely crowded together. Electron micrographs showed villar protrusions (up to 1.3 microm in length) different in size and shape. The latter had short microprojections especially obvious in the oblique sections. Cystozoites were slightly bent with blunt ends, broader at one end, and measured 13.0-16.1 x 1.8-2.5 microm. Phylogenetic analysis based on the comparison of partial 28S rRNR gene sequences of Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type II) derived from the mallard, Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type I) and Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type III) both derived from the white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) suggested that these sequences belonged to separate Sarcocystis species.
726	18065138	Tracheal resection and anastomosis in a mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) with traumatic segmental tracheal collapse.	Guzman DS, Mitchell M, Hedlund CS, Walden M, Tully TN Jr	J Avian Med Surg	 2007 Jun;21(2):150-7	 doi: 101647/1082-6742(2007)21[150:TRAAIA]20CO;2	A male mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) presented for examination for acute respiratory distress and lethargy. The duck had experienced recurrent episodes of respiratory distress since being attacked by a raccoon the previous year, resulting in neck lacerations. Diagnostic tests, including a complete blood count, plasma biochemical analysis, radiography, and tracheoscopy, revealed a collapsed trachea. Surgical correction of the collapsed tracheal segment resulted in resection of 9% of the total tracheal length and subsequent anastomosis. Tracheoscopy performed 2 and 3 months after surgery revealed a healthy mucosa, minimal reduction of the tracheal lumen in the area of anastomosis, and minimal suture granuloma formation.
727	18058032	Spring-harvested game birds in the Western James Bay region of Northern Ontario, Canada: the amount of organochlorines in matched samples of breast muscle, skin, and abdominal fat.	Tsuji LJ, Martin ID, Martin ES, LeBlanc A, Dumas P	Environ Monit Assess	 2008 Nov;146(1-3):91-104	 doi: 101007/s10661-007-0062-z Epub 2007 Dec 4	We examined matched-tissue samples (the right pectoral muscle plus the associated skin and fat was considered a breast portion) of 81 spring-harvested waterfowl and 19 summer-harvested godwits (Limosa spp.) to assess the potential of these water birds contributing to the body burden of PCBs and DDT noted in First Nation people of the western James Bay region, northern Ontario, Canada. In general, the dabbling ducks (mallard duck, Anas platyrhynchos; and northern pintail, A. acuta) had significantly lower percent lipid (gravimetrically determined) values in skin tissue, fat tissue, and breast muscle compared to the goose species (Canada goose, Branta canadensis; lesser snow goose, Chen caerulescens); godwits had percent lipid values not significantly different than ducks and geese. Also, the percent lipid values in skin for all species of birds examined approached those found in fat tissue. Organochlorine data were expressed as the amount (microg) of each contaminant per breast portion to show contaminant consumption in terms of typical and easily recognizable dietary portions; direct comparisons were made to acceptable daily intake (ADI) or tolerable daily intake (TDI) values as recommended by Health Canada. Significant differences in the amount of organochlorines between bird species for skin, fat tissue, and breast muscle samples were found. In general, breast portions from snow geese contained the least amount of organochlorines, followed by godwits (except for mirex) and then Canada geese; the dabbling ducks had the greatest amount of organochlorines on a breast portion basis. However, on average, no 60 kg person would exceed the calculated organochlorine ADI/TDI values consuming one breast portion (i.e., breast + associated skin and fat), but the maximum value of SigmaPCBs for skin tissue alone in male mallards (47 microg) was more than twice the ADI/TDI (18 microg/day); while, that in fat tissue alone (17 microg) approached the ADI/TDI. Thus, the consumption of dabbling ducks by children is an issue that should be explored further, if tissue other than breast muscle is eaten. Lastly, the consumption of waterfowl was a source of PCBs for people of Fort Albany and Kashechewan, but not DDT, as this organochlorine was infrequently detected.
728	17900574	Comparative expression of androgen receptor in the testis and epididymal region of roosters (Gallus domesticus) and drakes (Anas platyrhynchos).	Dornas RA, Oliveira AG, Dias MO, Mahecha GA, Oliveira CA	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2008 Feb 1;155(3):773-9	 doi: 101016/jygcen200708010 Epub 2007 Aug 25	The androgen receptor (AR) mediates the physiological actions of androgens, which play a crucial role in the maintenance of male reproductive function and fertility. Although the AR distribution pattern is well established in mammalian reproductive organs, information about the AR expression in the testes and epididymal region of birds is still scarce. To better clarify the pattern of AR expression in the avian male tract, we investigated the expression and precise cellular distribution of AR in the testis and epididymal region of roosters and drakes. AR expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In the testis, AR was found restricted to the nuclei of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and some myoid cells in both species. Within the epididymal region, AR was widely expressed in the epithelia of all segments, although with segment specific differences in intensity and cellular distribution. Stronger positivity for AR was found in the principal cells of the epididymal duct, followed by the rete testis epithelium and non-ciliated cells of the distal efferent ductules. Non-ciliated cells of the proximal efferent ductules epithelium showed the lowest immunostaining. Ciliated cells of both segments of the efferent ductules were negative for AR. The connective tissue of roosters presented fewer AR-positive cells when compared with drakes; despite the similar total number of cells in both species. In conclusion, cellular and segment specific differences in AR expression suggest difference in sensitivity to androgens among the ducts composing the epididymal region of roosters and drakes.
729	17886739	Terminal phase of bird schistosomiasis caused by Trichobilharzia regenti (Schistosomatidae) in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica).	Chanova M, Horak P	Folia Parasitol (Praha)	 2007 Jun;54(2):105-7		The terminal phase of the migration of Trichobilharzia regenti Horak, Kolarova et Dvorak, 1998 in the definitive host (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica) was studied 12-27 days post infection (p.i.). Brain meninges were the last part of the nervous system where the worms were detected before their occurrence in the nasal cavity. In meninges, the parasites started to feed on red blood cells. Then the worms occurred in the nasal mucosa 14-25 days p.i. and the first immature eggs appeared 15 days p.i. The fully developed miracidia were recorded in the eggs from 17 days p.i. and freely in the nasal mucosa 19 days p.i. Infiltrates of lymphocytes, later also eosinophils and heterophils around the eggs and free miracidia, were observed from 15 and 19 days p.i., respectively. The haemorrhages occurring from 17 days p.i., and the granulomas with lymphocytes, eosinophils and heterophils forming around the eggs from 22 days p.i. were the most apparent pathological changes of nasal tissue.
730	17874802	Estimation of chemical toxicity to wildlife species using interspecies correlation models.	Raimondo S, Mineau P, Barron MG	Environ Sci Technol	 2007 Aug 15;41(16):5888-94	 doi: 101021/es070359o	Ecological risks to wildlife are typically assessed using toxicity data for relatively few species and with limited understanding of differences in species sensitivity to contaminants. Empirical interspecies correlation models were derived from LD50 values for 49 wildlife species and 951 chemicals. The standard wildlife test species Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) were determined to be good surrogates for many species within the database. Cross-validation of all models predicted toxicity values within 5-fold and 10-fold of the actual values with 85 and 95% certainty, respectively. Model robustness was not consistently improved by developing correlation models within modes of action (MOA); however, improved models for neurotoxicants, carbamates, and direct acting organophosphorous acetylcholenesterase inhibiting compounds indicate that toxicity estimates may improve if MOA-specific models are built with robust datasets. There was a strong relationship between taxonomic distance and cross-validation prediction success (chi2 = 297, df = 12, p < 0.0001), with uncertainty increasing with larger taxonomic distance between the surrogate and predicted species. Interspecies toxicity correlations provide a tool for estimating contaminant sensitivity with known levels of uncertainty for a diversity of wildlife species.
731	17704370	Motor incoordination, intracranial fat bodies, and breeding strategy in Crested ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f.d.).	Cnotka J, Frahm HD, Mpotsaris A, Rehkamper G	Poult Sci	 2007 Sep;86(9):1850-5	 doi: 101093/ps/8691850	Some Crested ducks (CR) are burdened with an intracranial fat body that, depending on the size and location, may lead to varying degrees of motor incoordination. A behavioral test is proposed that helps to identify those CR individuals bearing the problematical fat body. The test consists of putting the ducks on their backs and measuring the time required to right themselves. This was repeated 13 times per animal, and means were calculated. The minimum time required was 0.5 s, and the maximum was 62.6 s. Individuals that show motor incoordination need more time than ducks without such problems (14.3 s in contrast to 1.2 s) and exhibit a larger intracranial fat body. Ducks used for breeding should require no more than approximately 1 to 2 s to right themselves. In an allometric comparison with 3 other domestic duck breeds, CR show a significantly smaller brain; specifically, the cerebellum, tegmentum, apicale hyperpallium, and olfactory bulb are reduced. The relationship between fat body and these structures was discussed.
732	17675860	Genomics of antiviral defenses in the duck, a natural host of influenza and hepatitis B viruses.	MacDonald MR, Veniamin SM, Guo X, Xia J, Moon DA, Magor KE	Cytogenet Genome Res	 2007;117(1-4):195-206	 doi: 101159/000103180	We review our progress using genomics approaches to examine key antiviral defenses of the White Pekin mallard duck, Anas platyrhynchos. Our interest stems from the fact that ducks are the natural host of avian influenza, and are an important animal model for hepatitis B research. First, we have conducted an expressed sequence tag (EST) project and identified more than 200 immune relevant genes in the duck. Our analysis of these genes allows us to evaluate the homology between ducks and their closest genetic model organism, the chicken. We have also constructed genomic and cDNA libraries from the same individual duck, allowing us to directly compare expressed sequences with those present in the genome. These resources allow us to determine the organization and expression of regions of the genome important in antiviral defenses. Here we examine the organization of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I region, the lectin immunoreceptors and Toll-like receptor 7. We discuss our research-in-progress in the context of the immune defense against viruses, particularly influenza.
733	17675140	Spring-harvested game birds from the western James Bay region of northern Ontario, Canada: organochlorine concentrations in breast muscle.	Tsuji LJ, Martin ID, Martin ES, LeBlanc A, Dumas P	Sci Total Environ	 2007 Oct 15;385(1-3):160-71	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv200706039 Epub 2007 Aug 6	Although studies have assessed organochlorine concentration in breast tissue (pectoral muscle) of fall-harvested game birds in Canada, data for spring-harvested game birds are limited, especially for remote sub-arctic areas. Taking into account that most traditional Aboriginal diets include a large number of spring-harvested game birds, there is a need to assess organochlorine concentration in spring-harvested water birds with respect to suitability for human consumption. We examined organochlorine concentrations in breasts of 20 mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), 20 northern pintails (A. acuta), 21 Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior), and 20 lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) harvested in the spring; summer-harvested shorebirds (godwits; Limosa spp.) were also assessed as these water birds are an important part of the game bird harvest for First Nation Cree of the western James Bay region of Ontario, Canada. The most frequently detected organochlorines in striated (pectoral) muscle were SigmaPCBs (sum of 14 congeners [CBs]) and SigmaDDT (sum of DDE and DDT) followed by SigmaCHL (sum of oxy-chlordane, cis- and trans-nonachlor) and hexachlorobenzene with beta-hexachlorocyclohexane being the least frequently detected. For organochlorines that had < or =70% of the samples with detectable concentrations of an organochlorine (i.e., CBs 105, 128, 156, 170, 180, 183, cis-nonachlor, DDT, and mirex), log-linear contingency modelling revealed that the dabbling ducks had significantly more than expected detectable concentrations of most organochlorines; by contrast, geese and shorebirds had significantly less than expected detectable concentrations of most organochlorines. ANOVA for organochlorines with frequency of detection > or =70% (i.e., Aroclor 1260, SigmaPCBs, CBs 118, 138, 153, 187, DDE, hexachlorobenzene, oxy-chlordane and trans-nonachlor) revealed significant differences between bird species: Breast tissue in snow geese contained significantly less organochlorines than Canada geese (Aroclor 1260, CBs 118, 138, and 153) and godwits (Aroclor 1260, CBs 138, 153); mallards had significantly higher concentrations compared to godwits (DDE, trans-nonachlor, and SigmaCHLs), Canada geese (oxy-chlordane and SigmaCHLs), and snow geese (oxy-chlordane, trans-nonachlor, SigmaCHLs); and pintails had elevated levels compared to snow geese (CB 153, oxy-chlordane, trans-nonachlor, and SigmaCHLs) and Canada geese (oxy-chlordane). However, none of the samples analyzed in the present study exceeded the consumption guideline for organochlorines in fish or poultry with most samples being orders of magnitude less than the consumption guideline even when compared to maxima. Thus, the present spring-harvested-game bird study supports previous studies of fall-harvested game birds that contend that pectoral muscle portions are safe to eat. Nevertheless, skin and fat associated with the breast muscle may be another matter.
734	17578695	AFLP fingerprinting for paternity testing in ducks.	Huang CW, Cheng YS, Rouvier R, Yang KT, Wu CP, Huang MC	Br Poult Sci	 2007 Jun;48(3):323-30	 doi: 101080/00071660701370459	1. The accuracy and reproducibility of AFLP fingerprinting was investigated in the duck (Anas Platyrhynchos), using a multicolour fluorescent labeling technique. The fluorescent labelling fragments were separated on a capillary electrophoresis-base ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. 2. A total of 337 AFLP peaks with 103 of them being polymorphic markers were generated by 16 sets consisting of EcoRI/TaqI primer pair combinations. The number and size range of AFLP polymorphisms detected per primer pair varied from 3 to 11 and 58 to 290 bp, respectively. About 30.6% (103/337) of AFLP peaks were detected polymorphisms, with an average of 6.4 polymorphic markers per primer pair. 3. The clear polymorphic peaks were amplified with EcoR+AC/Taq+AC primer combinations. The AFLP peaks showed high reproducibility. From the family testing, we found that the fingerprints of all the offspring were derived from one or other parent. Therefore, we conclude that AFLP fingerprinting might be a suitable method for duck paternity testing.
735	17576569	ANG II-induced attenuation of salt gland function in Pekin ducks is not catecholamine-dependent.	Butler DG	J Comp Physiol B	 2007 Oct;177(7):733-42	 doi: 101007/s00360-007-0170-7 Epub 2007 Jun 19	Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were bilaterally adrenalectomized (biADX), injected with 1 mg of triamcinolone (TRIAM) kg bw(-1) im and given 0.9% saline drinking water during a 24 h recovery period followed by chemical sympathectomy with 6OH DOPA 3 h before the start of experimental observations. Baseline plasma dopamine (DA) concentrations decreased from 283 +/- 88.5 pmol ml(-1) to 42.4 +/- 11.1 pmol ml(-1); epinephrine (E) from 142 +/- 46 pmol ml(-1) to 18.4 +/- 9.2 pmol ml(-1) and norepinephrine (NE) from 742 +/- 84 pmol ml(-1) to 406 +/- 38 pmol ml(-1) 1 day after biADX + TRIAM but before chemical sympathectomy. Baseline MABP increased from 132 +/- 3.2 mmHg to 209 +/- 14.3 mmHg (P < 0.05) in response to TRIAM. After chemical sympathectomy with 6OH DOPA there was an additional 90% decrease in plasma NE to 42 +/- 9.4 pmol ml(-1) and a concurrent 60% decrease in MABP to 83.4 +/- 6.9 mmHg (P < 0.05). Nasal fluid secretion was maintained by the continuous infusion of hypertonic saline (1,000 mosmol kg H(2)O(-1) at a rate of 0.3 ml kg(-1) min(-1)). Rates of nasal fluid secretion and fluid electrolyte concentrations were unchanged following biADX + TRIAM + 6OH DOPA. Angiotensin II (ANG II; dose 1 microg kg bw(-1) i.v.), attenuated nasal fluid secretion showing that the response to ANG II was not NE- dependent. Plasma NE concentrations decreased following Tyramine i.v. (33 +/- 8.5 pmol ml(-1)) there being no vasopressor response. This is the first report of the ANG II induced attenuation of duck salt gland secretion in the absence of measurable E and NE.
736	17552093	Surveillance of influenza A virus in migratory waterfowl in northern Europe.	Wallensten A, Munster VJ, Latorre-Margalef N, Brytting M, Elmberg J, Fouchier RA, Fransson T, Haemig PD, Karlsson M, Lundkvist A, Osterhaus AD, Stervander M, Waldenstrom J, Bjorn O	Emerg Infect Dis	 2007 Mar;13(3):404-11	 doi: 103201/eid1303061130	We conducted large-scale, systematic sampling of influenza type A virus in migratory waterfowl (mostly mallards [Anas platyrhynchos]) at Ottenby Bird Observatory, southeast Sweden. As with previous studies, we found a higher prevalence in fall than spring, and among juveniles compared with adults. However, in contrast to other studies, we found that prevalence in spring was sometimes high (mean 4.0%, highest 9.5%). This finding raises the possibility that ducks are capable of perpetuating influenza A virus of different subtypes and subtype combinations throughout the year and from 1 year to the next. Isolation of the H5 and H7 subtypes was common, which suggests risk for transmission to sensitive domestic animals such as poultry. We argue that wild bird screening can function as a sentinel system, and we give an example of how it could have been used to forecast a remote and deadly outbreak of influenza A in poultry.
737	17549551	Coaccumulation of cadmium and zinc in tissues of sentinel mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) using a former dredge-disposal impoundment.	Levengood JM, Skowron LM	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2007 Aug;53(2):281-6	 doi: 101007/s00244-005-0324-0 Epub 2007 Jun 1	Six- to eight-month-old female farm-raised mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were used to examine the accumulation of and association among cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) from an impoundment constructed to contain sediments dredged from a lake contaminated by a zinc smelter. Cd was not detectable in the livers t of farm-raised mallards (day 0), although sentinel mallards accumulated hepatic Cd in the first 7 days after release. By day 14, mean concentrations of Cd in kidneys (= 2.82 mg/kg wet weight) had increased 3.4-fold. The mean pancreatic Cd concentration increased 59% between days 7 and 14. Renal Zn increased nominally, whereas pancreatic Zn increased 63% in sentinel ducks after release. Hepatic Zn increased significantly in the first week of release. Renal and pancreatic Cu concentrations did not change significantly, whereas concentrations of Cu in livers of ducks increased 50% in the 7 days after release before decreasing by nearly the same degree. Concentrations of Cd and Zn were correlated in livers of sentinel mallards on days 7 and 14. Cd and Cu were not correlated in the tissues of any cohort. Cu and Zn were correlated in the livers of farm-raised mallards, in the pancreases of sentinel mallards at day 7, and in the kidneys of the ducks in all three treatments. The relationship between Cd and Zn in tissues of ducks in our study was complicated by simultaneous exposure to increased and heterogeneous concentrations of Cd and Zn, both of which can induce metallothionein and compete for this and other ligands.
738	17543406	Antimicrobial and safety aspects, and biotechnological potential of bacteriocinogenic enterococci isolated from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Sanchez J, Basanta A, Gomez-Sala B, Herranz C, Cintas LM, Hernandez PE	Int J Food Microbiol	 2007 Jul 15;117(3):295-305	 doi: 101016/jijfoodmicro200704012 Epub 2007 May 3	Samples from the intestinal content and carcasses of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were evaluated for enterococci with antimicrobial activity, presence of genes coding bacteriocins and their expression, and potential virulence factors. Enterococcus faecalis comprised the largest enterococcal species with antagonistic activity followed by E. faecium, E. hirae, Enterococcus spp., and the non-enterococci. Although all E. faecalis isolates manifested a potent direct antimicrobial activity, no activity was detected in supernatants of most producer cultures. However, all E. faecium isolates showed antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and encoded bacteriocins, although the occurrence in the isolates of several enterocin genes did not always correlate with a higher antagonistic activity in supernatants. The efaAfm determinant was the only virulence gene detected in E. faecium, while E. faecalis showed a larger number of virulence determinants, and E. hirae did not carry any of the virulence genes examined. The rapid identification of genes coding described bacteriocins permits recognition of isolates that are potentially producers of novel bacteriocins. Purification of the antimicrobial activity of E. hirae DCH5 and Lactococcus garvieae DCC43 revealed unique chromatographic fragments after MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, suggesting the antagonistic peptides were purified to homogeneity. Bacteriocinogenic E. faecium and E. hirae isolates may be considered hygienic for production of bacteriocins, and potentially safe due to their low incidence of potential virulence genes and susceptibility to most clinically relevant antibiotics. However, the presence among the enterococci of E. faecalis strains with a potent antagonistic activity and multiple virulence factors, raises concerns regarding their potential pathogenicity to consumers.
739	17539975	FISH mapping of 57 BAC clones reveals strong conservation of synteny between Galliformes and Anseriformes.	Fillon V, Vignoles M, Crooijmans RP, Groenen MA, Zoorob R, Vignal A	Anim Genet	 2007 Jun;38(3):303-7	 doi: 101111/j1365-2052200701578x	Karyotypes of chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus; 2n = 78) and mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos; 2n = 80) share the typical organization of avian karyotypes including a few macrochromosome pairs, numerous indistinguishable microchromosomes, and Z and W sex chromosomes. Previous banding studies revealed great similarities between chickens and ducks, but it was not possible to use comparative banding for the microchromosomes. In order to establish precise chromosome correspondences between these two species, particularly for microchromosomes, we hybridized 57 BAC clones previously assigned to the chicken genome to duck metaphase spreads. Although most of the clones showed similar localizations, we found a few intrachromosomal rearrangements of the macrochromosomes and an additional microchromosome pair in ducks. BAC clones specific for chicken microchromosomes were localized to separate duck microchromosomes and clones mapping to the same chicken microchromosome hybridized to the same duck microchromosome, demonstrating a high conservation of synteny. These results demonstrate that the evolution of karyotypes in avian species is the result of fusion and/or fission processes and not translocations.
740	17494604	Molecular epidemiologic studies on North American H9 avian influenza virus isolates from waterfowl and shorebirds.	Jackwood MW, Stallknecht DE	Avian Dis	 2007 Mar;51(1 Suppl):448-50	 doi: 101637/7536-032706R1	Because sequence data on H9 avian influenza virus (AIV) from wild birds are currently limited, we set out to determine the sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9 viruses circulating in North American waterfowl and shorebirds. In this study, we examined the HA gene from H9 AIV isolated from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled during 1998 and 1999 in Minnesota and ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) sampled during 2003 in Delaware and New Jersey. At these sites, the H9N2 subtype represented 12% and 4% of the avian influenza isolates from mallards in 1998 and 1999, respectively, and 8% of the AIVs isolated from shorebirds between 2000 and 2002. Sequences from these viruses were compared with sequences from H9 AIV isolated from commercial poultry and aquatic birds from North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East: four previously reported and three new clades were observed. Sequence data from the HA gene of North American waterfowl and shorebird isolates generated in this study most closely group with the Eurasian H9 viruses in the Y439 clade. In addition, the HA cleavage site (AASNR/G) and receptor binding site was identical to the representative virus of that group (DK/Hong Kong/Y439/97). Viruses in that clade are commonly found in ducks and chickens in Hong Kong and Korea. Positive evolutionary selection (dNonsynonymous > dSynonymous) was observed for the HA gene among the North American waterfowl and shorebird H9N2 viruses, indicating that the H9N2-type viruses are changing in their natural hosts.
741	17494599	Avian influenza virus screening in wild waterfowl in Norway, 2005.	Jonassen CM, Handeland K	Avian Dis	 2007 Mar;51(1 Suppl):425-8	 doi: 101637/7555-033106R11	The prevalence of influenza A virus infection, and the distribution of different subtypes of the virus, were studied in 604 geese and ducks shot during ordinary hunting 2005. The study was based upon molecular screening of cloacal swabs taken by the hunters. The sampling included the following species: greylag (Anser anser), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), wigeon (Anas penelope), teal (Anas crecca), goosander (Mergus merganser), tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), common scoter (Melanitta nigra), goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), and red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator). The samples found to be positive in the initial pan-influenza A virus reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were further subtyped by using a specific H5 RT-PCR and full-length RT-PCRs for the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase genes. None of the greylag samples (0/185) were positive for influenza Avirus, whereas 19.1% of the ducks (80/419) were positive. The prevalences of influenza A virus in the different duck species were as follows: mallard, 20.4% (58/284); wigeon, 12.5% (8/64); teal, 30.9% (13/42); goosander, 0% (0/5); tufted duck, 0% (0/4); common scoter, 14.3% (1/7); goldeneye, 0% (0/11); and red-breasted merganser, 0% (0/2). H5N1 subtype was found in one mallard and H5N2 subtype in another mallard and one teal. Sequencing of the HA gene identified all three viruses as low-pathogenic strains, closely related to low-pathogenic H5 influenza A viruses evidenced in recent years in Sweden and the Netherlands. The other subtypes identified included H1N1, H2, H3N2, H3N8, H6N1, H6N2, H6N8, H8N4, H9N2, H11N9, and H12 in mallards; H3N2, H6N2, H6N8, and H9N2 in teals; and H6N2 in wigeons and common scoter.
742	17403008	Genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci affecting carcass and meat quality traits in Beijing ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Huang Y, Haley CS, Wu F, Hu S, Hao J, Wu C, Li N	Anim Genet	 2007 Apr;38(2):114-9	 doi: 101111/j1365-2052200701571x	Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for carcass and meat quality traits were detected in a sample of 224 progeny from four males in line VI and 12 females in line V of Beijing ducks. These lines were selected for high body weight at 42 days of age (line VI) or high egg production at 360 days of age (line V). Traits were weights of the carcass, head, neck, shanks, wings, legs, thighs, breast, heart, liver, crop, gizzard, abdominal fat (AFW) and skin fat, as well as fat thickness in the tail, and pH value, shear force, drip loss (DL) (%) and cooking loss (CL) (%) of the breast. Using a half-sib analysis with a multiple QTL model, linkage between the carcass and meat quality traits and 95 microsatellite markers was investigated. Eight genome-wide significant QTL for weight of crop, skin fat, liver, neck, shanks, wings, DL were detected on linkage groups CAU4 and CAU6. One genome-wide suggestive QTL and one chromosome-wide significant QTL for weight of breast were found on CAU1 and CAU4 respectively. Fifteen chromosome-wide suggestive QTL influencing weight of AFW, breast, crop, heart, carcass, thighs, liver, shanks, gizzard, fat thickness in tail, DL (%) and CL (%) were mapped on CAU2, CAU4, CAU5, CAU6, CAU7, CAU10 and CAU13. In addition, two linked QTL for weight of liver and DL (%) were located on CAU2 and CAU7 respectively. The detection of QTL in ducks is a step towards identification of genes influencing these traits and their use for genetic improvement in this species.
743	17385558	Study on the species-specificity of Isospora michaelbakeri by experimental infection.	Tung KC, Liu JS, Cheng FP, Yang CH, Tu WC, Wang KS, Shyu CL, Lai CH, Chou CC, Lee WM	Acta Vet Hung	 2007 Mar;55(1):77-85	 doi: 101556/AVet55200718	Isospora michaelbakeri is one of the Isospora species most commonly found in the wild field, which can cause severe infection and mortality in young sparrows. In this study, we selected I. michaelbakeri (Chung Hsing strain) as a pathogen to orally inoculate russet sparrows (Passer rutilans), spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata), canary (Serinus canaria), Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora), chicken (Gallus domesticus), ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and BALB/c mice. The results indicated that I. michaelbakeri infected only russet sparrows. Infected sparrows displayed lethargy, muscular weakness and fluffy feathers, followed by rapid death. Liver and spleen enlargement was seen in the infected birds. Schizonts were identified in thin smears from the venous blood, enlarged livers and spleens. Histopathological examination revealed schizonts and merozoites from the liver and spleen of infected russet sparrows, but not from other species experimentally inoculated with I. michaelbakeri in the present study.

Frank T, Probst A, Konig HE, Walter I	Anat Histol Embryol	 2007 Apr;36(2):121-6	 doi: 101111/j1439-0264200600737x	The aim of this study was to investigate the special anatomical and topographical features of the syrinx in male adult stock ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The syrinx of the mallard is a tracheobronchial type, consisting of a tympanum, a pessulus, medial tympaniform membranes, interanular membranes, an interbronchial ligament (bronchidesmus), and bronchosyringeal cartilage semi-rings. Using a frozen sagittal section, it was possible to document the syringeal valve at the right lateral side of the tympanum. In the male stock duck the pessulus was massive and showed a longish oval, transparent area ventrally. The middle part of the pessulus had a nose-shaped process on its left side, on which the left medial tympaniform membrane originated. The left-sided, pear-shaped syringeal bulla was divided into a left major and right minor chamber by a double-walled, semilunar and opaque septum, approximately 5-6 mm in height. The first left and right C-shaped bronchosyringeal cartilage was more prominent than the other ones and showed partial ossification. In addition, the first left bronchosyringeal cartilage was obviously thicker than the right one. In conclusion, it can be stated that the syrinx in male adult mallards shows some notable specific anatomical features that might have an influence on vocalization. However, to understand the complex mechanism of vocalization in mallards, more investigations, especially obtained by sonography and endoscopy, will be needed.
745	17359270	A novel enteropathogenic, strongly haemolytic spirochaete isolated from pig and mallard, provisionally designated 'Brachyspira suanatina' sp. nov.	Rasback T, Jansson DS, Johansson KE, Fellstrom C	Environ Microbiol	 2007 Apr;9(4):983-91	 doi: 101111/j1462-2920200601220x	Atypical, strongly haemolytic porcine isolates of intestinal spirochaetes differing genetically from Brachyspira hyodysenteriae were identified and characterized. The isolates were subjected to culture and biochemical tests, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular analyses. None of four species-specific polymerase chain reaction systems targeting genes of B. hyodysenteriae gave a positive reaction. All the atypical porcine isolates were identical in their partial 16S rRNA and nox gene sequences with a previously described isolate from a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and differed only slightly from another mallard isolate. All these isolates were distinctly different from all currently recognized Brachyspira species. A challenge study was carried out using recently weaned pigs. Clinical signs and macroscopic changes consistent with swine dysentery were seen both in pigs given the atypical porcine isolate and in control pigs given the reference strain of B. hyodysenteriae (B204(R)). Pigs given the genetically similar isolate from a mallard became colonized and diarrhoea was observed. This is the first study indicating that Brachyspira isolates from mallard can infect pigs and induce diarrhoea. We propose that this atypical spirochaete genotype should be regarded as a new species within the genus Brachyspira, and be provisionally designated 'Brachyspira suanatina' sp. nov.
746	17331814	Development of avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors.	Pilarski JQ, Hempleman SC	Respir Physiol Neurobiol	 2007 Aug 1;157(2-3):393-402	 doi: 101016/jresp200701015 Epub 2007 Jan 30	Although avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) have been studied extensively in adults, the maturation of IPC CO(2) sensitivity during development is completely unknown. To begin investigating IPC development we asked two fundamental questions: (1) Are IPC capable of sensing CO(2) during early development, and, if so, how early- And, (2) does IPC CO(2) sensitivity during early development exhibit postnatal maturation compared to IPC discharge characteristics in adult ducks- We addressed these questions by recording from single IPC Anas platyrhynchos ducklings beginning approximately 6 h prior to internal pipping through 4 days of postnatal development. We then compared mean IPC discharge characteristics during early development with mean IPC activity from adult ducks greater than 12 weeks old. In total, we recorded 28 individual IPC from 5 ducklings and 12 adult ducks. Results show that IPC were capable of responding to rapid step changes in CO(2) before hatching occurred, during the paranatal developmental period. We also found that mean IPC activity during early development had increased peak discharge frequencies, greater spike frequency adaptation, and less tonic CO(2) sensitivity when compared to adults (P< or =0.05). These results suggest that during early development phasic IPC CO(2) sensitivity is fully developed, yet tonic IPC CO(2) sensitivity exhibits postnatal maturation possibly associated with hatching. These results also suggest that the mechanisms that underlie phasic and tonic IPC action potential discharge, and therefore the degree of partial spike frequency adaptation, may be independent processes with different developmental trajectories.
747	17326750	Amino acid and nucleotide sequence, adjacent genes, and heterologous expression of hiracin JM79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5, isolated from Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Sanchez J, Diep DB, Herranz C, Nes IF, Cintas LM, Hernandez PE	FEMS Microbiol Lett	 2007 May;270(2):227-36	 doi: 101111/j1574-6968200700673x Epub 2007 Feb 26	The primary structure of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5 was determined by combined amino acid and DNA sequencing. Nucleotide analysis of a 2838-bp DNA fragment of E. hirae DCH5 revealed five putative ORFs. The first orf (hirJM79) encodes a 74-amino-acid peptide containing an N-terminal signal peptide of 30 amino acids, followed by the amino acid sequence of the mature bacteriocin, hiracin JM79 (HirJM79), of 44 amino acids. The second orf (hiriJM79) encodes the putative immunity protein of HirJM79. Contiguous ORFs encode a putative mobilization protein (orfC), a relaxase/mobilization nuclease domain (orfD), and a hypothetical protein (orfE). The production and functional expression of HirJM79 by heterologous hosts suggest that hirJM79 is the minimum requirement for production of biologically active HirJM79, that HirJM79 is most likely externalized by the general secretory pathway or sec-dependent pathway, and that HiriJM79 is the immunity protein for HirJM79.
748	17317328	Molecular characterization of two metallothionein isoforms in avian species: evolutionary history, tissue distribution profile, and expression associated with metal accumulation.	Nam DH, Kim EY, Iwata H, Tanabe S	Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol	 2007 Apr;145(3):295-305	 doi: 101016/jcbpc200610012 Epub 2007 Jan 24	To characterize avian MTs, MT cDNAs were cloned from liver of cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Expression profiles of MT isoforms and relationships between metal accumulation and MT mRNA expression in tissues were also investigated. We succeeded in cDNA cloning of MT1/2 from cormorant and MT1 in mallard. DNA sequence of chicken MT1 was obtained from chicken (Gallus gallus) genomic database. Considering previous reports on avian MTs, birds possess at least two distinct MT isoforms. Comparison of genomic synteny among vertebrates and phylogenetic analysis of MT amino acid sequences revealed that avian MT1/2 are evolutionarily close to mammalian MT3. Messenger RNAs of both MT isoforms were detected in all the tissues/organs in cormorant and mallard. Liver was the primary organ for cormorant MT1/2, and mallard MT2, whereas MT1 was dominant in mallard heart. Interspecies comparison of tissue distribution of MT mRNA expression between cormorant and mallard indicated that MT2 profile was similar, but MT1 was not. Significant positive correlations of mRNA expression levels between MT1 and MT2 were observed in the liver and kidney of cormorants, whereas no correlation was found in mallards. Expression levels of cormorant MT1/2 showed significant positive correlations with hepatic Cu and Zn concentrations, suggesting that both MT isoforms were induced by Cu and Zn in livers. Cormorant MT2 expression level exhibited a significant positive correlation with hepatic Ag, and a negative correlation with Rb, indicating that Ag and Rb concentrations depend on the expression of MT2 by Cu and Zn. In mallard, MT1 had no correlation with any metal concentration, and MT2 expression was positively correlated only with Cu, even though hepatic Cu and Zn concentrations in mallard were much higher than in cormorant. This may indicate that cormorant is a more susceptible species than mallard in terms of MT induction. These findings suggest tissue-, species-, and MT isoform-specific responses to metal stresses in these aquatic birds.
749	17253115	Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene: a simple method for identification of poultry meat species.	Girish PS, Anjaneyulu AS, Viswas KN, Santhosh FH, Bhilegaonkar KN, Agarwal RK, Kondaiah N, Nagappa K	Vet Res Commun	 2007 May;31(4):447-55	 doi: 101007/s11259-006-3390-5	Chicken (Gallus gallus), duck (Anas platyrhynchos), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and quail (Coturnix japonica) are the common poultry species consumed as meat throughout the world. In this work, a molecular technique has been developed for identification and differentiation of meat originating from these species. This tool helps in detection of misrepresentation of different poultry meats. The technique involves the extraction of DNA from the given sample, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene using universal primers, restriction analysis with selected restriction enzymes, followed by identification of meat species based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern. In this study, we used HinfI, Mph1 103I, MvaI, and Eco47I to identify and differentiate to poultry species referred to above. This species identification technique has also been applied successfully to processed meat products including those cooked at 120 degrees C for 30 min. Simplicity of interpretation of results combined with versatility makes this a convenient and appropriate technique in the hands of meat analysts for identifying poultry meat species.
750	17235030	Technical note: detection of chicken, turkey, duck, and goose tissues in feedstuffs using species-specific polymerase chain reaction.	Martin I, Garcia T, Fajardo V, Lopez-Calleja I, Rojas M, Pavon MA, Hernandez PE, Gonzalez I, Martin R	J Anim Sci	 2007 Feb;85(2):452-8	 doi: 102527/jas2006-350	PCR method was applied for the qualitative identification of chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallipavo), duck (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina muschata), and goose (Anser anser) tissues in feed-stuffs, on an individual basis. The assay uses oligonucleotide primers that are specific for each avian species, targeting the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene. The primers designed generated amplicons of 95, 122, 64, and 98 bp length for chicken, turkey, duck, and goose, respectively. The specificity of the primers was tested against 29 animal species including mammals, birds, and fish, as well as 8 plant species. Analysis of experimental feedstuffs demonstrated the detection of each target species in the range of 0.1 to 100%. The performance of this method was not affected by prolonged heat-treatment (up to 133 degrees C for 20 min at 300 kPa), and consequently, it could be very useful for the accurate identification of tissues from these 4 avian species in products submitted to denaturing technologies, for which other methods cannot be applied.
751	17230398	Predicting resource partitioning and community organization of filter-feeding dabbling ducks from functional morphology.	Gurd DB	Am Nat	 2007 Mar;169(3):334-43	 doi: 101086/510924 Epub 2007 Jan 17	Resource partitioning due to interspecific differences in phenotype is a key component of ecological and evolutionary theory, but the relationship between morphology and resource use is poorly understood for most species. In addition, ecologists often assume that morphological differences cause distinct resource preferences between species. Using mechanistic models that combine bill morphology and kinetics, I show that filter-feeding dabbling ducks face a morphology-mediated trade-off between particle size selection and water filtration rate. When detritus is absent, mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern shovelers (Anas clypeata) should maximize their intake rates and exhibit high overlap in prey size. When prey and detritus co-occur, species should separate prey from detritus by size, leading to reduced intake rates and size-based prey partitioning. Models for both species correctly predicted variation in water filtration rates, particle retention probabilities, and prey ingestion rates due to variation in prey size, the presence of detritus, and experimental modification of bill morphology. Because species have both shared and distinct resource preferences, duck communities should exhibit strong density-dependent niche shifts (i.e., centrifugal dynamics), a finding that contradicts previous studies that assumed that ducks have distinct resource preferences only. Centrifugal dynamics may be widespread among filter feeders because of the common cost of separating prey from detritus.
752	17215160	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA encoding thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-subunit of common duck and mule duck pituitaries: in vitro regulation of steady-state TSHbeta mRNA level.	Hsieh YL, Chowdhury I, Chien JT, Chatterjee A, Yu JY	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 2007 Mar;146(3):307-17	 doi: 101016/jcbpb200611018 Epub 2006 Nov 29	For better understanding of phylogenetic diversity and evolution of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in birds, we have cloned the cDNAs encoding TSH beta subunit (TSHbeta), by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) from two species of domestic ducks, common duck (Tsaiya duck and Pekin duck) (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and mule duck (hybrid of male muscovy duck Cairina moschata and female A. platyrhynchos domesticus). The nucleotide sequences of isolated TSHbeta cDNAs of the two species of ducks are identical, with each including 66 bp of 5'-untranslated region (UTR), 402 bp of coding region, and 82 bp 3'-UTR followed by 18 bp poly A tract. The deduced TSHbeta subunit of the ducks contains 134 amino acids consisting of a putative signal peptide of 19 amino acids and a putative mature protein of 115 amino acids. However, the TSHbetas of common duck and mule duck differ from the TSHbeta of muscovy duck in one amino acid at position 97 of the mature protein: isoleucine for common duck and mule duck, and valine for muscovy duck. Our findings thus demonstrate that inter-genus variation of TSHbeta exists in Family Anatidae, and that TSHbeta gene in the mule duck is preferentially transcribed from the maternal genome rather than from the paternal genome. TSHbeta mRNA expressions were investigated by culturing common duck pituitaries with various doses of hormones. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulated, while thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)), inhibited the TSHbeta mRNA levels, in dose-related manners. The findings thus support that the mode of regulation of TSH gene expression in hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis in birds is similar to that in mammals. Cortisol and corticosterone decreased the steady-state TSHbeta mRNA levels at the pituitary level, in a dose-related manner, the first-time demonstration in vertebrates. The results may suggest that glucocorticoids exert suppressive action directly at pituitary level in modulation of steady-state TSHbeta mRNA level.
753	17184349	Prior knowledge about spatial pattern affects patch assessment rather than movement between patches in tactile-feeding mallard.	Klaassen RH, Nolet BA, VAN Leeuwen CH	J Anim Ecol	 2007 Jan;76(1):20-9	 doi: 101111/j1365-2656200601184x	1. Heterogeneity in food abundance allows a forager to concentrate foraging effort in patches that are rich in food. This might be problematic when food is cryptic, as the content of patches is unknown prior to foraging. In such case knowledge about the spatial pattern in the distribution of food might be beneficial as this enables a forager to estimate the content of surrounding patches. A forager can benefit from this pre-harvest information about the food distribution by regulating time in patches and/or movement between patches. 2. We conducted an experiment with mallard Anas platyrhynchos foraging in environments with random, regular, and clumped spatial configurations of full and empty patches. An assessment model was used to predict the time in patches for different spatial distributions, in which a mallard is predicted to remain in a patch until its potential intake rate drops to the average intake rate that can be achieved in the environment. A movement model was used to predict lengths of interpatch movements for different spatial distributions, in which a mallard is predicted to travel to the patch where it expects the highest intake rate. 3. Consistent with predictions, in the clumped distribution mallard spent less time in an empty patch when the previously visited neighbouring patch had been empty than when it had been full. This effect was not observed for the random distribution. This shows that mallard use pre-harvest information on spatial pattern to improve patch assessment. Patch assessment could not be evaluated for the regular distribution. 4. Movements that started in an empty patch were longer than movements that started in a full patch. Contrary to model predictions this effect was observed for all spatial distributions, rather than for the clumped distribution only. In this experiment mallard did not regulate movement in relation to pattern. 5. An explanation for the result that pre-harvest information on spatial pattern affected patch assessment rather than movement is that mallard move to the nearest patch where the expected intake rate is higher than the critical value, rather than to the patch where the highest intake rate is expected.
754	17177058	Trichobilharzia szidati: the lung phase of migration within avian and mammalian hosts.	Chanova M, Vuong S, Horak P	Parasitol Res	 2007 May;100(6):1243-7	 doi: 101007/s00436-006-0398-2 Epub 2006 Dec 20	The passage of Trichobilharzia szidati schistosomula through the vertebrate lungs was examined in natural and abnormal hosts--birds (ducks Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica) and mammals (mice Mus musculus Bagg albino/c [BALB/c]), respectively. Using the methods of classical histology, the migratory route of worms was characterized, and the impact of migration on host tissues and the host cell reactions were evaluated. Living schistosomula were recorded in the lungs of ducks 2-10 days post infection (p.i.) and in the lungs of mice 2-4 days p.i. In ducks, the schistosomula migrated from the blood vessels through the blood capillaries to the lung tissue; then, they entered free air space of the lungs. The infection resulted in inflammatory reaction with nodules composed of infiltrated lymphocytes, heterophils, eosinophils and macrophages. These structures were formed around the blood vessels and in the gas-exchange tissues of the parabronchial walls and, consequently, in the walls of secondary bronchi. An extensive inflammation of secondary bronchi and parabronchi was observed. In the lungs of mice, the parasites were localized extravascularly in the alveolar walls. No migratory pattern similar to that in the lungs of ducks was recorded. No specific inflammatory reaction occurred. However, alveolar wall congestion, edema and lymphocyte infiltrates appeared and, therefore, pathogenicity of T. szidati was also confirmed in the murine host.
755	17166697	Effects of the herbicide Roundup on the epididymal region of drakes Anas platyrhynchos.	Oliveira AG, Telles LF, Hess RA, Mahecha GA, Oliveira CA	Reprod Toxicol	 2007 Feb;23(2):182-91	 doi: 101016/jreprotox200611004 Epub 2006 Nov 11	Exposure to the Roundup has been shown to affect StAR protein and aromatase expression and activity, pointing out that this herbicide may cause adverse effects in animal reproduction by affecting androgen and estrogen synthesis. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the in vivo effects of the Roundup on the testis and epididymal region of drake Anas platyrhynchos. The exposure to the herbicide resulted in alterations in the structure of the testis and epididymal region as well as in the serum levels of testosterone and estradiol, with changes in the expression of androgen receptors restricted to the testis. The harmful effects were more conspicuous in the proximal efferent ductules and epididymal ducts, suggesting higher sensitivity of these segments among the male genital organs. The effects were mostly dose dependent, indicating that this herbicide may cause disorder in the morphophysiology of the male genital system of animals.
756	17161174	The exceptionally rare (sic) Common Scoter.	Gales H, Fisher R	J Pediatr Surg	 2006 Dec;41(12):e25-7	 doi: 101016/jjpedsurg200609065	A 1-month-old infant with congenital heart disease underwent initial cardiac surgery (Mee Shunt) at day 20 but was later readmitted because of poor shunt flow and hypoxemia. Despite therapy, the infant deteriorated and suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest. After 40 minutes of resuscitation, spontaneous cardiac output was reestablished, and subsequently, the child was placed on extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygen (ECMO) support. The infant deteriorated further over the next 3 days with persistent acidosis, marked abdominal distension associated with significant nasogastric aspirates, and the passage of small amounts of bloodstained stool. The presumed diagnosis was necrotizing enterocolitis, and despite the grave prognostic indicators, the decision was taken to undertake laparotomy. At surgery, there was 350 mL of unclotted venous blood in the peritoneal cavity. The bowel was grossly normal. A ruptured, infarcted, hemorrhagic spleen was discovered to be the cause of the bleeding. A splenectomy was performed, and the child made rapid recovery, sufficiently well to undergo redo Mee shunt 2 days later. A splenic infarct was confirmed at pathological examination. The cause of the splenic infarct and rupture is uncertain in this baby but may have been related to either cardiopulmonary resuscitation and/or ECMO. The importance of this case is the similarity in presentation in a baby with congenital heart disease between necrotizing enterocolitis (which is relatively common) and hemoperitoneum secondary to splenic rupture (which is very rare). Medical practice contains many useful maxims such as, "What walks like a duck, talks like a duck, is often a duck." This case demonstrates that not all ducks are the common Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) but occasionally the exceptionally rare (sic) Common Scoter (Melanitta nigra). The management of neonatal cardiac patients on ECMO therapy continues to be a challenge, and particular diagnostic rigor should be applied in their care.
757	17156094	Histological aspects of the syrinx of the male mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Frank T, Walter I, Probst A, Konig HE	Anat Histol Embryol	 2006 Dec;35(6):396-401	 doi: 101111/j1439-0264200600701x	The syrinx of the duck is characterized by a conspicious sexual dimorphism. In the male mallard, a large osseous bulla is present on the left syringeal side. The present work describes the structures of the male syrinx, which were studied by means of histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscope. In the right distal tympanum a caudally oriented, protruding structure was observed, which was identified as the valvula syringealis. The syringeal structures like valvula, tympanum, bulla, pessulus and the bronchi were in general covered by a respiratory epithelium, however, local modifications in cellular height and numbers of ciliated and goblet cells were observed. The presence of intrinsic musculature was confirmed by means of immunohistochemistry. Smooth muscle cells reaching from the lateral parts of the inter-bronchial ligament to the medial line and cranially to the inner tympaniform membranes were demonstrated. We suppose that these muscle cells play a role in syringeal sound generation by influencing the tension of the medial tympaniform membranes.
758	17023601	Downregulation of aquaporins 1 and 5 in nasal gland by osmotic stress in ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos: implications for the production of hypertonic fluid.	Muller C, Sendler M, Hildebrandt JP	J Exp Biol	 2006 Oct;209(Pt 20):4067-76	 doi: 101242/jeb02491	Using primers against highly conserved regions of mammalian and bird aquaporins in RT-PCR experiments, we amplified products derived from duck (Anas platyrhynchos) nasal gland RNA that were identified as homologues of mammalian and chicken aquaporin 1 and aquaporin 5 cDNAs by sequencing. Using digoxigenin-labelled probes derived from these PCR products in northern blot analyses of mRNA isolated from nasal glands of untreated (naive) or osmotically stressed ducklings (replacement of drinking water with a 1% NaCl solution), we observed a decrease in aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and aquaporin 5 (AQP5) mRNA abundance (by approximately 40%) during saline adaptation in the animals. Western blot analysis of AQP1 and AQP5 expression in the glands revealed that protein abundance decreased in a similar fashion. Immunohistochemical analysis of AQP1 distribution in cryosections of nasal gland indicated that AQP1 is mainly expressed in endothelial cells of the capillaries, but definitely not in the secretory or ductal cells of the gland. AQP5 distribution in the gland, however, seems to be different, since staining was exclusively observed in apical and basolateral plasma membranes of individual epithelial cells of the primary and central ducts, which collect fluid from the secretory tubules. The observations are consistent with the hypothesis that strongly hyperosmotic fluid is produced by the secretory cells at very low (unstimulated gland) or high (activated gland) rates. In the unstimulated gland, secretions may be diluted by aquaporin-mediated transcellular water flux while passing through the ductal system flushing the glandular ducts, thereby potentially preventing ascending infections. In the activated gland, however, downregulation of aquaporins in capillaries and duct cells may prevent dilution of the initially secreted fluid, enabling the animals to excrete large volumes of a highly concentrated salt solution.
759	16989964	Developmental changes of FSH-R, LH-R, ER-beta and GnRH-I expression in the ovary of prepubertal ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Ni Y, Zhou Y, Lu L, Grossmann R, Zhao R	Anim Reprod Sci	 2007 Aug;100(3-4):318-28	 doi: 101016/janireprosci200608012 Epub 2006 Aug 8	Normal ovarian development is dependent on stimulation of the gonadotropic hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), as well as some regulatory factors locally produced in ovary, e.g. 17beta-estradiol (E2) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), mediated by their respective receptors. In order to elucidate the potential roles of LH, FSH, E2 and GnRH-I during early follicular development in prepubertal ducks, mRNA expression of LH-R, FSH-R, ER-beta and GnRH-I in ovaries of 1-day-old (D1), 30-day-old (D30), 60-day-old (D60) and 90-day-old (D90) ducks was measured with semi-quantitative RT-PCR using beta-actin as an internal standard. The ovary index (the ratio of ovary weight/body mass) did not change from D30 to D90, while the ovary weight and serum E2 levels rose progressively, indicating the prepubertal development of the ovary. Ovarian expression of FSH-R, LH-R, ER-beta and GnRH-I mRNA changed greatly during this period. Abundance of FSH-R and ER-beta mRNA went up gradually from D1 to D60, followed by a decline on D90. LH-R and GnRH-I mRNA expression increased from D1 to D90, reaching a peak at D90. These results indicate that the developing ovary is highly responsive to the regulation of FSH during the early stage, while close to the onset of sexual maturation, the ovary is likely more responsive to LH. In addition, the expression of GnRH-I and ER-beta mRNA in the ovary suggest that GnRH-I and E2 are involved in the regulation of prepubertal follicular development in the ovary of ducks.
760	16940624	Are nasal Trichobilharzia cercariae potential threath to human health-	Skirnisson K, Kolarova L	Laeknabladid	 2002 Oct;88(10):739-44		During late summer in 1995 to 1997, repeated outbreaks of maculopapular skin eruptions were observed on legs of children after wading in the pond of the Family Park in Reykjavik, Iceland. Investigation, starting in autumn 1997, revealed that the causative agent was a previously undescribed schistosome cercaria of the genus Trichobilharzia, shed by Radix peregra, the only snail occurring in the pond. This was the first report of swimmer's itch in Iceland. Infection experiments with cercariae from the pond have revealed adult worms and eggs of a Trichobilharzia in the nasal area of ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos f.dom.) 18-23 days p.i., and schistosomula in the spinal cord of BALB/c mice 3, 6 and 10 days p.i. Moreover, a mouse killed 3 days p.i. also had schistosomula in the lungs. During the prepatent period the infected ducklings had neuromotoric symptoms and gross pathology revealed petechiae in the nasal cavity. The results indicate that the cercaria responsible for swimmer's itch in Iceland is a nasal schistosome. Furthermore, adults of two visceral Trichobilharzia species have been found in Icelandic whooper swans Cygnus cygnus. As schistosomula of both nasal and visceral Trichobilharzia species are able to develop and migrate for several days in a non-specific mammalian host, humans are warned to expose themselves to Trichobilharzia cercariae in Iceland.
761	16938296	Influences of sex and saline intake on diurnal changes in plasma melatonin and osmoregulatory hormones of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Hughes MR, Bennett DC, Gray DA, Sharp PJ, Poon AM	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 2006 Nov;149(2):124-33	 doi: 101016/jygcen200604001 Epub 2006 Aug 30	Melatonin (MT) inhibits salt gland secretion of Pekin ducks [Ching, A.C.T., Hughes, M.R., Poon, A.M.S., Pang, S.F., 1999. Melatonin receptors and melatonin inhibition of duck salt gland secretion. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 116, 229-240]. The present study examined simultaneous diurnal changes in plasma concentrations of MT and four osmoregulatory hormones of Pekin ducks to assess the possible interactions among these hormones that might contribute to inhibition of extrarenal salt secretion. The study compared diurnal changes in freshwater (FW) and saline-acclimated (SA) male and female ducks. We hypothesized plasma concentrations of osmoregulatory hormones: (1) differ between sexes (partially accepted); (2) vary diurnally (accepted, influenced by sex and treatment); (3) are correlated with MT (partially accepted); and their diurnal variation is affected by (4) sex (partially accepted); and (5) saline acclimation (partially accepted). We compared body mass, plasma osmolality (Osm(pl)), plasma volume, concentrations of plasma ions, and arginine vasotocin (AVT), angiotensin II (AII), prolactin, (PRL), and aldosterone (ALDO), in relation to plasma melatonin (MT). At night body mass increased in FW ducks and decreased in SA ducks. This likely reflects the higher plasma PRL concentration of female ducks and its middark increase only in SA ducks. Plasma volume increased at night in all but FW males. Plasma sodium and osmolality were higher in SA ducks and did not vary diurnally in either FW or SA ducks. Midday MT did not differ between males and females or between FW and SA ducks; at middark, all ducks, except FW females, increased MT. Midday AVT was higher in SA ducks. Only FW ducks increased AVT at middark. Changes in AVT and MT were positively correlated in males and negatively correlated in females. Males had higher AII and, at night, AII increased in SA ducks and decreased in FW ducks. AVT and AII were negatively correlated. ALDO was highly correlated with AII and unaffected by sex, saline, or time. At night, only AVT was elevated in FW ducks, while MT, AII, and PRL were elevated in SA ducks. FW and SA ducks appear to follow different, but equally effective, hormonal strategies to maintain osmotic homeostasis at night. We conclude that the effect of MT on salt gland secretion is probably a direct effect. These may be influenced by gender.
762	16930702	Enhancer and promoter activity in the JH to IGHM intron of the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Lundqvist ML, McElveen BR, Middleton DL, Warr GW	Dev Comp Immunol	 2007;31(3):286-95	 doi: 101016/jdci200606004 Epub 2006 Aug 4	A transcriptional enhancer, Emu, was defined in the IGH locus of the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos. Regions of DNA from the JH to IGHM intron were cloned into reporter constructs containing the SV40 promoter and transiently transfected into chicken B and T lymphocytes. A strong transcriptional activity, of several hundred-fold greater than that of a reporter construct with the promoter alone, was localized to a 281bp region that contains 2 E-box motifs, CAGCTG. This fragment showed enhancer activity in both orientations and was active in chicken B cells but not in T cells. When the activity of the enhancer was tested in constructs without a promoter, it showed high transcriptional activity in the forward orientation, but much less activity (by two orders of magnitude) when tested in the reverse orientation. This suggests that the fragment contains not only enhancer activity but may contain promoter activity analogous to that of the Imu promoter described in mammals. Thus it appears that the location, but not the fine structure, of the Emu enhancer was established before the evolutionary divergence of the avian and mammalian lineages some 300Myr ago.
763	16919729	Immune gene discovery by expressed sequence tag analysis of spleen in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Xia J, Radford C, Guo X, Magor KE	Dev Comp Immunol	 2007;31(3):272-85	 doi: 101016/jdci200606005 Epub 2006 Aug 2	To search for immune relevant genes of the duck we have conducted an expressed sequence tag (EST) project. Duck immune genes are relevant to disease resistance in agriculture and in intervention in avian influenza outbreaks through vaccination of ducks. We sequenced 3168 clones from a spleen cDNA library of a White Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos. We constructed an EST analysis pipeline enabling (1) quality checking and clustering, (2) identification based on BLAST results, (3) annotation using Gene Ontology, and (4) submission to the dbEST database. In total, 208 genes were relevant to the duck immune system, which we have divided into categories: (1) leukocyte receptors, (2) lectin-like immunoreceptors, (3) cytokines and chemokines, (4) transcription factors (5) mediators of antigen processing or apoptosis, and (6) innate effectors. We compared 425 homologous sequences between the duck and the closest genetic model organism, chicken. Homologous genes had regions sharing 80 to 99 percent nucleotide identity, however immune-relevant genes were less conserved than other genes.
764	16903476	Effect of method of delivering nicarbazin to mallards on plasma 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide levels and reproduction.	Yoder CA, Graham JK, Miller LA, Bynum KS, Johnston JJ, Goodall MJ	Poult Sci	 2006 Aug;85(8):1442-8	 doi: 101093/ps/8581442	Nicarbazin (NCZ), a coccidiostat used in the poultry industry, has been developed as a contraceptive for resident Canada geese. We tested the efficacy of NCZ as a contraceptive using mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) as a model for Canada geese. Nicarbazin-treated corn was fed ad libitum for 14 d at 0, 750, 1,000, or 1,500 ppm. Plasma and egg levels of 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the active anticoccidial component of NCZ, differed among treatment groups in a dose-response relationship, but plasma levels did not differ between sexes. Nicarbazin caused a decrease in egg weight, but there was no effect of NCZ on the numbers of eggs laid per female per day. Nicarbazin did not significantly impact bird health. An additional trial tested the effect of the method of NCZ delivery on plasma DNC levels. Mallards were given NCZ daily for 12 d either by gavage with a corn oil suspension, gavage with a water suspension, peroral administration of a capsule, or feeding 500 mg of NCZ/kg of pelleted feed ad libitum. The method of delivery significantly affected plasma DNC levels, with the highest levels in the corn oil suspension group and the lowest levels in the pelleted feed group. This is likely due to decreased availability of NCZ in a pellet compared with gavage with a suspension or capsule. Mallards receiving 34.2 mg of NCZ/kg of BW when fed cracked corn coated with NCZ daily for 14 d had higher plasma DNC levels than those obtained by liquid gavage, capsule, or pelleted NCZ feed. For maximum effect in the field, NCZ should be coated onto corn. A higher concentration of NCZ is needed in pelleted feed to obtain comparable plasma DNC levels to allow for the decreased absorption of DNC.
765	16894718	Taxonomic, topical and quantitative structure of the community of intestinal flukes (Digenea) of mallards, Anas platyrhynchos Linnaeus, 1758 from the area of Szczecin	Betlejewska KM, Korol EN	Wiad Parazytol	 2002;48(4):343-57		Taxonomic, topical and quantitative structure of the community of intestinal flukes (Digenea) of mallards, Anas platyrhynchos Linnaeus, 1758 from the area of Szczecin. A total of 55 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos L.) from the area of Szczecin were examined for the presence of intestinal flukes (Digenea). This study covered the taxonomic structure (specific composition and taxonomic affiliation of the parasites), topical structure (parasites' distribution within the host's organism), and quantitative structure (infection intensity, abundance, prevalence, and infection index "Z"). Flukes were found in 69.1% of the birds studied. The highest intensity of infection and prevalence exhibited species of the family Echinostomatidae (Echinostoma revolutum, Echinostoma miyagawai, Echinostoma sp., Echinoparyphium recurvatum) and Notocotylus attenuatus of the family Notocotylidae. The mallards surveyed hosted 15 species of flukes, representing 6 families. Echinostoma miyagawai Ishii, 1932 has been found for the first time in Poland. The present findings of Psilotrema similium and Prosthogonimus ovatus in mallard constitute new host records for these parasites.
766	16854647	Unilateral seminoma with multiple visceral metastases in a duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Mutinelli F, Vascellari M, Bozzato E	Avian Pathol	 2006 Aug;35(4):327-9	 doi: 101080/03079450600821158	A case of unilateral seminoma with visceral metastases in a Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) is reported. The right testis was markedly enlarged. The liver surface showed multifocal to coalescent regular circular umbilicated greyish-white spots. In addition, multiple rough whitish nodules were evident on the pancreas and the visceral peritoneum lining the intestine. Histologically, the right testicular parenchyma was diffusely affected and replaced by neoplastic growth, consisting of sheets of large round to polyhedral cells with conspicuous vesicular nuclei having distinctly granular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Sheets of cells with similar features were observed also in the other affected organs. Multiple lung metastases were detected on histology. This is the first known report of seminoma with hepatic, pancreatic, pulmonary and peritoneal metastases in a Mallard duck.
767	16840252	Phosphorus amendment reduces hepatic and renal oxidative stress in mallards ingesting lead-contaminated sediments.	Hoffman DJ, Heinz GH, Audet DJ	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2006 Jun;69(11):1039-53	 doi: 101080/00397910500360210	Lead poisoning of waterfowl has been reported for decades in the Coeur d'Alene River Basin (CDARB) in Idaho as a result of the ingestion of lead-contaminated sediments. This study was conducted to determine whether the addition of phosphoric acid to CDARB sediments would reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of lead to the liver and kidney of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards received diets containing 12% clean sediment (controls) or 12% sediment from three different CDARB sites containing 4520, 5390, or 6990 microg/g lead (dry weight) with or without phosphoric acid amendment. Liver and kidney lead concentrations were significantly higher in all CDARB treatment groups and ranged from geometric mean values of 18.2 (liver) and 28.7 (kidney) for the first 2 sites to 22.5 (liver) and 45.6 (kidney) microg/g (wet weight) for the third site. With amendments all liver lead concentrations were reduced 36 to 55%, and all kidney lead concentrations were lowered 54 to 73%. Unamended CDARB sediment from the third site resulted in the following hepatic effects: over 1.6-fold elevation of liver glutathione (reduced form; GSH) concentration, higher GSH S-transferase and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) reductase activities, and lower protein-bound thiols (PBSH) concentration. Renal effects included higher kidney GSH concentrations for all CDARB sites, with over 2.1-fold higher for the third site. Resulting kidney GSSG to GSH ratios were lower at two sites. At the third site, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity was elevated, and lipid peroxidation as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was 1.7-fold greater. Amendment restored all hepatic variables as well as the renal variables TBARS and GGT so they did not differ from controls. Although amendments of phosphorus substantially reduced the bioavailability of lead and some of the adverse effects, lead concentrations in the tissues of mallards fed the amended sediments were still above those considered to be harmful to waterfowl under the present conditions.
768	16830869	Evaluation of nicarbazin as a potential waterfowl contraceptive using mallards as a model.	Yoder CA, Graham JK, Miller LA, Bynum KS, Johnston JJ, Goodall MJ	Poult Sci	 2006 Jul;85(7):1275-84	 doi: 101093/ps/8571275	Contraception may provide a useful nonlethal management tool to reduce wild bird populations. We tested the efficacy of nicarbazin (NCZ) as a contraceptive for waterfowl and assessed health effects of NCZ, using domestic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) as a model for Canada geese (Branta canadensis). Mallards were given gelatin capsules containing 0, 8.5, 17.0, or 33.75 mg of NCZ/kg of BW perorally once daily for 14 d. Fecal 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) and fluorescein were evaluated as potential markers of plasma and egg DNC levels. Plasma, egg, and fecal DNC levels differed among treatment groups in a dose response relationship. There were no significant effects on the numbers of eggs laid per female per day, proportion of fertile eggs, proportion of eggs hatching, or egg yolk mottling. Hatchability was 0.55 +/- 0.1 in the control group compared with 0.26 +/- 0.1 in the 33.75 mg/kg of BW group. Degeneration of the vitelline membrane was evident at all treatment levels; severity was dose-related and greater in the outer vitelline membrane than the inner vitelline membrane. No significant health effects were observed for birds treated with NCZ. The heterophil:lymphocyte ratio was elevated during the treatment and posttreatment periods in all groups, indicating birds were experiencing stress due to handling. Fecal DNC levels did not correlate well with plasma DNC levels, likely due to NCZ being administered as a bolus dose rather than being fed ad libitum. Fluorescein correlated well with plasma DNC levels during the treatment period and can therefore be used successfully as a noninvasive marker to determine the approximate amount of NCZ a bird is consuming. As a contraceptive, NCZ likely would have minimal adverse health effects on the target animal, although field studies with the species of interest need to be conducted. Further research using higher NCZ levels needs to be conducted to determine whether NCZ can inhibit reproduction in waterfowl.
769	16826754	The 2003 results of monitoring of influenza A virus in the populations of wild birds in the south of Western Siberia	Razumova IuV, Shchelkanov MIu, Zolotykh SI, Durymanova AA, Ternovoi VA, Beklemishev AB, Slavskii AA, Iurlov AK, Shestopalov AM, L'vov DK, Netesov SV	Vopr Virusol	 2006 May-Jun;51(3):32-7		The paper presents the results of isolation of influenza A virus from 97 cloacal swabs of 11 species of aquatic and semiaquatic wild birds collected on the Chany Lake (the south of Western Siberia, Ob-Irtysh interarea). Six strains with subtypes H2 (2 strains), H3 (3 strains), and H5 (1 strain) were isolated from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The total infection rate in the examined birds was 6.2% and that in the ducks was 9.7%. The paper deals with the phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin of genes of isolates and with the comparison of the obtained results with the 2002 data in the same region. Analysis of H5 strain hemagglutinin proteolytic site permits one to regard this strain as non-pathogenic.
770	16822269	Expression of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in the primary lymphoid organs of the duck Anas platyrhynchos.	Squillacioti C, Mirabella N, De Luca A, Paino G	J Anat	 2006 Jul;209(1):51-8	 doi: 101111/j1469-7580200600592x	The expression of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) was studied in the thymus and bursa of Fabricius of the duck Anas platyrhynchos, at different ages, using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, RT-PCR and sequencing. In the thymus, PACAP immunoreactivity (-ir) was found in lymphoid cells. CD68/ and PGP 9.5/PACAP38 double labelling showed that PACAP was not expressed either in macrophages or in epithelial cells, suggesting that the PACAP-positive cells observed were lymphoid cells. Immunoreactive lymphocytes were observed in the interlobular septa. They increased in number with ageing. In the bursa, PACAP-ir was found in nerve fibres and in a few lymphoid cells. RT-PCR revealed PACAP mRNA expression in the thymus but not in the bursa. These results suggest that PACAP plays a role in the functions of the immune system in birds.
771	16815603	High prevalence of influenza A virus in ducks caught during spring migration through Sweden.	Wallensten A, Munster VJ, Karlsson M, Lundkvist A, Brytting M, Stervander M, Osterhaus AD, Fouchier RA, Olsen B	Vaccine	 2006 Nov 10;24(44-46):6734-5	 doi: 101016/jvaccine200605057 Epub 2006 Jun 6	As part of our ongoing screening of wild birds in Northern Europe, 358 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 203 shelducks (Tadorna tadorna) were caught in southern Sweden during the spring 2003. Faecal samples were analyzed by real time RT-PCR for the presence of influenza A virus. In contrast to what has been found in North American studies; Eurasian spring migrating ducks passing through Sweden had a relatively high prevalence of influenza A virus.
772	16806495	Expression of different classes of immunoglobulin in intraepithelial plasma cells of the Harderian gland of domestic ducks Anas platyrhynchos.	Oliveira CA, Telles LF, Oliveira AG, Kalapothakis E, Goncalves-Dornelas H, Mahecha GA	Vet Immunol Immunopathol	 2006 Oct 15;113(3-4):257-66	 doi: 101016/jvetimm200605008 Epub 2006 Jun 27	The Harderian gland of chickens contains numerous plasma cells and is considered as a peripheral lymphoid organ. Data about this gland in other avian species are scarce or inexistent. Considering that ducks show some unique characteristics regarding the immune system, which are important in evolutionary context, and that unusual location of plasma cells into the epithelium was recently described in primitive avian species, here we investigated the occurrence and characterized intraepithelial plasma cells in the Harderian gland of ducks, according to the immunoglobulin produced. Numerous intraepithelial plasma cells were found confined to the Harderian gland ducts. Plasma cells were also found in the ducts lamina propria. IgM-positive cells were the most abundant into the epithelium. In contrast, IgY- or IgA-positive cells were predominant in the lamina propria. The constancy of intraepithelial plasma cells in all specimens examined indicates that they may be essential mediator for an effective immunesurvaillance of the ocular mucosa.
773	16787862	Comparative study of the photopic spectral sensitivity of domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo) and humans.	Barber CL, Prescott NB, Jarvis JR, Le Sueur C, Perry GC, Wathes CM	Br Poult Sci	 2006 Jun;47(3):365-74	 doi: 101080/00071660600753870	1. The photopic spectral sensitivity of domestic ducks and turkeys was determined using an operant psychophysical technique. Spectral sensitivity was determined over a range of specified wavelengths, including UVA, between 326 < lambda < 694 nm and the results were directly compared with human spectral sensitivity measured under similar experimental conditions. 2. Domestic ducks and turkeys had similar spectral sensitivities to each other, and could perceive UVA radiation, although turkeys were more sensitive to UVA than ducks. For both species, peak sensitivity was between 544 < lambda < 577 nm, with reduced sensitivity at lambda = 508 and 600 nm. Both ducks and turkeys had a very different and broader range of spectral sensitivity than the human subjects tested. 3. Spectral sensitivity and UVA perception in these avian species are discussed in relation to their visual ecology and the mechanisms controlling neural processing of colour information.

The study has used a porcine embryonic renal cell line and the highly pathogenic A/Duck/Novosibirsk/56/05 (H5N1) strain from a sick domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) (Chany Lake environs, Novosibirsk Region).
775	16736185	Experimental evidence for density-dependent survival in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings.	Gunnarsson G, Elmberg J, Sjoberg K, Poysa H, Nummi P	Oecologia	 2006 Aug;149(2):203-13	 doi: 101007/s00442-006-0446-8 Epub 2006 May 31	It is unresolved to what extent waterfowl populations are regulated by density-dependent processes. By doing a 2-year crossover perturbation experiment on ten oligotrophic boreal lakes we addressed the hypothesis that breeding output is density dependent. Wing-clipped mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) hens were introduced with their own brood and then monitored for 24 days. Predicted responses were that per capita duckling and hen survival would be lower in high-density than in low-density treatments. Survival was evaluated by model fitting in program MARK. Density, year, and lake were used as main effects, while day after introduction, a weather harshness index, and presence of hens were covariates. Daily survival in ducklings was lower in the high-density treatment, but this effect was year dependent. The highest-ranking model for duckling survival also included a positive effect of duckling age and presence of hens, and a negative effect of harsh weather. Density did not affect female survival although there was a prominent year effect. The highest-ranking model for female survival also included negative effects of day after introduction and harsh weather. This is the first study to report density-dependent survival in experimentally introduced ducklings in a natural setting. Implications for population dynamics and management of harvested populations are far-reaching if such regulation occurs in some years, but not in others.
776	16718591	Catatropis hatcheri n. sp. (Digenea: Notocotylidae) from Heleobia hatcheri (Prosobranchia: Hydrobiidae) and notes on its life-cycle in Patagonia, Argentina.	Flores V, Brugni N	Syst Parasitol	 2006 Feb;63(2):111-18	 doi: 101007/s11230-005-9004-8 Epub 2006 Apr 27	A new species of Catatropis Oghner, 1905 from a freshwater Neotropical prosobranch snail, Heleobia hatcheri (Hydrobiidae), is described. Naturally infected snails were collected from Nahuel Huapi Lake in Andean Patagonia. The characteristics of the larval stages are also presented. Experimental adults were recovered from the distal region of the intestinal caeca of chicks and ducklings and natural adults from a wild duck Anas platyrhynchos. Adults of Catatropis hatcheri n. sp. can be distinguished from all other species of the genus in having 10-12 (11) ventral glands in each lateral row, the cirrus-sac extending back to between the first third and the middle of the body, the metraterm shorter than the cirrus-sac, a previtelline field of 1,258-1,544 (1,396), vitelline follicles reach back to the anterior border of the testes with some follicles extending slightly lateral to them, only external testicular margin lobed and genital pore in median line just posterior to the intestinal bifurcation. In addition, the eggs have one filament on each pole, the rediae contain one or two mature cercariae, and the cercariae are tri-oculate, with a long tail and encyst in the environment.
777	16649371	Determination of definitive and intermediate hosts of cercarial dermatitis-producing agents in northern Iran.	Athari A, Gohar-Dehi S, Rostami-Jalilian M	Arch Iran Med	 2006 Jan;9(1):11-5		BACKGROUND: The study concerns the prevalence of avian schistosomes in intermediate and definite hosts in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. METHODS: A total of 14190 fresh-water snails belonging to various genera were sampled and tested for cercarial emission by lighting and then crushing. During the same period, the nasal blood vessels and mesenteric veins of aquatic birds, mainly belonging to the Anatidae family, were examined under dissecting microscope for detecting adult worms. RESULTS: Forty-seven (0.33%) of examined snails mainly Lymnaea gedrosiana, L.palustris, L.stagnalis, and Planorbis planorbis were found to be infected with larval stages of Trichobilharzia spp. Adult schistosomes were observed in 25 (18.1%) wild waterfowls. The most infected birds were Anas platyrhynchos, A.clypeata, and Aythya ferina, respectively. CONCLUSION: Annually migration of various species of aquatic birds toward the northern parts of Iran and the simultaneous presence of intermediate snails in the water resources of this area, combined with long hours of sunshine in the summer months, suggest that cercarial dermatitis could be a prominent health problem, especially among paddy field workers in this area.
778	16537157	Coronaviruses in poultry and other birds.	Cavanagh D	Avian Pathol	 2005 Dec;34(6):439-48	 doi: 101080/03079450500367682	The number of avian species in which coronaviruses have been detected has doubled in the past couple of years. While the coronaviruses in these species have all been in coronavirus Group 3, as for the better known coronaviruses of the domestic fowl (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV], in Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), there is experimental evidence to suggest that birds are not limited to infection with Group 3 coronaviruses. In China coronaviruses have been isolated from peafowl (Pavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris; also isolated in Brazil), partridge (Alectoris) and also from a non-gallinaceous bird, the teal (Anas), all of which were being reared in the vicinity of domestic fowl. These viruses were closely related in genome organization and in gene sequences to IBV. Indeed, gene sequencing and experimental infection of chickens indicated that the peafowl isolate was the H120 IB vaccine strain, while the teal isolate was possibly a field strain of a nephropathogenic IBV. Thus the host range of IBV does extend beyond the chicken. Most recently, Group 3 coronaviruses have been detected in greylag goose (Anser anser), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and pigeon (Columbia livia). It is clear from the partial genome sequencing of these viruses that they are not IBV, as they have two additional small genes near the 3' end of the genome. Twenty years ago a coronavirus was isolated after inoculation of mice with tissue from the coastal shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). While it is not certain whether the virus was actually from the shearwater or from the mice, recent experiments have shown that bovine coronavirus (a Group 2 coronavirus) can infect and also cause enteric disease in turkeys. Experiments with some Group 1 coronaviruses (all from mammals, to date) have shown that they are not limited to replicating or causing disease in a single host. SARS-coronavirus has a wide host range. Clearly there is the potential for the emergence of new coronavirus diseases in domestic birds, from both avian and mammalian sources. Modest sequence conservation within gene 1 has enabled the design of oligonucleotide primers for use in diagnostic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, which will be useful for the detection of new coronaviruses.
779	16510785	A genetic and cytogenetic map for the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Huang Y, Zhao Y, Haley CS, Hu S, Hao J, Wu C, Li N	Genetics	 2006 May;173(1):287-96	 doi: 101534/genetics105053256 Epub 2006 Mar 1	A genetic linkage map for the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was developed within a cross between two extreme Peking duck lines by linkage analysis of 155 polymorphic microsatellite markers, including 84 novel markers reported in this study. A total of 115 microsatellite markers were placed into 19 linkage groups. The sex-averaged map spans 1353.3 cM, with an average interval distance of 15.04 cM. The male map covers 1415 cM, whereas the female map covers only 1387.6 cM. All of the flanking sequences of the 155 polymorphic loci--44 monomorphic loci and a further 41 reported microsatellite loci for duck--were blasted against the chicken genomic sequence, and corresponding orthologs were found for 49. To integrate the genetic and cytogenetic map of the duck genome, 28 BAC clones were screened from a chicken BAC library using the specific PCR primers and localized to duck chromosomes by FISH, respectively. Of 28 BAC clones, 24 were detected definitely on duck chromosomes. Thus, 11 of 19 linkage groups were localized to 10 duck chromosomes. This genetic and cytogenetic map will be helpful for the mapping QTL in duck for breeding applications and for conducting genomic comparisons between chicken and duck.
780	19754829	Carboplatin for treatment of a Sertoli cell tumor in a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Childs-Sanford SE, Rassnick KM, Alcaraz A	Vet Comp Oncol	 2006 Mar;4(1):51-6	 doi: 101111/j1476-5810200600087x	A 13-year-old male mallard was diagnosed with a non-resectable Sertoli cell tumor involving the left testis. The duck was treated with four doses of single-agent carboplatin given at 4- to 5-week intervals. Heteropenia, 2 weeks after each treatment, was the acute dose-limiting toxicity. The tumor reduced in size by 25%, and the duck's clinical condition improved for 12 months. Sertoli cell tumors are rare in birds, and this is the first report, to our knowledge, of attempted chemotherapy treatment in the veterinary literature.
781	16480768	Evolution of antibody class switching: identification and transcriptional control of an Inu exon in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lundqvist ML, McElveen BR, Middleton DL, Chapman R, Warr GW	Dev Comp Immunol	 2006;30(6):575-87	 doi: 101016/jdci200505004 Epub 2005 Jun 20	Immunoglobulin class switching is characteristic to the tetrapod lineage, but the nature of this process has been elucidated only in mammals, where I-exon transcription initiates and directs the recombination in the IgH locus. Here, it is shown that an I-exon occurs 5' of the nu (IgY constant region) gene of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos): it is longer than mammalian I-exons and comprised primarily of tandem repeats. The Inu promoter was identified and shown to be responsive to stimulation with IL-4 but not LPS. It contains Oct, LYF-1, ATF, and C/EBP motifs. Site directed mutagenesis indicates that 2 C/EBP motifs are uniquely necessary for the response of the promoter to IL-4, as tested in the mouse pre-B cell line, 70Z/3. These results support the conclusion that the signal transduction pathways controlling I-exon promoter responses to cytokines have been highly conserved in vertebrate evolution.
782	16455845	Risk assessment test for lead bioaccessibility to waterfowl in mine-impacted soils.	Furman O, Strawn DG, Heinz GH, Williams B	J Environ Qual	 2006 Feb 2;35(2):450-8	 doi: 102134/jeq20050316 Print 2006 Mar-Apr	Due to variations in soil physicochemical properties, species physiology, and contaminant speciation, Pb toxicity is difficult to evaluate without conducting in vivo dose-response studies. Such tests, however, are expensive and time consuming, making them impractical to use in assessment and management of contaminated environments. One possible alternative is to develop a physiologically based extraction test (PBET) that can be used to measure relative bioaccessibility. We developed and correlated a PBET designed to measure the bioaccessibility of Pb to waterfowl (W-PBET) in mine-impacted soils located in the Coeur d'Alene River Basin, Idaho. The W-PBET was also used to evaluate the impact of P amendments on Pb bioavailability. The W-PBET results were correlated to waterfowl-tissue Pb levels from a mallard duck [Anas platyrhynchos (L.)] feeding study. The W-PBET Pb concentrations were significantly less in the P-amended soils than in the unamended soils. Results from this study show that the W-PBET can be used to assess relative changes in Pb bioaccessibility to waterfowl in these mine-impacted soils, and therefore will be a valuable test to help manage and remediate contaminated soils.
783	16446990	Phosphorus amendment reduces hematological effects of lead in mallards ingesting contaminated sediments.	Hoffman DJ, Heinz GH, Audet DJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2006 Apr;50(3):421-8	 doi: 101007/s00244-005-5009-1 Epub 2006 Jan 30	Lead poisoning of waterfowl has been reported for decades in the Coeur d'Alene River Basin (CDARB) in Idaho as a result of the ingestion of lead-contaminated sediments. This study was conducted to determine whether the addition of phosphoric acid to sediments would reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of lead to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) as related to adverse hematological effects and altered plasma chemistries. Mallards received diets containing 12% clean sediment (controls) or 12% sediment from three different CDARB sites containing 4520, 5390, or 6990 microg/g lead (dw) with or without phosphoric acid amendment. Blood lead concentrations were significantly higher in all CDARB treatment groups and ranged from geometric mean values of 5.0 microg/g for the first two sites to 6.2 microg/g for the third site. With amendments, all blood lead concentrations became 41% to 64% lower. Red blood cell ALAD activity was depressed by 90% or more with lead-contaminated sediment from all sites and did not differ with amended diets. Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) concentrations were elevated by contaminated sediment from all sites. Amendment decreased the elevations in FEP by as much as 80%. Hematocrit values and hemoglobin concentrations were lower for all lead site sediments by as much as 30% for site 3. Plasma enzyme activities for ALT, CK, and LDH-L were elevated by as much as 2.2-fold, and plasma creatinine concentration was 1.7-fold higher for site 3 sediment. Amendments restored hematocrit, hemoglobin, and plasma enzyme activities so that they did not differ from controls. Although amendments of phosphorus substantially reduced the bioavailability of lead and alleviated many of the adverse hematological effects, lead concentrations in the blood of mallards fed the amended sediments were still above those believed to be harmful to waterfowl under the present conditions.
784	16425630	Avian influenza A viruses in birds --an ecological, ornithological and virological view.	Kaleta EF, Hergarten G, Yilmaz A	Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr	 2005 Dec;112(12):448-56		Avian influenza A viruses (AIV) are the causative agents of the presently most important poultry disease. Ten countries in Asia and several other countries in Eastern Europe suffer high losses from the lethal effects of these viruses of the H5N1 subtype. AIV of other subtypes cause in additional countries severe losses. The threat to health and well-being of the avifauna, domestic poultry and possibly mammals including humans are worldwide of major concern. The European Union reacted with a complete import ban on untreated meat, eggs, poultry products as well as free-living and pet birds. Extensive surveillance of free-living birds and domestic poultry that is maintained in free-range and close to open waters were initiated in an attempt to gather information on the current status of infection with these viruses and to target appropriate countermeasures for the protection of domestic poultry (in-house keeping) and to safeguard food production for humans. Since the monitoring of free-living birds is labour-intensive, costly, and time-consuming, only birds should be included in the monitoring programme that harboured in the past most if not all influenza A viruses. The birds of the order Anatiformes, family Anatidae, subfamilies Anserinae and Anatinae, provided 65.9 % of all avian AIV isolates. The cosmopolitan Common Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the dominant species with the highest rate of isolations among all bird species. Second in frequency is the North-American Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors). Consequently, free-living anatiform birds of the genera Anas and Spatula should comprise the main focus for the collection of cloacal and pharyngeal swabs. With the likely exception of the most recent H5N1 viruses, signs of disease were not recorded in AIV infected anatiform birds. AIV isolations were definitely less frequently obtained from birds of the orders Phasianiformes (including domestic chickens and turkeys), Charadriiformes (plovers and lapwings), Lariformes (gulls), Columbiformes (pigeons) and Psittaciformes (psittacines) and need less attention in sampling efforts. This review presents also data on taxonomy and most suitable means for isolation and typing of haemagglutinating viruses. The different frequencies of the detection of 16 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 subtypes of neuraminidase (NA) surface antigens are composed on the basis of extensive literature retrievals. Both antigens occure in isolates at different frequencies. Only 103 of all 144 possible HA x NA combinations were described so far. The AIV that contain the HA subtypes H3, H4, H6 are most frequently isolated whereas the AIV of the subtypes H5 and H7 were less frequently encountered. All other HAs are rather rare. AIV that possess the NA of the subtypes N2, N1, N8 and N3 are frequent and all other NAs are rarely detected.
785	16407091	Toxicity and hazard of vanadium to mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis).	Rattner BA, McKernan MA, Eisenreich KM, Link WA, Olsen GH, Hoffman DJ, Knowles KA, McGowan PC	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2006 Feb;69(3-4):331-51	 doi: 101080/15287390500398265	A recent Canada goose (Branta canadensis) die-off at a petroleum refinery fly ash pond in Delaware was attributed to vanadium (V) toxicity. Because of the paucity of V toxicity data for wild birds, a series of studies was undertaken using the forms of V believed to have resulted in this incident. In 7-d single oral dose trials with mallard drakes (Anas platyrhynchos), the estimated median lethal dose (LD50) for vanadium pentoxide was 113 mg/kg body weight, while the LD50 for sodium metavanadate was 75.5 mg/kg. Sodium metavanadate was found to be even more potent (LD50 = 37.2 mg/kg) in male Canada geese. The most distinctive histopathological lesion of both forms of V was lympho-granulocytic enteritis with hemorrhage into the intestinal lumen. Vanadium accumulation in liver and kidney was proportional to the administered dose, and predictive analyses based on these data suggest that V concentrations of 10 microg/g dry weight (dw) in liver and 25 microg/g dw in kidney are associated with mortality (>90% confidence that exposure is >LD50) in mallards acutely exposed to sodium metavanadate. Chronic exposure to increasing dietary concentrations of sodium metavanadate (38.5 to 2651 ppm) over 67 d resulted in V accumulation in liver and kidney (25.2 and 13.6 microg/g dw, respectively), mild intestinal hemorrhage, blood chemistry changes, and evidence of hepatic oxidative stress in mallards, although some of these responses may have been confounded by food avoidance and weight loss. Dietary exposure of mallards to 250 ppm sodium metavanadate for 4 wk resulted in modest accumulation of V in liver and kidney (<5 microg/g dw) and mild intestinal hemorrhage. Based on these data and other observations, it is unlikely that chronic low-level dietary exposure to V poses a direct lethal hazard to wildlife. However, point sources, such as the V-laden fly ash pond encountered by geese at the petroleum refinery in Delaware, may pose a significant hazard to water birds.
786	16398331	Screening of feral pigeon (Colomba livia), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and graylag goose (Anser anser) populations for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., avian influenza virus and avian paramyxovirus.	Lillehaug A, Monceyron Jonassen C, Bergsjo B, Hofshagen M, Tharaldsen J, Nesse LL, Handeland K	Acta Vet Scand	 2005;46(4):193-202	 doi: 101186/1751-0147-46-193	A total of 119 fresh faecal samples were collected from graylag geese migrating northwards in April. Also, cloacal swabs were taken from 100 carcasses of graylag geese shot during the hunting season in August. In addition, samples were taken from 200 feral pigeons and five mallards. The cultivation of bacteria detected Campylobacter jejuni jejuni in six of the pigeons, and in one of the mallards. Salmonella diarizona 14: k: z53 was detected in one graylag goose, while all pigeons and mallards were negative for salmonellae. No avian paramyxovirus was found in any of the samples tested. One mallard, from an Oslo river, was influenza A virus positive, confirmed by RT-PCR and by inoculation of embryonated eggs. The isolate termed A/Duck/Norway/ 1/03 was found to be of H3N8 type based on sequence analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase segments, and serological tests. This is the first time an avian influenza virus has been isolated in Norway. The study demonstrates that the wild bird species examined may constitute a reservoir for important bird pathogens and zoonotic agents in Norway.
787	16392015	Pharmacokinetics and acute lethality of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) to juvenile mallard and northern bobwhite.	Newsted JL, Beach SA, Gallagher SP, Giesy JP	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2006 Apr;50(3):411-20	 doi: 101007/s00244-005-1137-x Epub 2006 Jan 2	Ten-day-old mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) were fed perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) in their diet for 5 days. The birds were then observed for 3 days while being given uncontaminated feed, and half of the birds were sacrificed on Day 8 of the trial. The remaining birds were maintained for an additional two weeks prior to being euthanized on Day 22 of the trial. Birds were assessed for growth, rate of feed consumption, behavior, physical injury, mortality, and gross abnormalities. Liver weight and concentrations of PFOS in blood serum and liver were also assessed. Based on the average daily intake (ADI) of PFOS calculated over the 5-day exposure period, the LD50 for juvenile mallards was determined to be 150 mg PFOS/kg body weight (bw)/day, equivalent to a total cumulative dose of 750 mg PFOS/kg bw calculated over a 5-day period. For juvenile quail, the LD50 based on the ADI was 61 mg PFOS/kg bw/day, equivalent to a total cumulative dose of 305 mg PFOS/kg bw. Reductions in weight gain and body weight were observed in quail from the 141 mg PFOS/kg treatment, but these measures returned to control levels by Day 22. The no-mortality dietary treatments were 70.3 and 141 mg PFOS/kg feed for quail and mallards, respectively. Both mallards and quail accumulated PFOS in blood serum and liver in a dose-dependent manner. The half-lives of PFOS in mallard blood serum and liver were estimated to be 6.86 and 17.5 days, respectively. In quail, the half-life of PFOS in liver was estimated to be 12.8 days, while the half-life of PFOS in quail blood serum could not be estimated. Concentrations of PFOS in juvenile mallard and quail liver associated with mortality are at least 50-fold greater than the single maximum PFOS concentration that has been measured in livers of avian wildlife.
788	16359109	Selection responses in duration of fertility and its consequences on hatchability in the intergeneric crossbreeding of ducks.	Cheng YS, Rouvier R, Poivey JP, Huang HC, Liu HL, Tai C	Br Poult Sci	 2005 Oct;46(5):565-71	 doi: 101080/00071660500273193	1. From 1992 to 2003, selected (S) and control lines (C) of the laying Brown Tsaiya duck (Anas platyrhynchos) were simultaneously maintained under the same standardised conditions of feeding and management. 2. The selection objective was to increase the number of fertile eggs after a single artificial insemination (AI) with pooled Muscovy semen. From generations G1 to G11, 2452 and 2022 female ducks, in S and C lines, respectively, were measured and recorded. In the S line, the percentage selected varied between 20.2 and 34.3% in females and between 7.2 and 20.8% in males. 3. Selection for number of fertile eggs had a correlated effect of increasing the parameter tau of the logistic curves which fitted the daily variations (d 2 to 15) in fertility or hatchability on the basis of eggs set. The differences S-C for the estimates of the times of half maximal fertility and hatchability increased by 0.41 and 0.37 d per generation between G1 and G11, respectively. 4. The highest increases of fertility per day rates after a single AI were observed between d 5 and 11. Moreover, in the selected line, fertility rate was higher than, or equal to, 90% in d 2 from G8. The same tendencies were observed for the changes in the evolution of hatchability on the basis of eggs set. 5. Selection increased fertility and hatchability according to the egg set rates, especially for d 2 to 8 after AI. Hatchability of fertile eggs was not impaired, confirming that selection for one AI per week was possible in this strain of laying ducks.
789	16351835	Coping with excess salt: adaptive functions of extrarenal osmoregulatory organs in vertebrates.	Hildebrandt JP	Zoology (Jena)	 2001;104(3-4):209-20	 doi: 101078/0944-2006-00026	In all organisms, changing environmental conditions require appropriate regulatory measures to physiologically adjust to the altered situation. Uptake of excess salt in non-mammalian vertebrates having limited or no access to freshwater is balanced by extrarenal salt excretion through specialized structures called 'salt glands'. Nasal salt glands of marine birds are usually fully developed in very early stages of their lives since individuals of these species are exposed to salt soon after hatching. In individuals of other bird species, salt uptake may occur infrequently. In these animals, glands are usually quiescent and glandular cells are kept in a fairly undifferentiated state. This is the situation in 'naive' ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos, which have never been exposed to excess salt. When these animals become initially osmotically stressed, the nasal glands start to secrete a moderately hypertonic sodium chloride solution but secretory performance is meager. Within 48 h after the initial stimulus, however, the number of cells per gland is elevated by a factor of 2-3, the secretory cells differentiate and acquire full secretory capacity. During this differentiation process, extensive surface specializations are formed. The number of mitochondria is increased and metabolic enzymes and transporters are upregulated. These adaptive growth and differentiation processes result in a much higher efficiency of salt excretion in acclimated ducklings compared with naive animals. Receptors and signal transduction pathways in salt gland cells controling the adaptive processes seem to be the same as those controling salt secretion, namely muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide. This review focusses on signal transduction pathways activated by muscarinic receptors which seem to fine-tune salt secretion in salt-adapted ducklings and may control adaptive growth and differentiation processes in the nasal gland of naive animals.
790	16313299	Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and other avian interleukin-2 reveals significant conservation of gene organization, promoter elements and functional residues.	Sreekumar E, Premraj A, Rasool TJ	Int J Immunogenet	 2005 Dec;32(6):355-65	 doi: 101111/j1744-313X200500538x	We compared the gene, promoter and cDNA sequences, and the predicted protein structure of duck and quail interleukin-2 (IL-2), a major immunomodulatory cytokine, with the known sequences of other avian and human IL-2. Analysis of the gene organization showed significant similarity with the overall organization of mammalian IL-2 genes, with four exons and three introns and a very short 5' untranslated regions. The second intron was the biggest in all the IL-2 sequences. The third intron was of similar size in chicken and quail, whereas in duck it was found to be slightly longer. Promoter sequence analysis of the IL-2 gene revealed remarkable conservation of the functionally important residues. The transcription factor binding sites such as those for AP-1, NF-AT, CD 28 RE and OCT, the TATA box and the predicted transcription start site with respect to chicken IL-2 sequence showed total conservation in duck, quail and turkey IL-2 promoters. Comparative analysis of the avian IL-2 cDNAs such as those of chicken, turkey, duck, quail, goose and Muscovy duck, revealed significant conservation of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences. They showed nucleotide identity levels varying from 75% to 85%, amino acid level identity from 58% to 72% and amino acid similarity from 71% to 80% with each other. In the predicted protein secondary structure, the four essential alpha-helices and the hydrophobic amino acids in the heptad repeats forming the core structure of IL-2 molecules were conserved in all the avian and the human IL-2. The present study reveals high-level conservation of the gene; cDNA structure and regulatory elements of avian IL-2. This indicates highly conserved functions and probable functional cross-reactivity of this major immunomodulatory cytokine among birds.
791	16307214	Factors affecting the toxicity of methylmercury injected into eggs.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Kondrad SL, Erwin CA	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2006 Feb;50(2):264-79	 doi: 101007/s00244-005-1002-y Epub 2005 Nov 21	We developed a standardized protocol for comparing the sensitivities of the embryos of different bird species to methylmercury when methylmercury was injected into their eggs. During the course of developing this protocol, we investigated the effects of various factors on the toxicity of the injected methylmercury. Most of our experiments were done with chicken (Gallus domesticus), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) eggs, all of which were purchased in large numbers from game farms. A smaller amount of work was done with double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) eggs collected from the wild. Several solvents were tested, and corn oil at a rate of 1 microl/g egg contents was selected for the final standardized protocol because it had minimal toxicity to embryos and because methylmercury dissolved in corn oil yielded a dose-response curve in a range of egg concentrations that was similar to the range that causes reproductive impairment when the mother deposits methylmercury into her own eggs. The embryonic stage at which eggs were injected with corn oil altered mercury toxicity; at early stages, the corn oil itself was toxic. Therefore, in the final protocol we standardized the time of injection to occur when each species reached the morphologic equivalent of a 3-day-old chicken embryo. Although solvents can be injected directly into the albumen of an egg, high embryo mortality can occur in the solvent controls because of the formation of air bubbles in the albumen. Our final protocol used corn oil injections into the air cell, which are easier and safer than albumen injections. Most of the methylmercury, when dissolved in corn oil, injected into the air cell passes through the inner shell membrane and into the egg albumen. Most commercial incubators incubate eggs in trays with the air cell end of the egg pointing upward, but we discovered that mercury-induced mortality was too great when eggs were held in this orientation. In addition, some species of bird eggs require incubation on their sides with the eggs being rolled 180 degrees for them to develop normally. Therefore, we adopted a procedure of incubating the eggs of all species on their sides and rolling them 180 degrees every hour. Little has been published about the conditions of temperature, humidity, and the movements to which eggs of wild birds need to be subjected for them to hatch optimally under artificial incubation. Not unexpectedly, hatching success in an artificial incubator is generally less than what natural incubation by the parents can achieve. However, the survival of control embryos of most wild bird species was good (generally > or = 80%) up to within 1 or 2 days of hatching when we incubated the eggs at 37.5 degrees C (or 37.6 degrees C for gallinaceous species) at a relative humidity that resulted in an approximate 15% to 16% loss in egg weight by the end of incubation and by incubating the eggs on their sides and rolling them 180 degrees /h. To improve statistical comparisons, we used survival through 90% of incubation as our measurement to compare survival of controls with survival of eggs injected with graded concentrations of mercury.
792	16292650	ANG II-induced attenuation of duck salt gland secretion does not depend upon the release of adrenal catecholamines.	Butler DG, Lam W, Tong J	J Comp Physiol B	 2006 Jan;176(1):35-43	 doi: 101007/s00360-005-0029-8 Epub 2005 Nov 16	Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were bilaterally adrenalectomized (ADX) using a two-stage procedure and given daily i.m. injections of 1 mg kg bw(-1) of dexamethasone (DEXA), a steroid lacking mineralocorticoid activity, and 0.9% saline drinking water ad libitum to counterbalance renal losses of salt and water. Mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg) fell from 161+/- 3.7 (intact controls) to 116 +/- 6.9 (bilateral ADX+DEXA), a decrease of 27%, but heart rates (HR) were unchanged. The nasal salt glands were fully active after ADX + DEXA. Rates of fluid secretion and electrolyte and osmolal concentrations were unchanged. Secretion stopped, then rebounded several minutes later if ADX + DEXA ducks were injected i.v. with 1 microg of [Asn(1),Val(5)]-angiotensin II (ANG II) kg bw(-1) which showed that attenuation was not adrenal catecholamine-dependent.
793	16290188	Organic pollutants in wild ducks from New York state: I. Interspecies differences in concentrations and congener profiles of PCBs and PCDDs/PCDFs.	O'Keefe PW, Clayton WC, Connor S, Bush B, Hong CS	Sci Total Environ	 2006 May 15;361(1-3):111-23	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv200509072 Epub 2005 Nov 14	Wild ducks of three species, common mergansers (Mergus merganser americanus), gadwalls (Anas streptera), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), were collected near industrial sites in the Massena, NY area of the St. Lawrence River (SLR) in 1988/89 and 1994. Additional samples were collected in 1994 near a former polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) capacitor plant at Fort Edward, NY (a mallard and two wood ducks (Aix sponsa)), and at control sites (common mergansers, mallards and wood ducks). On a lipid basis, PCB concentrations in liver tissue from the 1994 collection ranged from 0.1 mug/g in a control wood duck to 676 mug/g in a common merganser from the SLR area. However, the highest total polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) concentrations were found in liver and fat tissues of gadwalls and mallards collected near the SLR industrial sites (2.8-12 ng/g lipid). These two species bioaccumulated non-2,3,7,8-substituted PCDFs in addition to 2,3,7,8-PCDF isomers, whereas common mergansers preferentially bioaccumulated 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDFs. The mergansers from the SLR sites were the only specimens contaminated with polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), which were all 2,3,7,8-substituted. The PCB and PCDF congener patterns in the duck tissues appear to have been influenced by both sampling location and species trophic level.
794	16272326	The MHC of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) contains five differentially expressed class I genes.	Moon DA, Veniamin SM, Parks-Dely JA, Magor KE	J Immunol	 2005 Nov 15;175(10):6702-12	 doi: 104049/jimmunol175106702	MHC class I proteins mediate a variety of functions in antiviral defense. In humans and mice, three MHC class I loci each contribute one or two alleles and each can present a wide variety of peptide Ags. In contrast, many lower vertebrates appear to use a single MHC class I locus. Previously we showed that a single locus was predominantly expressed in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and that locus was adjacent to the polymorphic transporter for the Ag-processing (TAP2) gene. Characterization of a genomic clone from the same duck now allows us to compare genes to account for their differential expression. The clone carried five MHC class I genes and the TAP genes in the following gene order: TAP1, TAP2, UAA, UBA, UCA, UDA, and UEA. We designated the predominantly expressed gene UAA. Transcripts corresponding to the UDA locus were expressed at a low level. No transcripts were found for three loci, UBA, UCA, and UEA. UBA had a deletion within the promoter sequences. UCA carried a stop codon in-frame. UEA did not have a polyadenylation signal sequence. All sequences differed primarily in peptide-binding pockets and otherwise had the hallmarks of classical MHC class I alleles. Despite the presence of additional genes in the genome, the duck expresses predominantly one MHC class I gene. The limitation to one expressed MHC class I gene may have functional consequences for the ability of ducks to eliminate viral pathogens, such as influenza.
795	16244083	Thallium contamination in wild ducks in Japan.	Mochizuki M, Mori M, Akinaga M, Yugami K, Oya C, Hondo R, Ueda F	J Wildl Dis	 2005 Jul;41(3):664-8	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-413664	Although thallium (Tl) is toxic to both humans and animals, there is little information on contamination in wildlife. In this study, Tl contents in wild ducks in Japan were determined. Contents of Tl in kidney and liver ranged from 0.42 to 119.61 and 0.10 to 33.94 microg/g dry weight, respectively. Significant correlations between Tl contents in kidney and liver were observed for all dabbling ducks except mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); similar correlations were not observed in diving ducks. Variation in Tl content was observed between sampling locations with the highest mean Tl content in the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) collected in Ibaraki Prefecture.
796	16206573	Comparison of nicarbazin absorption in chickens, mallards, and Canada geese.	Yoder CA, Miller LA, Bynum KS	Poult Sci	 2005 Sep;84(9):1491-4	 doi: 101093/ps/8491491	Nicarbazin (NCZ), a coccidiostat commonly used in the poultry industry, causes reduced hatchability and egg quality in layer hens at a concentration of 125 ppm (8.4 mg/kg) in the feed. Although this effect is undesirable in the poultry industry, NCZ could provide a useful wildlife contraception tool for waterfowl, particularly urban geese. We tested the absorption of NCZ in chickens (Gallus gallus), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) gavaged with 8.4 mg of NCZ/kg per bird each day for 8 d. Plasma levels of 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) differed significantly among species. Peak plasma DNC levels were 2.87 +/- 0.15 microg/mL, 2.39 +/- 0.15 microg/mL, and 1.53 +/- 0.15 microg/ mL in chickens, mallards, and Canada geese respectively. It took 6 d to obtain peak DNC levels in chickens as opposed to 8 d in mallards and Canada geese. The half life of DNC in plasma was 1.43 d in chickens, 0.72 d in mallards, and 1.26 d in Canada geese. Mallards eliminated 100% of plasma DNC 4 d post-treatment, whereas Canada geese eliminated 100% of plasma DNC 8 d post-treatment. Chickens had only eliminated 99% of plasma DNC 8 d post-treatment. Mallard plasma DNC levels were highly correlated with Canada goose plasma DNC levels. This research showed mallards are an ideal model species for the Canada goose for future reproductive studies on NCZ in a laboratory setting. However, levels higher than 8.4 mg/kg must be fed to waterfowl in order to obtain a plasma level comparable to chickens.
797	16191707	Granulomatous inflammation of salt glands in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) associated with intralesional Gram-negative bacteria.	Klopfleisch R, Muller C, Polster U, Hildebrandt JP, Teifke JP	Avian Pathol	 2005 Jun;34(3):233-7	 doi: 101080/03079450500112492	The "nasal glands" occur in many bird species and are powerful sodium ion-excretory organs. In ducks, they are located in supraorbital bony recesses. Granulomatous inflammation of these glands occurs with an incidence of approximately 1% in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos), and is not associated with specific clinical symptoms. We investigated nine glands of eight animals with granulomas by gross pathology and histopathology, and compared results of bacteriology with 20 non-lesioned nasal glands. Adenitis was characterized by multifocal to coalescent heterophilic granulomas with central necrotic heterophils, and multinucleate giant cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Within the centres of the granulomas, there were clusters of Gram-negative bacteria that were identified as halo-tolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Aeromonas hydrophila. Normal glands contained exclusively various halo-tolerant Gram-positive bacteria, mostly Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus sp. The distribution of lesions and lack of clinical symptoms were suggestive of a localized ascending infection via the secretory ductules.
798	16182151	A recent chicken repeat 1 retrotransposition confirms the Coscoroba-Cape Barren goose clade.	St John J, Cotter JP, Quinn TW	Mol Phylogenet Evol	 2005 Oct;37(1):83-90	 doi: 101016/jympev200503005 Epub 2005 Apr 9	Chicken repeat 1 (CR1) is a member of the non-long terminal repeat class of retrotransposons. We have isolated a truncated CR1 element within the third intron of the lactate dehydrogenase B gene of the coscoroba and the Cape Barren goose (Anseriformes; Coscoroba coscoroba, Cereopsis novaehollandiae). Because the element was absent in orthologous loci within mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), snow goose (Anser caerulescens), and tundra swan (Cygnus columbianus), it provides strong support to the recent novel proposal by Donne-Gousse et al. [Donne-Gousse, C., Laudet, V., Hanni, C., 2002. A molecular phylogeny of anseriformes based on mitochondrial DNA analysis. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 23, 339-356] that Cape Barren goose is the sister taxon to coscoroba. The time of insertion was approximately 10.5 Mya or less estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence information. Because this is a recent event, the DNA sequence of this CR1 should be close to that existing at the time of its insertion. This is reflected by the consistency of several structural features expected in a new CR1 copy such as the unaltered flanking target site duplication and inverted repeats that lie 22 bp apart near the 3' end of the element. Hybridization experiments show that numerous copies of sequences closely related to the coscoroba CR1 element are dispersed throughout the genomes of tested Anseriformes, but none were detected in representatives of Galliformes and Struthioniformes.
799	16159372	Ultrastructural characteristics of spermiogenesis in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Simoes K, Orsi AM, Viegas KA	Anat Histol Embryol	 2005 Oct;34(5):307-11	 doi: 101111/j1439-0264200500620x	In this present study was observed that the spermatids underwent morphological differentiation and modifications, which primarily comprised nuclear elongation, during the process of spermiogenesis in the domestic duck. The acrosome was formed and the flagellum developed concomitantly with nuclear modifications. Thus, various modifications could be observed during this process, especially changes in the distribution of cytoplasmic organelles. Long cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum present in the spermatid cytoplasm dissociated into vesicles and the distal centriole initiated the development of the flagellum in the cellular portion opposite to the acrosome. The ultrastructure of the spermatids of the domestic duck did not show the characteristic development of pre-acrosomal granules, but the acrosomal granule could be directly visualized in this species.
800	16075271	Attenuation of cell cycle regulator p27(Kip1) expression in vertebrate epithelial cells mediated by extracellular signals in vivo and in vitro.	Rohlfing AK, Schill T, Muller C, Hildebrandt P, Prowald A, Hildebrandt JP	J Comp Physiol B	 2005 Oct;175(7):511-22	 doi: 101007/s00360-005-0019-x Epub 2005 Oct 26	Cell cycle arrest in potentially dividing cells is often mediated by inhibitors of G1/S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin E/CDK2-inhibitor p27(Kip1) has been implicated in this context in epithelial cells. We cloned and sequenced p27(Kip1) of ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) and used an in vitro assay system to study the mechanism of p27(Kip1) downregulation in the nasal gland which precedes an increase in proliferation rate upon initial exposure of the animals to osmotic stress. Western blot studies revealed that p27(Kip1) is downregulated during 24 h of osmotic stress in ducklings with the steepest decline in protein levels between 5 and 8 h. As indicated by the results of Northern blot and semi-quantitative PCR studies, protein downregulation is not accompanied by similar changes in mRNA levels indicating that Kip1 is regulated mainly at the translational (synthesis) or posttranslational level (degradation). Using recombinant duck Kip1 protein expressed in E. coli, we showed that Kip1 is subject to polyubiquitinylation by cytosolic enzymes from nasal gland cells indicating that loss of Kip1 may be regulated, at least in part, by acceleration of protein degradation. In cultured nasal gland tissue, attenuation of Kip1 expression could be induced by activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor indicating that mAChR-receptor signalling may play a role in the re-entry of quiescent gland cells into the cell cycle.
801	16024051	Distribution of trace elements in subcellular fractions of three aquatic birds.	Nam DH, Anan Y, Ikemoto T, Kim EY, Tanabe S	Mar Pollut Bull	 2005;51(8-12):750-6	 doi: 101016/jmarpolbul200506002 Epub 2005 Jul 18	This study investigated the subcellular distribution of Cu, Zn, Cd and Ag in liver of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), spot-billed duck (A. poecilorhyncha) and great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) to better understand metal fractionation and dynamics in avian liver. Most of the total Cu, Zn, Cd and Ag were present in hepatocytosol, and their concentrations increased with total hepatic levels in all the three avian species. Copper, Zn and Cd in hepatocytosol were present mostly in metallothionein fractions (MTs), and Cu and Cd contents in this fraction were positively correlated with hepatocytosol levels in all the species. Silver was observed mostly in both high-molecular weight and MT fractions in hepatocytosol in mallard and great cormorant, whereas it was present in both low-molecular weight and MT fractions in spot-billed duck, suggesting that distribution of Ag in the hepatocytosol was species-specific. The elution profile of metals in MT fractions revealed six metallic peaks in mallard and spot-billed duck, and three peaks in great cormorant, implying the presence of multiple MT isoforms in the liver of these avian species. The present study demonstrated that MTs are closely associated with metal regulation, especially Cu and Cd, in these three aquatic birds.
802	15964231	Changes in lipid composition of hepatocyte plasma membrane induced by overfeeding in duck.	Molee W, Bouillier-Oudot M, Auvergne A, Babile R	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 2005 Aug;141(4):437-44	 doi: 101016/jcbpc200505007	This experiment was carried out to examine the influence of overfeeding ducks with corn on the lipid composition of hepatocyte plasma membrane. Seventy-day-old male Mule ducks (Cairina moschata x Anas platyrhynchos) were overfed with corn for 12.5 days in order to induce fatty livers. The cholesterol and phospholipid contents were approximately 50% higher in hepatocyte plasma membranes from fatty livers compared to those of lean livers obtained from non-overfed ducks. However, the cholesterol/phospholipids molar ratio did not differ between both groups. Overfeeding induced a significant change in phospholipid composition of hepatocyte plasma membrane with a decrease in phosphatidylcholine proportion and conversely an increase in phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acid profile of phospholipids was also altered. In fatty hepatocyte plasma membrane, the overall proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was decreased and this was due to the decrease of some of, but not all, the PUFA. In addition, the proportions of oleic acid and n-9 series unsaturated fatty acids were higher in fatty than in lean liver membranes. This study provides evidence that overfeeding with a carbohydrate-rich corn-based diet induces a de novo hepatic lipogenesis in Mule duck which predominates over dietary lipid intake to change the lipid composition of the hepatocyte plasma membrane.
803	15955364	Comparison of fertility and embryo mortality following artificial insemination of common duck females (Anas Platyrhynchos) with semen from common or Muscovy (Cairina Moschata) drakes.	Sellier N, Brun JM, Richard MM, Batellier F, Dupuy V, Brillard JP	Theriogenology	 2005 Jul 15;64(2):429-39	 doi: 101016/jtheriogenology200412010	The purpose of this study was to compare fertility and early embryo mortality rates (< or = 5 days of incubation) following artificial insemination (AI) of common duck females (Anas Platyrhynchos) with semen from either common or Muscovy (Cairina Moschata) drakes at various periods of the reproductive season (Period I, 27-35 weeks; Period II, 39-43 weeks and Period III, 49-56 weeks). Based on observations performed by stereomicroscopy on eggs laid from Days 2 to 10 after AI, we confirmed that fertility was significantly lower in the interbred compared to the purebred cross at each of the periods tested (purebred 58.1, 61.2 and 54.2 versus crossbred 31.0, 40.4 and 39.5 at Periods I, II and II, respectively; 0.01 < P < 0.001). In a complementary experiment, we demonstrated that the number of perivitelline spermatozoa (NPS) was markedly lower in mule (crossbred) eggs compared to common (purebred) eggs, a strong indication that initial sperm selection occurring in the lower oviduct is probably more intense after crossbred compared to purebred insemination. Comparison of early embryo mortality (EEM) between mule and common duck eggs indicated that increased levels of EEM in mule embryos corresponded to Stages II-IV of the Eyal-Giladi and Kochav classification (EGK). While a similar age-dependent increase in early embryo mortality was observed in eggs from both genetic origins during the latter periods of the reproductive season, it was also established that embryo mortality due to parental age was related rather to Stages X-XIV of the EGK classification in eggs from both genetic origins. It is concluded that the relative subfertility of mule compared to common duck eggs is probably the consequence of a more intense rate of selection of heterologous than homologous spermatozoa occurring in the vaginal portion of the oviduct while the causal origins of EEM in mule duck eggs can at least in part be identified on the basis of precise staging (by stereomicroscopy) of dead embryos.
804	15953200	Studies on itraconazole delivery and pharmacokinetics in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Tell LA, Craigmill AL, Clemons KV, Sun Y, Laizure SC, Clifford A, Ina JH, Nugent-Deal JP, Woods L, Stevens DA	J Vet Pharmacol Ther	 2005 Jun;28(3):267-74	 doi: 101111/j1365-2885200500656x	Avian aspergillosis is commonly treated with itraconazole (ITZ). This paper describes two studies using mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The first study evaluated in vivo release of ITZ from subcutaneously injected controlled-release gel formulations and the second study compared pharmacokinetic parameters for two ITZ oral suspensions. ITZ-A suspension was prepared by mixing contents of commercially available capsules with hydrochloric acid and orange juice. ITZ-B suspension was prepared by dispersing the complex of the drug with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in water. Concentrations of ITZ and its active metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole (OH-ITZ), in plasma and tissue samples were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. In the second study, drug concentrations in plasma samples were also analyzed using a bioassay. After administration of two ITZ controlled-release formulations, plasma and tissue concentrations of ITZ and OH-ITZ were either very low (< or = 52 ng/mL) or undetectable. Exceptions included skin, subcutaneous fat, and muscle adjacent to the injection site. The drug from ITZ-A and ITZ-B suspensions was absorbed after oral administration. ITZ pharmacokinetic parameters for both suspensions in mallard ducks were similar and the bioassay successfully measured ITZ equivalents in plasma samples from ducks.
805	15951252	Imidazole binding reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) inhibits avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptor discharge in vivo.	Pilarski JQ, Hempleman SC	Respir Physiol Neurobiol	 2006 Feb 28;150(2-3):144-54	 doi: 101016/jresp200505009 Epub 2005 Jun 13	Data indicate that avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) transduce CO2 stimuli by sensing the products of CO2 hydration, [H+] and [HCO3-]. The alphastat regulation hypothesis of physiological pH sensitivity suggests that proteins sense [H+] through changes in the ionization state of imidazole groups (alphaIm). To test whether imidazole is involved with IPC CO2 sensitivity, we administered diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) intravenously while recording from IPC exposed to varying levels of inspired CO2. At physiological pH, DEPC converts pH sensitive imidazole groups to pH-insensitive N-carbethoxyhistidyl residues. Single cell extracellular neural recordings were made from vagal filaments in anesthetized, unidirectionally ventilated Anas platyrhynchos. Without DEPC, IPC discharge rate was inversely proportional to inspired CO2 with characteristic dynamic responses to rapid CO2 alterations (n = 10). After DEPC treatment (> or = 15 mM), mean sensitivity of IPC discharge to static inspired CO2 levels was decreased 75% (P < 0.05), and mean peak dynamic IPC discharge rate was decreased 80% (P < 0.05). Additionally, we tested whether DEPC might alter IPC discharge by binding imidazole groups in the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), but we found no effect on CA catalytic rate. We conclude that DEPC inhibits IPC CO2 signal transduction by modifying imidazole groups on acid-sensitive proteins other than CA, possibly membrane acid-base exchangers or ion channels. These data support the alphastat regulation hypothesis in IPC CO2 respiratory chemoreception and suggests a more direct link between H+ and membrane excitability.
806	15943922	Characterization of 35 novel microsatellite DNA markers from the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) genome and cross-amplification in other birds.	Huang Y, Tu J, Cheng X, Tang B, Hu X, Liu Z, Feng J, Lou Y, Lin L, Xu K, Zhao Y, Li N	Genet Sel Evol	 2005 Jul-Aug;37(4):455-72	 doi: 101186/1297-9686-37-5-455	In order to study duck microsatellites, we constructed a library enriched for (CA)n, (CAG)n, (GCC)n and (TTTC)n. A total of 35 pairs of primers from these microsatellites were developed and used to detect polymorphisms in 31 unrelated Peking ducks. Twenty-eight loci were polymorphic and seven loci were monomorphic. A total of 117 alleles were observed from these polymorphic microsatellite markers, which ranged from 2 to 14 with an average of 4.18 per locus. The frequencies of the 117 alleles ranged from 0.02 to 0.98. The highest heterozygosity (0.97) was observed at the CAUD019 microsatellite locus and the lowest heterozygosity (0.04) at the CAUD008 locus, and 11 loci had heterozygosities greater than 0.50 (46.43%). The polymorphism information content (PIC) of 28 loci ranged from 0.04 to 0.88 with an average of 0.42. All the above markers were used to screen the polymorphism in other bird species. Two markers produced specific monomorphic products with the chicken DNA. Fourteen markers generated specific fragments with the goose DNA: 5 were polymorphic and 9 were monomorphic. But no specific product was detected with the peacock DNA. Based on sequence comparisons of the flanking sequence and repeat, we conclude that 2 chicken loci and 14 goose loci were true homologous loci of the duck loci. The microsatellite markers identified and characterized in the present study will contribute to the genetic map, quantitative traits mapping, and phylogenetic analysis in the duck and goose.
807	15936711	Tissue-specific distribution of carotenoids and vitamin E in tissues of newly hatched chicks from various avian species.	Karadas F, Wood NA, Surai PF, Sparks NH	Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol	 2005 Apr;140(4):506-11	 doi: 101016/jcbpb200503002	The aim of this study was to evaluate carotenoid and vitamin E distribution in egg and tissues of newly hatched chicks from wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), game pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), free-range guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), hen (Gallus domesticus) and domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and intensively housed hens. Carotenoid concentrations in the egg yolk of free-range guinea fowl, pheasant and wild mallard were similar (61.3-79.2 microg/g). Egg yolks from ducks and intensively housed hens were characterised by the lowest carotenoid concentration comprising 11.2-14.8 microg/g. However, carotenoid concentration in eggs from free-range ducks and hens was less than half of that in free-range guinea fowl or pheasant. Depending on carotenoid concentration in the livers of species studied could be placed in the following descending order: free living pheasant>free-range guinea fowl>>free-range hen>>intensively housed hen>wild mallard>>housed duck>free-range duck. The carotenoid concentrations in other tissues of free-range guinea fowl and pheasant were substantially higher than in the other species studied. Egg yolk of housed hens was characterised by the highest alpha- and gamma-tocopherol concentrations. In accordance with the alpha-tocopherol concentration in the egg yolk, the birds can be placed in the following descending order: intensively housed hen>wild mallard>free-living pheasant>free-range duck>free-range hen=free-range guinea fowl>housed duck. The main finding of this work is species- and tissue-specific differences in carotenoid and vitamin E distribution in the various avian species studied.
808	15921605	Surveillance on severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus in animals at a live animal market of Guangzhou in 2004	Wang M, Jing HQ, Xu HF, Jiang XG, Kan B, Liu QY, Wan KL, Cui BY, Zheng H, Cui ZG, Yan MY, Liang WL, Wang HX, Qi XB, Li ZJ, Li MC, Chen K, Zhang EM, Zhang SY, Hai R, Yu DZ, Xu JG	Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi	 2005 Feb;26(2):84-7		OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) like virus in animals at a live animal market of Guanzhou in 2004 before and after culling of wild animal action taken by the local authority, in order to predict the re-emerging of SARS from animal originals in this region. METHODS: Animals at live animal market were sampled for rectal and throat swabs in triplicate. A single step realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic kit was performed for screening SARS-CoV like virus, the manual nested RT- PCR and DNA sequencing were performed for confirmation. Only specimens which tested positive for both of the N and P genes by nested RT-PCR were scored as positive. RESULTS: In 31 animals sampled in January 5 2004 before culling of wild animals at Guangdong Province, including 20 cats (Felis catus), 5 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and 6 Lesser rice field rats (Rattus losea), 8 (25.8%) animals were tested positive for SARS-CoV like virus by RT-PCR methods, of which 4 cats, 3 red fox and one Lesser rice field rats were included. However, two weeks after culling of animals and disinfection of the market were implemented, in 119 animals sampled in January 20 2004, including 6 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), 13 cats, 46 red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), 13 spotbill duck (Anas platyrhynchos), 10 greylag goose (Anser anser), 31 Chinese francolin (Franclinus pintadeanus), only rectal swab from one greylag goose was tested positive for SARS-CoV like virus. Furthermore, in 102 animals that including 14 greylag gooses, 3 cats, 5 rabbits, 9 spotbill duck (Anaspoecilorhyncha), 2 Chinese francolin (Franclinus pintadeanus), 8 common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), 6 pigeons, 9 Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), 19 wild boar (Sus scrofa), 16 Lesser rice field rats, 5 dogs, 1 mink (Mustela vison), 3 goats, 2 green peafowl (Pavo muticus) sampled in April, May, June, July, August and November, only rectal swab from one pig was tested positive. However, of 12 and 10 palm civets sampled in November and December including five of which had been at the live animals market for 2 days, none of them was tested positive. CONCLUSION: This findings revealed that animals being sampled in April, May, June, July, August and November of 2004, only one rectal swab from a pig was tested positive as SARS-CoV like virus, much lower than the results from the previous year, suggesting that the possibility of re-emerging of human infection from animal origins is low for the winter of 2004-2005.
809	15914837	Molecular identification and characterization of novel coronaviruses infecting graylag geese (Anser anser), feral pigeons (Columbia livia) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Jonassen CM, Kofstad T, Larsen IL, Lovland A, Handeland K, Follestad A, Lillehaug A	J Gen Virol	 2005 Jun;86(Pt 6):1597-1607	 doi: 101099/vir080927-0	In light of the finding of a previously unknown coronavirus as the aetiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is probable that other coronaviruses, than those recognized to date, are circulating in animal populations. Here, the results of a screening for coronavirus are presented, using a universal coronavirus RT-PCR, of the bird species graylag goose (Anser anser), feral pigeon (Columbia livia) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Coronaviruses were found in cloacal swab samples from all the three bird species. In the graylag goose, 40 of 163 sampled birds were coronavirus positive, whereas two of 100 sampled pigeons and one of five sampled mallards tested positive. The infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared with virus-negative birds, suggesting clinical significance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyses performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences, indicated that the novel coronaviruses described in the present study all branch off from group III coronaviruses. All the novel avian coronaviruses harboured the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3' untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses, evidenced the presence of two additional open reading frames for the goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for the pigeon coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.
810	15892059	Avian vacuolar myelinopathy linked to exotic aquatic plants and a novel cyanobacterial species.	Wilde SB, Murphy TM, Hope CP, Habrun SK, Kempton J, Birrenkott A, Wiley F, Bowerman WW, Lewitus AJ	Environ Toxicol	 2005 Jun;20(3):348-53	 doi: 101002/tox20111	Invasions of exotic species have created environmental havoc through competition and displacement of native plants and animals. The introduction of hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) into the United States in the 1960s has been detrimental to navigation, power generation, water intake, and water quality (McCann et al., 1996). Our field surveys and feeding studies have now implicated exotic hydrilla and associated epiphytic cyanobacterial species as a link to avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM), an emerging avian disease affecting herbivorous waterbirds and their avian predators. AVM, first reported in 1994, has caused the death of at least 100 bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and thousands of American coots (Fulica americana) at 11 sites from Texas to North Carolina (Thomas et al., 1998; Rocke et al., 2002). Our working hypothesis is that the agent of this disease is an uncharacterized neurotoxin produced by a novel cyanobacterial epiphyte of the order Stigonematales. This undescribed species covers up to 95% of the surface area of leaves in reservoirs where bird deaths have occurred from the disease. In addition, this species is rare or not found on hydrilla collected at sites where AVM disease has not been diagnosed. Laboratory feeding trials and a sentinel bird study using naturally occurring blooms of cyanobacteria on hydrilla leaves and farm-raised mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) induced the disease experimentally. Since 1994 AVM has been diagnosed in additional sites from Texas to North Carolina. Specific site characteristics that produce the disjunct distribution of AVM are unknown, but it is probable that the incidence of this disease will increase with the introduction of hydrilla and associated cyanobacterial species into additional ponds, lakes, and reservoirs.
811	15887091	Redistribution of extracellular water and sodium may contribute to saline tolerance in wild ducks.	Bennett DC, Gray DA, Sharp PJ, Hughes MR	Physiol Biochem Zool	 2005 May-Jun;78(3):447-55	 doi: 101086/430043 Epub 2005 Apr 28	The compartmentalization of body fluids was measured in three species of ducks that differ in saline tolerance. Half of the birds of each species drank freshwater, while the other half drank saline (300 mM NaCl). Among ducks that drank freshwater, total body water (TBW) was similar among all species, but Barrow's goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), the most marine species, had larger extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) than freshwater mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) or estuarine canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria). When acclimated to saline, only goldeneyes shifted extracellular water and Na+ into the intracellular compartment. ECFV was correlated with plasma aldosterone concentration in goldeneyes, but not in canvasbacks (aldosterone was not measured in mallards). Data summarized from the literature showed that TBW does not differ among terrestrial, freshwater, or marine species, but marine species have a larger part of their TBW in the extracellular compartment. Saline induced movement of extracellular water and Na+ into the cells only in goldeneyes. ECFV and redistribution of extracellular water and Na+ into the cells may be important components in saline tolerance of marine birds.
812	15841394	Identification, sequence characterization, and analysis of expression profiles of three novel CC chemokines from domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Sreekumar E, Premraj A, Arathy DS, Rasool TJ	Immunogenetics	 2005 Jun;57(5):364-73	 doi: 101007/s00251-005-0796-0 Epub 2005 Apr 20	Chemokines are low-molecular weight-chemotactic cytokines, which are involved in lymphocyte trafficking and migration of leucocytes to sites of injury, in immune surveillance and in healing process. They also play a role in pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Three novel CC chemokines were identified from domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) by screening of an enriched cDNA library constructed from mitogen-stimulated splenic mononuclear cells. Two of the clones (AB163 and AB330) had a very high nucleotide (both about 81%) and predicted amino acid level (71 and 76%, respectively) identity to the reported chicken macrophage inflammatory protein 1-beta (MIP-1beta; SCYA4) and regulated upon activation of normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES; SCYA5) sequences. In phylogenetic analysis, these molecules clustered together with corresponding chemokines reported from other vertebrates. The third clone (AB187) had highest homology to chicken MIP-1beta (36% amino acid identity) and showed closer relation to a number of chemokines belonging to monocyte chemoattractant proteins and MIP-1alpha chemokines. Expression of these molecules was upregulated upon mitogen stimulation of splenocytes as detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR. AB187 showed several fold increases (about 8.5 times) in the mRNA expression. Basal level expression of some of these chemokines was detected in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, including spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow. Considering the importance of this animal species as a model for diseases such as chronic human hepatitis B, further studies will offer valuable insights into the role of these molecules in immunopathology of such diseases.
813	15839428	Resistance of Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) to experimental inoculation with Mycobacterium bovis.	Fitzgerald SD, Boland KG, Clarke KR, Wismer A, Kaneene JB, Berry DE, Church SV, Hattey JA, Bolin CA	Avian Dis	 2005 Mar;49(1):144-6	 doi: 101637/7247-073004R1	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) are susceptible to infection with Mycobacterium bovis by either oral or intratracheal inoculation and to assess their potential role in the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Six ducks were orally inoculated with 1.0 x 10(5) colony-forming units of M. bovis, six ducks were intratracheally inoculated with the same dose, and six ducks served as sham-inoculated controls. The study length was 90 days postinoculation, with samples of two birds from each group necropsied at 30-day intervals. Both fecal and tissue samples were collected for mycobacterial culture. None of the inoculated ducks shed M. bovis in their feces at any culture point (days 1, 30, and 60) during the study. No evidence of illness or weight loss was present during the course of the study, and only one duck had M. bovis isolated from any tissue, although there were no associated microscopic lesions. Mallard ducks were highly resistant to infection with M. bovis following high-dose inoculation and did not shed the organism in their feces. This study was conducted using high-dose inoculation; therefore, it appears that ducks are unlikely to play any significant role in the transmission of M. bovis between infected and uninfected mammalian hosts.
814	15839421	The effect of route of inoculation and challenge dosage on Riemerella anatipestifer infection in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Sarver CF, Morishita TY, Nersessian B	Avian Dis	 2005 Mar;49(1):104-7	 doi: 101637/7248-073004R1	Riemerella anatipestifer is a gram-negative bacteria that can cause disease in a wide variety of wild and domesticated birds, especially waterfowl. The infection can be peracute, acute, or chronic. Although various routes of transmission have been proposed, to date, there is little information on the effects of route of transmission and challenge dosage on R. anatipestifer infection. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of route of inoculation and challenge dosage on R. anatipestifer infection and pathology. To achieve this objective, one hundred forty-seven 14-day-old white Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were equally divided into 13 experimental groups (12 challenge and 1 control group). Each challenge group had 11 ducks. The control group had 15 ducks. Four routes of inoculation were evaluated (intranasal, oral, subcutaneous, and intravenous). Three dosage levels were evaluated for each inoculation route (10(2), 10(4), and 106 colony forming units [CFU]/ml). At the 106 CFU/ml dosage level, mortality was most associated with the subcutaneous (91%) and intravenous (82%) routes, followed by the nasal (18%) and oral (9%) routes. A unique pathologic lesion was found in the bursa of Fabricius and spleen of affected birds. Within the spleen and bursa of Fabricius, there were varying degrees of lymphoid depletion and necrosis within the cortical and medullary regions. These pathologic lesions have not been previously reported in ducks with R. anatipestifer infection.
815	15827222	Attempts to identify the source of avian vacuolar myelinopathy for waterbirds.	Rocke TE, Thomas NJ, Meteyer CU, Quist CF, Fischer JR, Augspurger T, Ward SE	J Wildl Dis	 2005 Jan;41(1):163-70	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-411163	Attempts were made to reproduce avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) in a number of test animals in order to determine the source of the causative agent for birds and to find a suitable animal model for future studies. Submerged vegetation, plankton, invertebrates, forage fish, and sediments were collected from three lakes with ongoing outbreaks of AVM and fed to American coots (Fulica americana), mallard ducks and ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos), quail (Coturnix japonica), and laboratory mice either via gavage or ad libitum. Tissues from AVM-affected coots with brain lesions were fed to ducklings, kestrels (Falco sparverius), and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Two mallards that ingested one sample of Hydrilla verticillata along with any biotic or abiotic material associated with its external surface developed brain lesions consistent with AVM, although neither of the ducks had clinical signs of disease. Ingestion of numerous other samples of Hydrilla from the AVM affected lakes and a lake with no prior history of AVM, other materials (sediments, algae, fish, invertebrates, and water from affected lakes), or tissues from AVM-affected birds did not produce either clinical signs or brain lesions in any of the other test animals in our studies. These results suggest that waterbirds are most likely exposed to the causative agent of AVM while feeding on aquatic vegetation, but we do not believe the vegetation itself is the agent. We hypothesize that the causative agent of AVM might either be accumulated by aquatic vegetation, such as Hydrilla, or associated with biotic or abiotic material on its external surfaces. In support of that hypothesis, two coots that ingested Hydrilla sampled from a lake with an ongoing AVM outbreak in wild birds developed neurologic signs within 9 days (ataxia, limb weakness, and incoordination), and one of two coots that ingested Hydrilla collected from the same site 13 days later became sick and died within 38 days. None of these three sick coots had definitive brain lesions consistent with AVM by light microscopy, but they had no gross or histologic lesions in other tissues. It is unclear if these birds died of AVM. Perhaps they did not ingest a dose sufficient to produce brain lesions or the lesions were ultrastructural. Alternatively, it is possible that a separate neurotoxic agent is responsible for the morbidity and mortality observed in these coots.
816	15810558	Distribution of trematodes of the family Prosthogonimidae in river and lake ecological systems in the south of the Western Siberia	Serbina EA	Parazitologiia	 2005 Jan-Feb;39(1):50-65		The results of long-term investigations (1994-2003) of an infection rate of trematodes of the family Prosthogonimidae in the first intermediate hosts (snails of the family Bithyniidae) and in the final hosts (birds) from a basin of the Chany Lake (Western Siberia) are discussed. A total of 1824 specimens of Bithynia tentaculata (L., 1758) and 7166 specimens of Opisthorchophorus troscheli (Paasch, 1842) have been collected from eight rivers and two lakes in the south of the Western Siberia. Data of incomplete helminthological dissection of 225 young water-fowl of 18 species were analyzed. Birds were obtained in July, August and September, 1996-2003 from the Chany lake basin. Maritas of the trematode family Prosthogonimidae were revealed in bursa Fabricii (26.12%) of seven bird species of two orders (Anseriformes and Gruiformes): Grey Lag-Goose Anser anser (L.) (Infection rate-28.6% +/- 12.1), Mallard Anas platyrhynchos L. (27.5% +/- 6.2), Shoveler--A. clypeata L. (22.2% +/- 13.9), Pochard Aythya ferina (L.) (51.7% +/- 9.3), Coot Fulica atra L. (28.6% +/- 5.6), Tufted Duck A. fuligula (L.) (1 case), Wigeon A. penelope L. (1 case). Average intensity of invasion is 5.8 marita specimens per infected bird. The maximal number of parasites (37 maritas), and also the highest average intensity of invasion are recorded for the Coot. The 342 maritas of the family Prosthogonimidae belong to three species: Prosthogonimus ovatus (Rud., 1803) (49.7%), P. cuneatus (Rud., 1809) (32.8%) and Schistogonimus rarus (Braun, 1901) (14.6%); these trematode species have been recorded in 35, 12 and 8 bird species, respectively. Grey Lag-Goose, Shoveler, Pochard and Tufted Duck are new host records for P. cuneatus in for Western Siberia. Parthenitae of trematodes (Prosthogonimidae) were revealed from eight populations of bithyniid snails. The infection rate of the trematodes (parthenitae and cercariae) in population of bithyniid snails from lake ecological system varied 6.55-54.4%, and in river ecological systems in was 0.6-4.2 %. The infection rate of trematodes (parthenitae and cercariae) of the first intermediate hosts was 2.64% that is significantly lower than that of the final hosts from the Chany Lake basin. Both O. troscheli and B. tentaculata were noted as the first intermediate hosts of prosthogonimid trematodes of three species: P. ovatus, P. cuneatus and S. rarus. All three species of trematode were found in three water reservoirs: Ob River (B. tentaculata), Kargat River (O. troscheli) and Chany Lake (O. troscheli). Thus it is found out that 39 bird species can be the final hosts of prosthogonimid trematodes. About a quarter of nestlings is infected with these trematodes. The infection rate of parthenitae in snails from the lake ecosystems is significantly higher than in the river ecosystems.
817	15805046	Effects of pentabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE-99) on vitamin status in domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) hatchlings.	Murvoll KM, Jenssen BM, Skaare JU	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2005 Apr 9;68(7):515-33	 doi: 101080/15287390590909652	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) used to prevent fire are found in several products, such as textiles, electronics, and building materials. They are lipophilic and persistent substances, and their toxicological endpoints resemble those of polychlorinated bipenyls (PCBs). One of the most abundant congeners of PBDEs in wildlife is the 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE-99). To study the effect of PBDE-99 on vitamin status in birds and evaluate the possible application of vitamins as biomarkers for use in monitoring of wildlife, eggs of domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) were exposed by yolk sac injection to environmental realistic doses of this congener (0.1, 1, or 10 ng/g ww). Levels of retinol (vitamin A), retinyl palmitate, and a-tocopherol (vitamin E) were measured in the liver of the newly hatched chicks, and levels of retinol and tocopherol were also measured in plasma. Liver tocopherol levels correlated negatively to the exposure to PBDE-99. This is an indication that exposure to PBDE-99 reduces levels of tocopherol in liver. Thus, tocopherol seems to be a potential useful biomarker for exposure to PBDEs in bird species.
818	15782624	Detection of influenza A virus by RT-PCR and standard methods in experimental infection of Ducks.	Foni E, Chiapponi C, Lori D, De Marco MA, Delogu M, Raffini E, Massi P	New Microbiol	 2005 Jan;28(1):31-5		Cloacal swabs collected from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) experimentally infected with a H7N1 avian influenza strain were examined by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect the influenza A virus. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction was compared with standard methods: inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs and inoculation of three established cell lines: Newborn Swine Kidney cells, Newborn Pig Trachea cells and Madine Darby Canine Kidney cells. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed using a set of primers based on conserved regions of the matrix and nucleoprotein genes.
819	15777815	Linear social dominance hierarchy and corticosterone responses in male mallards and pintails.	Poisbleau M, Fritz H, Guillon N, Chastel O	Horm Behav	 2005 Apr;47(4):485-92	 doi: 101016/jyhbeh200501001	In winter, dabbling ducks gather in large flocks and males compete not only for food resources but also for mates. Setting up a social hierarchy is one way to reduce the costs of conflicts, but the position in the hierarchy has implications for individuals, for instance their susceptibility to conflict and interference, hence to social stress. We investigated relationships between linear social dominance and corticosterone levels, baseline levels and induced-stress response, in captive male mallards Anas platyrhynchos and pintails Anas acuta during the winter period. We hypothesised that corticosterone responses would reflect the costs associated with social stress. From previous work on dominance and corticosterone in wintering birds, we expected that, where the social hierarchy is linear, there would be (1) no relationship between social ranks and baseline corticosterone levels and (2) a significant positive relationship between dominance ranks and responses to acute stress. Our results demonstrated the existence of a linear hierarchy in both species (h' = 0.95 for mallards and h' = 0.97 for pintails), and we found that pintails had on average more corticosterone than mallards. The relationship between dominance and corticosterone responses followed the predictions, with no differences for baseline levels and an attenuated response to induced-stress for subordinates. We discuss these results in the perspective of the cost-benefits of dominance and wintering strategies of waterbirds.
820	15763726	Pathological study of naturally occurring adenocarcinomas demonstrating differentiation in ducks.	Yamamoto S, Fukui D, Yokota T, Hikita M, Ishikawa Y, Shibahara T, Kadota K	Avian Pathol	 2004 Dec;33(6):581-5	 doi: 101080/03079450400013238	Case 1, a mucinous adenocarcinoma, was in the pancreas of a 5-year-old male mandarin duck. The tumour comprised a single layer of duct-like structures with abundant fibrous stroma. The neoplastic cells produced a large amount of mucin, and dense or moderately dense mucin granules were observed ultrastructurally. Case 2 was a 1-year-old male mandarin duck, which had a type II pneumocytoid carcinoma within the thoracic air sacs. Light microscopy revealed papillary growths composed of stratified neoplastic epithelium. At the ultrastructural level, the tumour cells had osmiophilic lamellar granules in the cytoplasm. Case 3, a ciliated cell adenocarcinoma with squamous metaplasia, was detected in the right lung of a 2-year-old male domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos forma domestica). The neoplasm consisted of tubular structures with areas of squamous differentiation in places. The presence of cilia was confirmed by electron microscopy. The three adenocarcinomas appeared high-grade or moderate-grade malignant tumours in some aspects, but showed granules or cilia that are suggestive of their origin. The presence of cells retaining the capacity for differentiating into well-differentiated cells may be characteristic of sporadically occurring avian adenocarcinomas.
821	15720008	Impact of oil-sands based wetlands on the growth of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings.	Gurney KE, Williams TD, Smits JE, Wayland M, Trudeau S, Bendell-Young LI	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2005 Feb;24(2):457-63	 doi: 101897/03-5751	Identifying the potential effects of industrially formed wetlands on waterfowl populations is important for assessing the suitability of such wetlands in industrial reclamation strategies. Mallard ducklings were held in situ on two industrially formed wetlands and one reference wetland in northern Alberta, Canada. Duckling mass and skeletal size were measured at regular intervals over 33 d, and blood was collected to investigate the analysis of plasma metabolites (triglyceride and glycerol) as an indicator of physiological condition. In repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate ANOVA, and subsequent multiple-comparisons tests, body mass and skeletal size were significantly lower in ducklings maintained on the industrial wetland after 2, 5, 9, and 13 d of exposure. In this situation, plasma metabolite analysis did not provide additional information on mass-independent condition. We conclude that if the observed differences in growth and size translate into a decreased survival of juvenile waterfowl inhabiting these wetlands, then populations of these birds in the area could be negatively affected. We emphasize the importance of field-based ecological research in toxicological studies of wildlife.
822	15597192	Expression of agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland of the duck ( Anas platyrhynchos).	Mirabella N, Esposito V, Squillacioti C, De Luca A, Paino G	Anat Embryol (Berl)	 2004 Dec;209(2):137-41	 doi: 101007/s00429-004-0431-0 Epub 2004 Nov 5	The presence and distribution of agouti-related protein (AgRP) immunoreactivity were investigated in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland of the duck using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Expression of AgRP mRNA was also studied using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A partial coding sequence (cds) of the duck AgRP gene was identified. Western blot analysis showed the presence of an AgRP-like peptide having a molecular weight consistent with the number of predicted amino acids of the avian AgRP. In the hypothalamus, AgRP immunoreactivity was found in neurons of the nucleus infundibularis and in fibers projecting to the median eminence. In the adrenals, AgRP immunoreactivity was observed in medullary cells. These findings suggest that in the duck, AgRP may play a role in regulating energy homeostasis and adrenal endocrine functions.
823	15579551	Partitioning heat loss from mallard ducklings swimming on the air-water interface.	Banta MR, Lynott AJ, Vansant MJ, Bakken GS	J Exp Biol	 2004 Dec;207(Pt 26):4551-7	 doi: 101242/jeb01313	Water birds whose young begin swimming while downy are interesting because hypothermia and mortality are associated with wetting. While wetting is known to increase heat loss, little is known about basic issues, such as the amount of heat lost to air vs water during surface swimming. To partition heat loss to air and water, we measured the body temperature, metabolism and thermal conductance of 2-3-day-old mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) swimming under different combinations of air and water temperature. Ventral down remained dry or was wetted only on the surface, and most ducklings could maintain Tb>39 degrees C for 1 h while swimming on water as cold as 5 degrees C. Ducklings were at or below thermal neutrality when swimming in water at Tw=30 degrees C even when air temperature Ta=45 degrees C. Heat loss from ducklings with dry down to air and water was partitioned by fitting data to a heat transfer model of the form M=G(Tb-Tw)+Ke(Tb-Ta). For an average 48 g duckling, thermal conductance to water increased with water temperature, G=0.0470(1+1.059 x 10(-6)Tw4)W/ degrees C-animal. Conductance to air was Ke=0.0196 W/ degrees C-animal for all air temperatures. Thus, a minimum of 70% of metabolic heat production is lost to water, and this fraction increases with increasing temperature.
824	15465716	Establishing a food-chain link between aquatic plant material and avian vacuolar myelinopathy in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Birrenkott AH, Wilde SB, Hains JJ, Fischer JR, Murphy TM, Hope CP, Parnell PG, Bowerman WW	J Wildl Dis	 2004 Jul;40(3):485-92	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-403485	Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) is a neurologic disease primarily affecting bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and American coots (Fulica americana). The disease was first characterized in bald eagles in Arkansas in 1994 and then in American coots in 1996. To date, AVM has been confirmed in six additional avian species. Attempts to identify the etiology of AVM have been unsuccessful to date. The objective of this study was to evaluate dermal and oral routes of exposure of birds to hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) and associated materials to evaluate their ability to induce AVM. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were used in all trials; bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) also were used in one fresh hydrilla material exposure trial. Five trials were conducted, including two fresh hydrilla material exposure trials, two cyanobacteria exposure trials, and a frozen hydrilla material exposure trial. The cyanobacteria exposure trials and frozen hydrilla material trial involved gavaging mallards with either Pseudanabaena catenata (live culture), Hapalosiphon fontinalis, or frozen hydrilla material with both cyanobacteria species present. With the exception of one fresh hydrilla exposure trial, results were negative or inconclusive. In the 2002 hydrilla material exposure trial, six of nine treated ducks had histologic lesions of AVM. This established the first cause-effect link between aquatic vegetation and AVM and provided evidence supporting an aquatic source for the causal agent.
825	15369835	Dietary daidzein influences laying performance of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and early post-hatch growth of their hatchlings by modulating gene expression.	Zhao R, Wang Y, Zhou Y, Ni Y, Lu L, Grossmann R, Chen J	Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol	 2004 Aug;138(4):459-66	 doi: 101016/jcbpb200406004	Our previous studies demonstrated that dietary supplementation of daidzein improves egg production in duck breeders during late periods of the laying cycle. The present study was aimed to clarify whether the growth of ducklings hatched from eggs laid by daidzein-treated hens would be affected, and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying potential trans-generational effects, by determining changes of hormone levels and mRNA expression of relevant genes. Daidzein was added to the basal diet of 415-day-old duck breeders at the level of 5 mg/kg. During 9 weeks of daidzein treatment, laying rate increased by 7.70%, average egg mass tended to increase, whereas yolk/albumen ratio decreased significantly. These changes were accompanied by significantly elevated plasma T4 and E2 levels, enhanced gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) mRNA, but diminished estrogen receptor (ER)-beta mRNA expression in hypothalamus of daidzein-treated hens. Ducklings hatched from daidzein-treated eggs were significantly smaller at hatching, but they caught up with their control counterparts by 4 weeks of age. Serum levels of T4, pituitary GH, hepatic GH receptor (GHR) and type-1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R) mRNA expression were all suppressed markedly in the daidzein-treated group at hatching, but this suppression proved to be temporary, as at 4 weeks of age, expression levels of all investigated genes were restored. However, it is noteworthy that at 4 weeks of age an obvious down-regulation of hypothalamic GnRH mRNA expression was detected in ducklings maternally exposed to daidzein. Our results provide evidence that maternal exposure to daidzein affects post-hatch growth in the duck with accompanying changes in the secretion of metabolic hormones and expression of growth-related genes. Although the negative effect of maternal daidzein on embryonic growth could be eliminated 4 weeks after hatching, the long-term effect of maternal daidzein on reproductive function is not to be ignored and awaits further investigation.
826	15345473	Vertebrate phylogeny of hydrogen sulfide vasoactivity.	Dombkowski RA, Russell MJ, Schulman AA, Doellman MM, Olson KR	Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol	 2005 Jan;288(1):R243-52	 doi: 101152/ajpregu003242004 Epub 2004 Sep 2	Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a recently identified endogenous vasodilator in mammals. In steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Osteichthyes), H(2)S produces both dose-dependent dilation and a unique dose-dependent constriction. In this study, we examined H(2)S vasoactivity in all vertebrate classes to determine whether H(2)S is universally vasoactive and to identify phylogenetic and/or environmental trends. H(2)S was generated from NaHS and examined in unstimulated and precontracted systemic and, when applicable, pulmonary arteries (PA) from Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti, Agnatha), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus, Agnatha), sandbar shark (Carcharhinus milberti, Chondrichthyes), marine toad (Bufo marinus, Amphibia), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis, Reptilia), Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus, Aves), and white rat (Rattus rattus, Mammalia). In otherwise unstimulated vessels, NaHS produced 1) a dose-dependent relaxation in Pacific hagfish dorsal aorta; 2) a dose-dependent contraction in sea lamprey dorsal aorta, marine toad aorta, alligator aorta and PA, duck aorta, and rat thoracic aorta; 3) a threshold relaxation in shark ventral aorta, dorsal aorta, and afferent branchial artery; and 4) a multiphasic contraction-relaxation-contraction in the marine toad PA, duck PA, and rat PA. Precontraction of these vessels with another agonist did not affect the general pattern of NaHS vasoactivity with the exception of the rat aorta, where relaxation was now dominant. These results show that H(2)S is a phylogenetically ancient and versatile vasoregulatory molecule that appears to have been opportunistically engaged to suit both organ-specific and species-specific homeostatic requirements.
827	15327119	Posthatch growth of the digestive system in wild and domesticated ducks.	Watkins EJ, Butler PJ, Kenyon BP	Br Poult Sci	 2004 Jun;45(3):331-41	 doi: 101080/00071660410001730824	1. Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that domestication and artificial selection have influenced the posthatch growth and functioning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of ducks. The mass and length of the GI tract organs, the growth of intestinal villi, the intestinal surface area and the activities of brush border digestive enzymes were measured in a commercial strain of Pekin duck and its wild ancestor, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), at regular intervals between hatch and 16 weeks of age. 2. The growth of the digestive organs, with respect to body mass, was described using allometry. Allometric mass exponents were then used to calculate body 'mass-corrected', or 'relative' organ masses, relative surface areas and relative enzyme activities. There were appreciable differences between data presented on a mass-specific (g/kg) and a mass-corrected (g/kg(b)) basis, which highlighted the importance of correcting for the complete effects of body mass when comparing the growth and function of the digestive system between strains. 3. While the process of domestication has induced major changes in the absolute characteristics of the GI tract, it has failed to have the same effect on the relative characteristics. During the first 2 weeks posthatch, the relative masses of the majority of digestive organs, and the GI tract as a whole, were the same in both strains. During weeks 3 to 5, domesticated ducks maintained higher absolute growth rates of the body and the GI tract, with the support of relatively smaller digestive organs. The relative masses of the small intestine and the GI tract as a whole were 45 and 66% higher respectively in mallards than in Pekin ducks during this period. 4. Domesticated ducks had elevated digestive enzyme activity and a greater absorptive surface area than mallards throughout development, both in absolute and relative terms. This appears to compensate for the failure of the relative masses of digestive organs in domesticated ducks to accompany the increased body mass and growth rate. 5. At 5 weeks posthatch, the absolute mass of the small intestine in domesticated ducks declined by 38%. There is no obvious explanation for this decline because the masses of other digestive organs, daily feed intake and body mass continued to rise.
828	15276981	Susceptibility of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) to experimental infection with Toxoplasma gondii oocysts.	Bartova E, Dvorakova H, Barta J, Sedlak K, Literak I	Avian Pathol	 2004 Apr;33(2):153-7	 doi: 101080/03079450310001652068	A total of 28 domestic ducks were divided into seven groups of four ducks. Six groups were inoculated per os with 10(1), 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), 10(5) and 10(5.7) oocysts Toxoplasma gondii oocysts (K21 strain, which is avirulent for mice), and the remaining group was used as a control. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in all ducks by the indirect fluorescence antibody test first on day 7 post-inoculation (p.i.). Antibody titres were found in the range of 1:20 to 1:640 depending on the infectious dose of the oocysts. From day 14 p.i. antibody titres increased to 1:80 to 1:20 480. Between days 14 and 28 p.i. (end of the experiment), antibody titres decreased in 14 ducks, remained the same in seven ducks, and continued to increase in three ducks. Bioassay in mice revealed T. gondii in the breast and leg muscles and the heart (100%, n=47), brain (91%, n=22), liver (54%, n=13) and stomach (46%, n=24). The infected ducks showed no clinical signs; however, the results of bioassay indicate that, compared with some gallinaceous birds, domestic ducks were relatively susceptible to T. gondii infection.
829	15276269	Determining the background levels of bismuth in tissues of wild game birds: a first step in addressing the environmental consequences of using bismuth shotshells.	Jayasinghe R, Tsuji LJ, Gough WA, Karagatzides JD, Perera D, Nieboer E	Environ Pollut	 2004 Nov;132(1):13-20	 doi: 101016/jenvpol200404002	Bismuth shotshells have been approved as a "nontoxic" alternative to lead in North America. Approval was based on a limited number of studies; even background levels of bismuth in wildfowl were unknown. We report on the concentration of bismuth (and lead) in muscle and liver tissues of wildfowl (Anas platyrhynchos, Anas acuta, Anas crecca, Branta canadensis, Chen caerulescens) harvested with lead shotshell. Average liver-bismuth levels detected in the present study (e.g., teal, 0.05 microg/g dw; mallard, 0.09 microg/g dw) suggest analytical error in other studies examining the effects of bismuth in birds. Significant positive relationships between bismuth- and lead-tissue levels for muscle when all species were combined (and for B. canadensis and C. caerulescens separately) can be explained by noting that bismuth is a contaminant of lead. Thus, more research is recommended to confirm the appropriateness of bismuth as a "nontoxic" shot alternative.
830	15253052	Phosphorus amendment reduces bioavailability of lead to mallards ingesting contaminated sediments.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Audet DJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2004 May;46(4):534-41	 doi: 101007/s00244-003-3036-3	Lead poisoning of waterfowl has been reported for decades in the Coeur d'Alene River Basin in Idaho as a result of the ingestion of lead-contaminated sediments. We conducted a study to determine whether the addition of phosphoric acid to sediments would reduce the bioavailability of lead to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). When sediments were amended with 1% phosphorus under laboratory conditions, and diets containing 12% amended sediment were fed to mallards, reductions in tissue lead were 43% in blood, 41% in liver, and 59% in kidney with sediment containing about 4,520 microg/g lead on a dry-weight basis and 41, 30, and 57% with sediment containing about 6,990 microg/g lead. When sediments were treated with phosphorus and left to age for about 5 months in the field, reductions in lead were 56% in blood, 54% in liver, and 66% in kidney at one site with about 5,390 microg/g lead and 64, 57, and 77% at a second site with about 6,990 microg/g lead. In the field, the inability to mix the phosphoric acid uniformly and deeply enough into the sediment may have resulted in more than 1% phosphorus being added to the sediment. Although both lab and field amendments of phosphorus substantially reduced the bioavailability of lead, lead concentrations in the tissues of mallards fed the amended sediments were still above those believed to be harmful to waterfowl. Based on earlier studies of sediment toxicity to waterfowl in the Coeur d'Alene River Basin, combined with the results of our amendment study, the addition of phosphoric acid as we used it might only significantly benefit waterfowl where sediments or soils contain less than 1,000-2,000 microg/g lead.
831	15205935	The dominant MHC class I gene is adjacent to the polymorphic TAP2 gene in the duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Mesa CM, Thulien KJ, Moon DA, Veniamin SM, Magor KE	Immunogenetics	 2004 Jun;56(3):192-203	 doi: 101007/s00251-004-0672-3 Epub 2004 May 27	We are investigating the expression and linkage of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes in the duck ( Anas platyrhynchos) with a view toward understanding the susceptibility of ducks to two medically important viruses: influenza A and hepatitis B. In mammals, there are multiple MHC class I loci, and alleles at a locus are polymorphic and co-dominantly expressed. In contrast, in lower vertebrates the expression of one locus predominates. Southern-blot analysis and amplification of genomic sequences suggested that ducks have at least four loci encoding MHC class I. To identify expressed MHC genes, we constructed an unamplified cDNA library from the spleen of a single duck and screened for MHC class I. We sequenced 44 positive clones and identified four MHC class I sequences, each sharing approximately 85% nucleotide identity. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to a Northern blot indicated that only two of these sequences were abundantly expressed. In chickens, the dominantly expressed MHC class I gene lies adjacent to the transporter of antigen processing ( TAP2) gene. To investigate whether this organization is also found in ducks, we cloned the gene encoding TAP2 from the cDNA library. PCR amplification from genomic DNA allowed us to determine that the dominantly expressed MHC class I gene was adjacent to TAP2. Furthermore, we amplified two alleles of the TAP2 gene from this duck that have significant and clustered amino acid differences that may influence the peptides transported. This organization has implications for the ability of ducks to eliminate viral pathogens.
832	15197511	cDNA cloning and genomic structure of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) MHC class I gene.	Xia C, Lin CY, Xu GX, Hu TJ, Yang TY	Immunogenetics	 2004 Jul;56(4):304-9	 doi: 101007/s00251-004-0685-y Epub 2004 Jun 8	In order to provide data for studies on disease resistance, duck MHC class I cDNA (Anpl-MHC I) was cloned from a duck cDNA library and the genome structure was investigated. Anpl-MHC I genes encoded 344-355 amino acids. The genomic organization is composed of eight exons and seven introns. Based on the genetic distance, Anpl-MHC I cDNA from six individuals can be classified into four lineages (from Anpl-UAA to Anpl-UDA). A total of 28 amino acid positions in the peptide-binding domain (PBD) showed high scores by Wu-kabat index analysis. The Anpl-MHC amino acid sequence displayed seven critical HLA-A2amino acids that bind with antigen polypeptides, and have an 83.6-88.5% amino acid homology with each lineage, a 55.2-64.6% amino-acid homology with chicken MHC class I (B-FIV21, B-FIV2, Rfp-Y), and a 40.3-42.8% homology with mammalian MHC class I. Nested PCR detected that Anpl-MHC I can be expressed in the brain, heart, kidney, intestines and bursa. Compared with the human HLA-A2 tertiary structure of the PBD, Anpl-MHC I had an insertion or deletion variation in four domains (A-D). The phlyogenetic tree appears to branch in an order consistent with accepted evolutionary pathways.
833	15185116	Cross-talk of phosphoinositide- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways in differentiating avian nasal gland cells.	Krohn M, Hildebrandt JP	J Comp Physiol B	 2004 Aug;174(6):461-70	 doi: 101007/s00360-004-0432-6 Epub 2004 Jun 8	In many bird species, the nasal glands secrete excess salt ingested with drinking water or food. In ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos), osmotic stress results in adaptive cell proliferation and differentiation in the gland. Using 'naive' nasal gland cells isolated from animals that had never ingested excess salt or 'differentiated' cells from animals fed with a 1% NaCl solution for 48 h, we investigated the allocation of metabolic energy to salt excretory processes and to other cellular activities. Activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (carbachol) or beta-adrenergic receptors (isoproterenol) in nasal gland cells resulted in a transient peak in metabolic rate followed by an elevated plateau level that was maintained throughout the activation period. Activation of cells using vasoactive intestinal peptide, however, had only marginal effects on metabolic rate. In differentiated cells, sequential stimulation with carbachol and isoproterenol resulted in additive changes in metabolic rate during the plateau phase. Naive cells, however, developed supra-additive plateau levels in metabolic rates indicating cross-talk of both signaling pathways. Using bumetanide, TEA or barium ions to block different components of the ion transport machinery necessary for salt secretion, the relative proportion of energy needed for processes related to ion transport or other cellular processes was determined. While differentiated cells in the activated state allocated virtually all metabolic energy to processes related to salt secretion, naive cells reserved a significant amount of energy for other processes, possibly sustaining cellular signaling and regulating biosynthetic mechanisms related to adaptive growth and differentiation.
834	15092913	Organochlorine contamination in bird's eggs from the Danube Delta.	Aurigi S, Focardi S, Hulea D, Renzoni A	Environ Pollut	 2000 Jul;109(1):61-7	 doi: 101016/s0269-7491(99)00228-6	In this study we report the levels of organochlorine compounds in eggs of aquatic birds from the Danube Delta, a major European wetland. The eggs were collected in 1997 and belonged to the following species: the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the greylag goose (Anser anser), the mute swan (Cygnus olor), the coot (Fulica atra), the glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), the spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), the little egret (Egretta garzetta), the night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), the grey heron (Ardea cinerea), the great white egret (Egretta alba), the red-necked grebe (Podiceps griseus), the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), the Pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus) and the common cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) levels were higher in eggs of the little egret, the great white egret, the cormorant and the Pygmy cormorant with respect to the other species (48,399, 13,613, 12,400 and 10,417 ng/g dry wt., respectively). Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) levels were lower than 1393 ng/g dry wt. in all species while polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in the Pygmy cormorant (2565 ng/g dry wt.) were higher than in the other species. The toxicity evaluation was based on 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalent factors (TEF) and non-ortho PCB congeners contributed much more than mono-ortho PCBs in most of species. A further aim of this study was to evaluate the possible differences of organochlorine levels in bird eggs collected in the same area in 1982 and in 1997; generally speaking the levels detected in the latter period were lower than those detected in the earlier one.
835	15077686	Assessment of erythrocyte morphologic abnormalities in mallards with experimentally induced zinc toxicosis.	Christopher MM, Shooshtari MP, Levengood JM	Am J Vet Res	 2004 Apr;65(4):440-6	 doi: 102460/ajvr200465440	OBJECTIVE: To describe and quantify morphologic abnormalities in RBCs of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with experimentally induced zinc toxicosis. ANIMALS: 120 female mallards. PROCEDURE: Farm-raised mallards (6 to 8 months old) were used in the study. On day 0, 60 ducks received shot pellets orally by gavage (mean dose of zinc, 0.97 g); another 60 ducks underwent the same procedure without administration of pellets. On day 15, Romanowsky-stained blood smears were prepared from 53 control and 45 zinc-treated ducks (smears were examined retrospectively). In each smear, 200 RBCs were examined and numbers of erythrocytes with abnormal size, shape, or color were expressed as a percentage. Results were compared with PCV values and zinc dose. RESULTS: Mean PCV value was lower in all zinc-treated ducks, compared with control ducks, and was lower in zinc-treated ducks that died or were euthanatized before day 30 because of severe clinical disease, compared with those that survived. Zinc-treated ducks that survived had a high percentage of polychromatophilic RBCs, and those that that died before day 30 had high percentages of hypochromic RBCs, fusiform RBCs, and RBC nuclear abnormalities. There was no correlation between PCV value or RBC morphologic abnormalities and dose of zinc. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In ducks with severe zinc-induced hemolysis, findings indicated that functional iron deficiency may impair the effectiveness of the erythroid regenerative response and contribute to death. Erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities were consistent with mild dyserythropoiesis. These findings may be applicable to effects of other metal toxicoses and regenerative anemias in birds.
836	15043937	The ratio of full length IgY to truncated IgY in immune complexes affects macrophage phagocytosis and the acute phase response of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Humphrey BD, Calvert CC, Klasing KC	Dev Comp Immunol	 2004 Jun;28(7-8):665-72	 doi: 101016/jdci200311003	Ducks produce a full length IgY and a truncated isoform (IgYDeltaFc). IgY and IgY(DeltaFc) were isolated from ducks vaccinated against Escherichia coli and used to make E.coli-Ig immune complexes (IC). Phagocytosis of IC by duck monocytes decreased directly with the proportion of IgYDeltaFc (p<0.001). IC containing IgY:IgY(DeltaFc) at ratios of 100:0, 50:50, 0:100, and 0:0 (E. coli alone) were injected intravenously into naive mallard ducks. At 24 h after injection, plasma hemopexin levels were higher in ducks given either the 0:100 ratio or the 100:0 ratio than those given 50:50 or E. coli alone (p<0.005) Liver IL-1beta mRNA levels followed a similar pattern. Splenic IL-1beta mRNA decreased markedly as the proportion of IgY(DeltaFc) increased (p<0.01) Thus, IgY(DeltaFc) may shift the response to IC from the spleen to the liver as infections progress from acute to chronic.
837	15030199	Quantitation of mule duck in goose foie gras using TaqMan real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction.	Rodriguez MA, Garcia T, Gonzalez I, Asensio L, Hernandez PE, Martin R	J Agric Food Chem	 2004 Mar 24;52(6):1478-83	 doi: 101021/jf035240n	A real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method has been developed for the quantitation of mule duck (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina moschata) in binary duck/goose foie gras mixtures. The method combines the use of real-time PCR with duck-specific and endogenous control "duck + goose" primers to measure duck content and total foie gras content, respectively. Both PCR systems (duck-specific and duck + goose) were designed on the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA). The duck-specific system amplifies a 96 bp fragment from duck DNA, whereas the duck + goose system amplifies a 120 bp fragment from duck and goose DNA. The method measures PCR product accumulation through a FAM-labeled fluorogenic probe (TaqMan). The C(t) (threshold cycle) values obtained from the duck + goose system are used to normalize the ones obtained from the duck-specific system. Analysis of experimental duck/goose foie gras binary mixtures demonstrated the suitability of the assay for the detection and quantitation of duck in the range of 1-25%. This genetic marker can be very useful to avoid mislabeling or fraudulent species substitution of goose by duck in foie gras.
838	15017285	Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and other strongly beta-haemolytic and indole-positive spirochaetes isolated from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Jansson DS, Johansson KE, Olofsson T, Rasback T, Vagsholm I, Pettersson B, Gunnarsson A, Fellstrom C	J Med Microbiol	 2004 Apr;53(Pt 4):293-300	 doi: 101099/jmm005488-0	The aims of the current study were to collect intestinal spirochaetes (genus Brachyspira) from farmed and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and to identify and classify those isolates that phenotypically resembled Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, an enteric pathogen of pigs. The isolation rate of Brachyspira spp. was high from both farmed (93 %) and wild mallards (78 %). In wild mallards, it appeared that Brachyspira spp. were more likely to be found in migratory birds (multivariate analysis: RR = 1.8, 95 % CI 1.1-3.1) than in mallards sampled in a public park. Pure cultures of putative B. hyodysenteriae were obtained from 22 birds. All five isolates from farmed mallards and ten randomly selected isolates with this phenotype were used for further studies. All isolates from farmed mallards and two of the isolates from wild mallards were PCR-positive for the tlyA gene of B. hyodysenteriae. Two isolates from farmed mallards were selected for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. These isolates clustered with the type and reference strains of B. hyodysenteriae. 16S rDNA sequence analysis performed on 11 of the strains showed that they were all closely related to each other and to the B. hyodysenteriae-Brachyspira intermedia cluster. Three of the mallard isolates had 16S rDNA sequences that were identical to those of B. hyodysenteriae strains R1 and NIV-1 previously isolated from common rheas (Rhea americana). To conclude, the isolates from farmed mallards and two isolates from wild mallards were classified as B. hyodysenteriae based on the fact that they could not be differentiated by any of the applied methods from type, reference and field strains of B. hyodysenteriae. The remaining isolates could not be assigned irrefutably to any of the presently recognized Brachyspira species. These results point to a broader host spectrum of B. hyodysenteriae than is generally recognized, and to the presence in mallards of strongly beta-haemolytic and indole-producing spirochaetes that possess many, but not all, of the currently recognized characteristics of B. hyodysenteriae.
839	15016504	Using the Mallard to biomonitor heavy metal contamination of wetlands in north-western Poland.	Kalisinska E, Salicki W, Myslek P, Kavetska KM, Jackowski A	Sci Total Environ	 2004 Mar 29;320(2-3):145-61	 doi: 101016/jscitotenv200308014	Contents of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, nickel, lead and cadmium were determined in the brain, pectoral muscle, kidney, liver and bones of the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), a cosmopolitan, herbivorous duck species. Both immature (im; in the first year of life) and older (adult, ad) ducks were studied. The birds originated from wetlands in two areas in north-western Poland, one located in the Slonsk waterfowl reserve (n = 32 im + 24 ad) and the other near the city of Szczecin (n = 21 im + 21 ad). There were numerous significant age-dependent differences in the metal contents of the organs of the Mallards obtained from near Szczecin (Sz) and/or Slonsk (S). Copper contents in the brain (Sz and S), muscles (Sz) and kidneys (Sz) as well as cadmium contents in the liver (Sz, S), kidneys (Sz, S) and muscles (S) were observed to increase with age. Between-area differences in metal contents of individual organs were recorded as well. The S Mallard showed higher contents of iron and copper (in muscles, liver and kidneys), zinc (in liver and kidneys) and cadmium (in muscles, liver and kidneys), while the Sz ducks revealed higher contents of manganese and lead (in brain and bones). The differences observed may be related to the habitat specificity: the Sl-onsk reserve is periodically flooded by the River Odra (Oder) waters that carry pollutants from a copper mining area 250 km away. On the other hand, the mid-field ponds near Szczecin are affected by pollutants, including those that are manganese-rich, generated by agriculture and traffic.
840	14972586	Whole-bird models for the magnetic cleansing of oiled feathers.	Orbell JD, Ngeh LN, Bigger SW, Zabinskas M, Zheng M, Healy M, Jessop R, Dann P	Mar Pollut Bull	 2004 Feb;48(3-4):336-40	 doi: 101016/jmarpolbul200308012	Iron powder, a promising dry-cleansing agent for oiled feathers where both the contaminant and the cleansing agent may be harvested magnetically, has been tested on the plumage of whole-bird models. The breast and back plumage of Mallard Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) carcasses were patch-contaminated with commercial-grade engine oil, three different crude oils, and an oil/seawater emulsion. The plumage was then subjected to a magnetic cleansing protocol. The contaminant removal was assessed gravimetrically and was found to reflect the outcomes for a previously reported in vitro study using feather clusters. Between 92-98% of the contaminants, and effectively all of the cleansing agent, were removed from the feathers.
841	14768889	Mercury accumulation and loss in mallard eggs.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ	Environ Toxicol Chem	 2004 Jan;23(1):222-4	 doi: 101897/03-111	Female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed diets containing 5, 10, or 20 ppm mercury as methylmercury chloride. One egg was collected from each bird before the start of the mercury diets and 15 eggs were collected from each bird while it was being fed mercury. The mercury diets were then replaced by uncontaminated diets, and each female was allowed to lay 29 more eggs. Mercury levels in eggs rose to about 7, 18, and 35 ppm wet-weight in females fed 5, 10, or 20 ppm mercury, respectively. Mercury levels fell to about 0.16, 0.80, and 1.7 ppm in the last egg laid by birds that had earlier been fed 5, 10, or 20 ppm mercury, respectively. Higher concentrations of mercury were found in egg albumen than in yolk, and between 95 and 100% of the mercury in the eggs was in the form of methylmercury.
842	14676018	Pancreatitis in wild zinc-poisoned waterfowl.	Sileo L, Nelson Beyer W, Mateo R	Avian Pathol	 2003 Dec;32(6):655-60	 doi: 101080/03079450310001636246	Four waterfowl were collected in the Tri-State Mining District (Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, USA), an area known to be contaminated with lead, cadmium and zinc (Zn). They were part of a larger group of 20 waterfowl collected to determine the exposure of birds to metal contamination at the site. The four waterfowl (three Branta canadensis, one Anas platyrhynchos) had mild to severe degenerative abnormalities of the exocrine pancreas, as well as tissue (pancreas, liver) concentrations of Zn that were considered toxic. The mildest condition was characterized by generalized atrophy of exocrine cells that exhibited cytoplasmic vacuoles and a relative lack of zymogen. The most severe condition was characterized by acini with distended lumens and hyperplastic exocrine tissue that completely lacked zymogen; these acini were widely separated by immature fibrous tissue. Because the lesions were nearly identical to the lesions reported in chickens and captive waterfowl that had been poisoned with ingested Zn, and because the concentrations of Zn in the pancreas and liver of the four birds were consistent with the concentrations measured in Zn-poisoned birds, we concluded that these waterfowl were poisoned by Zn. This may be the first reported case of zinc poisoning in free-ranging wild birds poisoned by environmental Zn.
843	14663159	The mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus of the duck: development and apoptosis.	Petrosino G, Lalatta Costerbosa G, Barazzoni AM, Grandis A, Clavenzani P, Bortolami R	Cells Tissues Organs	 2003;175(3):165-74	 doi: 101159/000074632	The normal development of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MesV) of the white Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was studied from the 9th day of incubation until hatching and during adulthood. In the early days of embryonic development, neurons are present in the posterior commissure and in the mesenchymal tissue outside the leptomeninges in addition to those in the tectal commissure (TC) and in the optic tectum. Following the internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, a massive loss of neurons in the MesV starts in the 11-day embryo and continues until the 15th day of incubation. On the 16th day, the nucleus consists of a numerically larger medial division located in the TC and a smaller lateral division within the stratum griseum periventriculare as is found in the adult animal. The programmed cell death occurring in the MesV is discussed herein and correlated with the analogous apoptotic phenomena observed in the trigeminal motor nucleus.
844	14658340	Low genetic differentiation and close evolutionary connection between Anas platyrhynchos and Anas poecilorhyncha: data from RAPD-PCR analysis	Kulikova IV, Chelomina GN, Zhuravlev IuN	Genetika	 2003 Oct;39(10):1353-62		Using RAPD-PCR, we examined genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships in two groups of river ducks: Anas platyrhynchos, A. poecilorhyncha, A. strepera and A. crecca, A. formosa, A. querquedula. Molecular taxon-specific markers were found for teals (A. crecca, A. formosa, A. querquedula) and gadwall (A. strepera). Each of the species examined was shown to exhibit high genetic diversity. The mean levels of intraspecific genetic polymorphism in the groups of mallards (P = 77%) and teals (P = 74.5%) were approximately equal whereas the mean interspecific genetic distances in teals were significantly higher than in mallards (D = 0.432 and D = 0.336, respectively). The levels of interspecific genetic differentiation in the species groups were also different. The genetic distances between the teal species and between gadwall and mallards were equal to 0.668-0.971 while the genetic distance between mallard A. platyrhynchos and spot-billed duck A. poecilorhyncha was 0.401, which slightly exceeds the intraspecific values for mallards (0.356-0.377). The RAPD patterns for this species pair showed high variability and a lack of fixed differences. This was adequately reflected on both intra- and interspecific differences and on phylogenetic constructions in which the morphological species did not form their own clusters but were intermixed. In contrast to mallards, the other species, which showed high genetic variability, were reliably separated in phenogenetic and phylogenetic reconstructions. The possible explanations of the low genetic differentiation of A. platyrhynchos and A. poecilorhyncha are discussed.
845	14638295	Effects of the mosquito larvicide GB-1111 on bird eggs.	Hoffman DJ, Albers PH, Melancon MJ, Miles AK	Environ Pollut	 2004;127(3):353-8	 doi: 101016/jenvpol200308021	Golden Bear Oil (GB-1111; legal trade name for GB-1313) is a petroleum distillate used in the United States and other countries as a mosquito larvicide. As part of an evaluation of the potential effects of GB-1111 on birds, fertile eggs of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) were incubated in the laboratory, and treated on day 4 of incubation with external applications equivalent to either 0, 1/3, 1, 3 or 10 times the maximum rate (X) of 47 l/ha (5 gal/A) of field application of GB-1111. Hatching success was significantly reduced in mallards treated at 3 and 10 times the maximum field application, with a calculated approximate LD50 of 1.9 times the maximum field application. Most mortality occurred within a week of treatment. Hepatic P450-associated monooxygenase activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase; EROD) was negatively related to dose. In the 3X group there was a significant increase in the concentration of hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) but a decrease in protein-bound thiols (PBSH). Hatching success of bobwhite was marginally reduced at the highest level of treatment (10X). Other effects at this level in bobwhite included a significant increase in incidence of abnormal embryos or hatchlings, lower body and liver weights, and a two-fold increase in hepatic microsomal EROD activity in hatchlings. The recommended maximum rate of field application of GB-1111 is unlikely to impair the survival or development of bobwhite embryos but is potentially toxic to mallard embryos under conditions of larvicide drift or spray overlap.
846	14575079	Avian influenza viruses in Minnesota ducks during 1998-2000.	Hanson BA, Stallknecht DE, Swayne DE, Lewis LA, Senne DA	Avian Dis	 2003;47(3 Suppl):867-71	 doi: 101637/0005-2086-47s3867	Although wild ducks are known to be a major reservoir for avian influenza viruses (AIV), there are few recent published reports of surveillance directed at this group. Predominant AIV hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes reported in previous studies of ducks in North America include H3, H4, and H6, with the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes not well represented in these host populations. The objective of this study was to determine whether these subtype patterns have persisted. Each September from 1998 to 2000, cloacal swabs were collected from wild ducks banded in Roseau and Marshall counties, MN. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were sampled all years, and northern pintails (A. acuta) were sampled only in 1999. Influenza viruses were isolated from 11%, 14%, and 8% of birds during 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Prevalence, as expected, was highest in juveniles, ranging from 11% to 23% in mallards. Viruses representative of the HA subtypes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were isolated. Viruses in the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes, which are associated with high-pathogenicity influenza in poultry or recent infections in humans, were not uncommon, and each of these subtypes was isolated in 2 out of the 3 years of surveillance.
847	14567235	Failure to transmit avian vacuolar myelinopathy to mallard ducks.	Larsen RS, Nutter FB, Augspurger T, Rocke TE, Thomas NJ, Stoskopf MK	J Wildl Dis	 2003 Jul;39(3):707-11	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-393707	Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) is a neurologic disease that has been diagnosed in free-ranging birds in the southeastern United States. Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leuocephalus), American coots (Fulica americana), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) have been affected. Previous investigations have not determined the etiology of this disease. In November and December 2002, we attempted to induce AVM in game-farmed mallards through four, 7-day exposure trials. Mallards were housed in six groups of eight, with two of these groups serving as controls. One group was housed with AVM-affected coots; one group was tube fed daily with water from the lake where affected coots were captured; one group was tube fed daily with aquatic vegetation (Hydrilla verticillata) from the same lake; and another group was tube fed daily with sediment from the lake. No ducks exhibited clinical neurologic abnormalities consistent with AVM and no evidence of AVM was present at histopathologic examination of brain tissue. Although limitations in sample size, quantity of individual doses, frequency of dose administration, duration of exposure, and timing of these trials restrict the interpretation of the findings, AVM was not readily transmitted by direct contact, water, hydrilla, or sediment in this investigation.
848	14567226	Acute toxicity of lead, steel, and an iron-tungsten-nickel shot to mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Brewer L, Fairbrother A, Clark J, Amick D	J Wildl Dis	 2003 Jul;39(3):638-48	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-393638	Twenty mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of both sexes were dosed by oral gavage with Heavi-Shot (H-S; Environ-Metal, Inc., Sweet Home, Oregon, USA) pellets, 20 with steel shot, and 10 with lead (Pb) pellets, all of equal size. All pellets were fired from a shotgun into an absorbent material, retrieved, and weighed prior to introduction into the ducks. Birds were fed whole kernel corn and grit and observed for signs of toxicity for 30 days following dosing. Hevi-Shot pellets lost an average of 6.2% of their mass and steel shot pellets lost 57% of their mass in the birds' gizzards. Almost all (90%) of the Pb shot dosed birds died before the end of the study, while no mortality was observed in the steel or H-S dosed groups. Even though total food consumption differed between the H-S and steel shot groups, mean bird weight change was not different. There were no significant morphologic or histopathologic abnormalities of the liver and kidney in the H-S and steel shot groups. Results indicated that mallards dosed orally with eight No. 4 H-S pellets were not adversely affected over a 30-day period, and that H-S provides another environmentally safe nontoxic shot for use in waterfowl hunting.
849	14562893	Pasteurella multocida-associated sinusitis in khaki Campbell ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Songserm T, Viriyarampa AS, Sae-Heng N, Chamsingh W, Bootdee O, Pathanasophon P	Avian Dis	 2003 Jul-Sep;47(3):649-55	 doi: 101637/7000	Pasteurella multocida group B, serotype 3, was isolated from sinusitis-affected khaki Campbell ducks. To study the role of P. multocida in sinusitis, commercial khaki Campbell ducks were experimentally infected with P. multocida alone or combined with Escherichia coli. In Expt. 1, experimental ducks were infected with P. multocida intranasally or ocularly. A comparison was done by intranasal inoculation with pooled nasal discharge from the affected ducks or phosphate-buffered saline. The ducks intranasally inoculated with the nasal discharge or P. multocida showed sinusitis. In Expt. 2, E. coli alone or a combination of P. multocida and E. coli was intranasally inoculated into experimental ducks. The ducks intranasally inoculated with the combination of P. multocida and E. coli had sinusitis, the same as found in the field but less severe than that of the field cases. Pasteurella multocida was already present in litter/floor of duck farms. We concluded that P. multocida played a role in induction of sinusitis. However, the sinusitis in ducks may be initiated by poor management, especially in the brooding period of ducks.
850	14511579	Detection of West Nile Virus infection in birds in the United States by blocking ELISA and immunohistochemistry.	Jozan M, Evans R, McLean R, Hall R, Tangredi B, Reed L, Scott J	Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis	 2003 Fall;3(3):99-110	 doi: 101089/153036603768395799	A blocking ELISA targeting an immunodominant West Nile epitope on the West Nile Virus NS1 protein was assessed for the detection of West Nile-specific antibodies in blood samples collected from 584 sentinel chickens and 238 wild birds collected in New Jersey from May-December 2000. Ten mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) experimentally infected with West Nile virus and six uninfected controls were also tested. The ELISA proved specific in detecting WNV antibodies in 9/10 chickens and 4/4 wild birds previously confirmed as positive by Plaque Reduction Neutralization test (PRNT) at the Center for Disease Control, Division of Vector Borne Diseases, Fort Collins, CO, USA (CDC). Nine out of the ten experimentally infected mallard ducks also tested positive for WN antibodies in the blocking ELISA, while 6/6 uninfected controls did not. Additionally, 1705 wild birds, collected in New Jersey from December 2000-November 2001 and Long Island, New York between November 1999 and August 2001 were also tested for WN antibodies by the blocking ELISA. These tests identified 30 positive specimens, 12 of which had formalin-fixed tissues available to allow detection of WN specific viral antigen in various tissues by WNV-specific immunohistochemistry. Our results indicate that rapid and specific detection of antibodies to WN virus in sera from a range of avian species by blocking ELISA is an effective strategy for WN Virus surveillance in avian hosts. In combination with detection of WN-specific antigens in tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the blocking ELISA will also be useful for confirming WN infection in diseased birds.
851	12965190	Relation of fatty acid composition in lead-exposed mallards to fat mobilization, lipid peroxidation and alkaline phosphatase activity.	Mateo R, Beyer WN, Spann JW, Hoffman DJ	Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol	 2003 Aug;135(4):451-8	 doi: 101016/s1532-0456(03)00148-0	The increase of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in animal tissues has been proposed as a mechanism of lead (Pb) poisoning through lipid peroxidation or altered eicosanoids metabolism. We have studied fatty acid (FA) composition in liver and brain of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) feeding for 3 weeks on diets containing combinations of low or high levels of vitamin E (20 or 200 UI/kg) and Pb (0 or 2 g/kg). Saturated FA, n-6 PUFA and total concentrations of FA were higher in livers of Pb-exposed mallards, but not in their brains. The percentage of n-6 PUFA in liver and brain was slightly higher in Pb-exposed mallards. The increase of n-6 PUFA in liver was associated with decreased triglycerides and increased cholesterol in plasma, thus could be in part attributed to feed refusal and fat mobilization. The hepatic ratios between adrenic acid (22:4 n-6) and arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) or between adrenic acid and linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) were higher in Pb exposed birds, supporting the existing hypothesis of increased fatty acid elongation by Pb. Among the possible consequences of increased n-6 PUFA concentration in tissues, we found increased lipid peroxidation in liver without important histopathological changes, and decreased plasma alkaline phosphatase activity that may reflect altered bone metabolism in birds.
852	12928896	Topography and neurochemistry of the enteric ganglia in the proventriculus of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Mirabella N, Squillacioti C, Genovese A, Germano G, Paino G	Anat Embryol (Berl)	 2003 Sep;207(2):101-8	 doi: 101007/s00429-003-0342-5 Epub 2003 Aug 20	The topographical distribution of the enteric ganglia has been investigated in the proventriculus of the duck using protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) immunohistochemistry. Myenteric ganglia were usually located between the outer longitudinal and the inner circular muscle layer. Submucous ganglia were sparsely distributed and seemed to be substituted by ganglia located in the tunica mucosa. The neurochemical profile of proventricular ganglion cells was also investigated using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced-diaphorase (NADPH-d)-histochemistry and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP)/galanin (Gal) double-labelling immunohistochemistry. The majority of mucosal ganglion cells were shown to contain the NADPH-d enzyme and both the investigated peptides. These findings provide evidence for the presence of a mucosal ganglionated plexus in the glandular stomach of birds. Moreover, the neurochemical characteristics of this plexus suggest that it plays an important role in regulating several mucosal functions and, in particular, the production and the composition of the gastric juice.

Augspurger T, Fischer JR, Thomas NJ, Sileo L, Brannian RE, Miller KJ, Rocke TE	J Wildl Dis	 2003 Apr;39(2):412-7	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-392412	Vacuolar myelinopathy was confirmed by light and electron microscopic examination of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris), and buffleheads (Bucephala albeola) collected during an epizootic at Lake Surf in central North Carolina (USA) between November 1998 and February 1999. Clinical signs of affected birds were consistent with central nervous system impairment of motor function (incoordination, abnormal movement and posture, weakness, paralysis). This is the first report of this disease in wild waterfowl (Anseriformes).
854	12909708	Comparison of renal and salt gland function in three species of wild ducks.	Bennett DC, Hughes MR	J Exp Biol	 2003 Sep;206(Pt 18):3273-84	 doi: 101242/jeb00551	Three processes central to osmoregulation of marine birds were compared in three species of ducks that differ in habitat affinity, diet and saline tolerance. These processes are filtration of Na+ and water from the plasma by the kidneys, their reabsorption along the renal tubules, and secretion by the salt glands. Barrow's goldeneyes Bucephala islandica, the most marine species, have the highest rates for all three processes and only this species can secrete all the infused salt via the salt glands. Rates of all three processes are lower in mallards Anas platyrhynchos, the most freshwater species. Following saline acclimation, mallards could excrete all the infused Na+ by a combined Na+ excretion of the kidneys and salt glands. Canvasbacks Aythya valisineria, despite being more saline tolerant than mallards, are unable to excrete all the infused Na+. They produce a large volume of urine (like mallards) that has a low [Na+] (like goldeneyes). Salt gland secretion Na+ concentration did not differ among the three species, but only goldeneyes secrete at a rate sufficient to eliminate all infused Na+ via the salt glands. Differences in saline tolerance of these ducks species cannot be fully explained by differences in their filtration, reabsorption and secretion of Na+ and water, suggesting that the intestinal tract plays an important role.
855	12892758	Differential channelling of liver lipids in relation to susceptibility to hepatic steatosis in two species of ducks.	Hermier D, Guy G, Guillaumin S, Davail S, Andre JM, Hoo-Paris R	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 2003 Aug;135(4):663-75	 doi: 101016/s1096-4959(03)00146-5	In the human, hepatic steatosis can be associated with an imbalance between synthesis, secretion and storage of hepatic lipids, and exhibits a genetic susceptibility. The effect of overfeeding on hepatic lipid channelling was investigated in two genotypes of ducks that differ in their susceptibility to fatty liver, i.e. the common duck, Anas platyrhynchos, and the Muscovy duck, Cairina moschata. Before overfeeeding, the Muscovy duck exhibited a lower subcutaneous adiposity and a higher muscular development, whereas hepatic composition was similar in both genotypes (>5% lipids and triglycerides accounting for 6-10% lipids). In the plasma lipoprotein profile, HDL predominated (5.5-7.8 g/l) over VLDL (0.09-0.25 g/l) and LDL (0.65-1.06 g/l). All lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were lower in the Muscovy duck. In response to overfeeding, the Muscovy duck exhibited a higher degree of hepatic steatosis (62 vs. 50% lipids), and a lower increase in adiposity and in the concentration of plasma triglycerides (6-fold vs. 10-fold) and VLDL (23-fold vs. 34-fold). Thus, certain genotypes may be more responsive to the dietary induction of fatty liver because of a less efficient channelling of hepatic lipids towards secretion into plasma and adipose storage, and the duck may represent a suitable model in which to study the development of hepatic steatosis and its pathogenesis.
856	12794672	Establishment of the fatty acid profile of the brain of the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at hatch: effects of a yolk that is naturally rich in n-3 polyunsaturates.	Speake BK, Decrock F, Surai PF, Wood NA, Groscolas R	Physiol Biochem Zool	 2003 Mar-Apr;76(2):187-95	 doi: 101086/367952	Because the yolk lipids of the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) contain the highest concentrations of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids yet reported for an avian species, the consequences for the establishment of the brain's fatty acid profile in the embryo were investigated. To place the results in context, the fatty acid compositions of yolk lipid and brain phospholipid of the king penguin were compared with those from three other species of free-living birds. The proportions of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3; DHA) in the total lipid of the initial yolks for the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), and king penguin were (% w/w of fatty acids) 1.0+/-0.1, 1.9+/-0.2, 3.3+/-0.1, and 5.9+/-0.2, respectively. The respective concentrations of DHA (% w/w of phospholipid fatty acids) in brains of the newly hatched chicks of these same species were 18.5+/-0.2, 19.6+/-0.7, 16.9+/-0.4, and 17.6+/-0.1. Thus, the natural interspecies diversity in yolk fatty acid profiles does not necessarily produce major differences in the DHA content of the developing brain. Only about 1% of the amount of DHA initially present in the yolk was recovered in the brain of the penguin at hatch. There was no preferential uptake of DHA from the yolk during development of the king penguin.
857	12790425	Pharmacodynamics of flunixin and ketoprofen in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Machin KL, Tellier LA, Lair S, Livingston A	J Zoo Wildl Med	 2001 Jun;32(2):222-9	 doi: 101638/1042-7260(2001)032[0222:POFAKI]20CO;2	Flunixin (FLX) and ketoprofen (KET) are potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used to alleviate pain and decrease inflammation. These drugs block access of arachidonic acid to its binding site on the cyclooxygenase enzyme, thus preventing conversion to thromboxane A2 and subsequent degradation to thromboxane B2 (TBX). Consequently, plasma TBX may be used to estimate duration of NSAID action. Sixteen adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: control (n = 4), FLX 5 mg/kg (n = 6), or KET 5 mg/kg (n = 6). Blood samples were taken 1 hr prior to and just before (0 hr) injection and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hr after injection. Plasma samples were analyzed for corticosterone and TBX. The feces were tested for the presence of hemoglobin and the ducks were euthanized for complete necropsy at the end of the study. Samples of muscle, kidney, liver, proventriculus, and intestine were taken for histologic analysis. Thromboxane was suppressed significantly in all birds following administration of either FLX or KET for 4 hr and decreased for approximately 12 hr compared with baseline samples (-1 and 0 hr). In the control group, TBX gradually declined over time. None of the ducks showed evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, but the FLX group had muscle necrosis present at injection sites. FLX and KET likely exert pharmacological effects for at least 12 h. Although degree of TBX inhibition cannot be correlated absolutely with degree of analgesia or anti-inflammatory effects, it is possible that these effects are present during this time. This work suggests that FLX and KET can potentially be used as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents in waterfowl. However, because of muscle necrosis at the injection site, we do not recommend parenteral use of FLX in ducks.
858	12743723	Heat increment of feeding and thermal substitution in mallard ducks feeding voluntarily on grain.	Kaseloo PA, Lovvorn JR	J Comp Physiol B	 2003 Apr;173(3):207-13	 doi: 101007/s00360-002-0321-9 Epub 2003 Mar 4	The heat increment of feeding (HIF), including heat from digestion, assimilation, and nutrient interconversion, may substitute for thermogenesis and reduce thermoregulation costs. HIF and its substitution have been measured mainly in animals fed single large meals with high protein content, but many species such as some dabbling ducks (Anatini) feed more continuously in intermittent small meals with low protein content. We measured HIF in seven mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) eating mixed grain (corn, wheat, milo) ad libitum while floating on water at 23 degrees C (thermoneutral) and 8 degrees C. HIF was calculated as the difference in oxygen consumption between fed and fasted birds, correcting for costs of behavior, heat storage (change in body temperature), and heating food. Substitution occurred if HIF was lower at 8 degrees C than at 23 degrees C. Food intake of mallards averaged 83% of that required for maintenance (zero energy balance) at 23 degrees C, and 68% of maintenance at 8 degrees C. Mean HIF (+/-1 SE) was 1.59+/-0.61 l O(2) at 23 degrees C and 1.48+/-0.68 l O(2) at 8 degrees C. These values were 4.9% and 3.9% of metabolizable energy intake, consistent with values expected for grain. HIF did not differ between temperatures (ANCOVA, birds as blocks, intake as covariate, P=0.51), indicating no measurable substitution at these intake levels in intermittent meals. For these large birds that feed on low-protein foods in intermittent small meals, the ecological importance of HIF substitution appears negligible during periods when food intake is below that required for energy balance.
859	12737224	Inheritance of reproductive traits of female common ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in pure breeding and in inter-generic crossbreeding with muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata).	Brun JM, Larzul C	Br Poult Sci	 2003 Mar;44(1):40-5	 doi: 101080/0007166031000085445a	1. Genetic parameters of reproductive traits were estimated in a population of common duck, in purebreeding and crossbreeding (with Muscovies) insemination systems. A total of 989 females were studied over three generations as well as 4025 purebred offspring and 4,125 male mule offspring. 2. Traits studied were age at first egg, total number of eggs laid until the age of 48 weeks, fertility and hatchability rates in pure and crossbreds, weight at 6 and 30 weeks of age, average egg weight and body weight of the male mule ducks at 6 weeks of age. 3. Heritability estimates were found to be medium range for reproductive traits (0.15 to 0.47). Heritability value for fertility or hatchability in crossbreds was twice as high as in purebreds (0.32 vs 0.15 for fertility; 0.36 vs 0.16 for hatchability). 4. Fertility in purebreeding and in crossbreeding were two different traits (r(g) = 0.49) while hatchability displayed a high genetic correlation between breeding systems (r(g) = 0.88). 5. Genetic correlations with number of hatched mule ducks were medium or high and favourable. Genetic correlations between reproductive traits and weights were low (< 0.36), the most related trait being the body weight of the male mule duck at 6 weeks of age.
860	12712597	Effects of cadmium ingestion on plasma and osmoregulatory hormone concentrations in male and female Pekin ducks.	Hughes MR, Bennett DC, Gray DA, Sharp PJ, Scheuhammer AM, Elliott JE	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2003 Mar 28;66(6):565-79	 doi: 101080/15287390306354	Effects of ingested cadmium (Cd) on body mass and plasma, urine, salt-gland secretion, and osmoregulatory hormone concentrations were assessed in male and female Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, acclimated to 450 mM NaCl over 6 wk and then held an additional 13 wk on 300 mM NaCl (prolonged saline exposure). Groups of six birds ate diets containing 0 (control), 50 (low-Cd diet), or 300 (high Cd diet) micrograms Cd/g food. Ducks that ingested Cd, especially females, lost body mass. Cadmium ingestion did not affect salt-gland secretion concentration. Control males had higher plasma osmolality and lower relative plasma volume. These increased in both sexes during saline acclimation. The high-Cd diet suppressed the increase in plasma osmolality in both sexes, but a rise in relative plasma volume occurred only in females. Following prolonged exposure to saline, plasma osmolality and relative plasma volume were reduced in control ducks but further elevated in ducks on the high-Cd diet. Cadmium ingestion suppressed the increase in urine osmolality that occurred in control ducks during saline acclimation. Neither saline acclimation nor Cd ingestion affected plasma concentrations of arginine vasotocin or prolactin. Arginine vasotocin was not correlated with plasma osmolality; prolactin was negatively correlated with plasma osmolality, but only in males. Cadmium suppressed the increase in angiotensin II that occurred at higher salinities in control and low-Cd males. This study examined the effects of gradually increasing body cadmium content on osmotic homeostasis. Cadmium affected plasma and urine, but not salt-gland secretion, concentrations and some of these responses were sexually disparate. Cadmium did not affect osmoregulatory hormones (arginine vasotocin and prolactin) by which observed changes in plasma concentration might have been influenced.
861	12685076	Comparison of methods to detect Pasteurella multocida in carrier waterfowl.	Samuel MD, Shadduck DJ, Goldberg DR, Johnson WP	J Wildl Dis	 2003 Jan;39(1):125-35	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-391125	We conducted laboratory challenge trials using mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) to compare methods for detecting carriers of Pasteurella multocida, the bacterium that causes avian cholera, in wild birds. Birds that survived the initial infection were euthanized at 2-4 wk intervals up to 14 wk post challenge. Isolates of P. multocida were obtained at necropsy from 23% of the birds that survived initial infection. We found that swab samples (oral, cloacal, nasal, eye, and leg joint) were most effective for detecting carrier birds up to 14 wk post infection. No detectable differences in isolation were observed for samples stored in either 10% dimethysulfoxide or brain heart infusion broth. The frequency of detecting carriers in our challenge trials appeared to be related to mortality rates observed during the trial, but was not related to a number of other factors including time after challenge, time delays in collecting tissues postmortem, and route of infection. In our trials, there was little association between antibody levels and carrier status. We concluded that swabs samples collected from recently dead birds, stored in liquid nitrogen, and processed using selective broth provide a feasible field method for detecting P. multocida carriers in wild waterfowl.
862	12685074	An adenovirus associated with intestinal impaction and mortality of male common eiders (Somateria mollissima) in the Baltic Sea.	Hollmen TE, Franson JC, Kilpi M, Docherty DE, Myllys V	J Wildl Dis	 2003 Jan;39(1):114-20	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-391114	We examined 10 common eider (Somateria mollissima) males found dead in 1998 during a die-off in the northern Baltic Sea off the southwestern coast of Finland. We diagnosed impaction of the posterior small intestine with mucosal necrosis as the cause of death in all 10 and isolated adenoviruses from cloacal samples of six birds. The adenovirus isolates were not neutralized by reference antisera to group I, II, or III avian adenoviruses. Cloacal swabs from 22 apparently healthy eider females nesting at the mortality area were negative for viruses. An adenovirus isolated from one of the eiders caused clinical signs of illness and gastrointestinal pathology in experimentally infected mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings. These findings suggest that the adenovirus contributed to the mortality of common eider males in the Finnish archipelago.
863	12617577	Identification of goose, mule duck, chicken, turkey, and swine in foie gras by species-specific polymerase chain reaction.	Rodriguez MA, Garcia T, Gonzalez I, Asensio L, Mayoral B, Lopez-Calleja I, Hernandez PE, Martin R	J Agric Food Chem	 2003 Mar 12;51(6):1524-9	 doi: 101021/jf025784+	A specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been developed for the identification of goose (Anser anser), mule duck (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina moschata), chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), and swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) in foie gras. A forward common primer was designed on a conserved DNA sequence in the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA), and reverse primers were designed to hybridize on species-specific DNA sequences of each species considered. The different sizes of the species-specific amplicons, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, allowed clear identification of goose, mule duck, chicken, turkey, and swine in foie gras. Analysis of experimental mixtures demonstrated that the detection limit of the assay was approximately 1% for each species analyzed. This genetic marker can be very useful for the accurate identification of these species, avoiding mislabeling or fraudulent species substitution in foie gras.
864	12596366	Visceral lesions in mammals and birds exposed to agents of human cercarial dermatitis	Bayssade-Dufour Ch, Vuong PN, Rene M, Martin-Loehr C, Martins C	Bull Soc Pathol Exot	 2002 Nov;95(4):229-37		Over the past few years, the cercarial dermatitis has become a new problem of public health, obviously linked to the prolonged stay of migrant birds on our territory. This is a skin affection characterized by pruriginous and papulous eruptions caused by penetration of avian bilharzian larvae under the skin. These larvae are emitted by molluscs, mostly limneids. In aquatic birds, especially in migrating Anatidae, these larvae reach the visceral vessels, become adults in a few weeks, lay eggs, then degenerate. Corresponding miracidia contaminate new limneids. Since 1993, the total number of annual cases of cercarial dermatitis has increased from only ten to thousands in France and the affection rages in pools where limneids, migrating water birds and swimmers gather together. Fever, respiratory and/or digestive allergic symptoms appear in some cases. This clinical pattern has encouraged to undertake research on the future of these bilharzian larvae in mammals organism. A preliminary investigation on a rodent model showed that, once the skin barrier had been crossed, the schistosomulae migrated into the lungs of the host; there they survived a week and induced lesions. The goal of this study is to carry on the research, over a longer period, after exposure to cercariae, simultaneously in mammals and birds, with two species of bilharziae present in France. The selected models are the gerbil Meriones unguiculatus for mammals, and the ducks Anas platyrhynchos and Cairina moschata, for birds. 5 M. unguiculatus and 2 A. platyrhynchos were exposed to cercariae emitted by Radix auricularia; 2 gerbils and 5 A. platyryhnchos to larvae of R. peregra, 3 C. moschata to larvae emitted by two species of molluscs: 70-230 from R. auricularia and 330-585 from R. peregra. 5 gerbils died between 2 and 5 weeks after exposure, 2 gerbils sacrificed early, served as control animals for skin manifestations. Eight ducks were sacrificed between 2 and 4 weeks after; the 2 last ones, exposed several times, were sacrificed respectively 7 and 13 weeks after the first exposure. Visceral and skin samples were submitted to histological study. The control gerbils developed skin dermatitis. In ducks, R. auricularia was the vector of Trichobilharzia franki, whose selective dwelling site was the mesentery; R. peregra was the vector of an indeterminate species found in the lungs and nose. This species is called Bilharzia sp. in this study. The ducks, exposed to two kinds of larvae, displayed worms in these two main locations. In gerbils, T. franki induced lesions in the mesenteric veins and the peritoneum. Bilharzia sp. gave rise to lesions in lung arteries, pleura and liver veins. Vascular changes encompassed endothelitis and lymphocytic vasculitis, while serosa displayed mesothelial hyperplasia. The types of lesions observed in gerbils were noticed in ducks, and, according to the species of bilharzia, in the homologous viscera. Additional foreign body granulomas centred on worm's debris or their eggs, and vascular thromboses were present, too. In addition, ducks displayed lesions involving several other viscera including the intestine, the kidneys and the peripheral nerves. These changes were multiple and diffuse in C. moschata exposed to two species of bilharziae. They were observed mainly in mesenteric and intestinal vessels, pulmonary arteries and hepatic veins. In gerbils, the lesions persisted 2 to 5 weeks after exposure, but worms were not identified in the neighbouring tissues near the damaged vessels. In ducks, lesions were important between 2 and 7 weeks after exposure; they co-existed with live or dead worms, sometimes paired, with or without eggs. The hepatic lesions regressed 13 weeks, after exposure. In mammals and birds, young worms could migrate into the same visceral vessels, and stimulating formation of persistent lesions. In individuals exposed to the same cercariae, development of similar lesions would be probable.
865	12595278	CO2 transduction in avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors is critically dependent on transmembrane Na+/H+ exchange.	Hempleman SC, Adamson TP, Begay RS, Solomon IC	Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol	 2003 Jun;284(6):R1551-9	 doi: 101152/ajpregu005192002 Epub 2003 Feb 20	Avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) are vagal respiratory afferents that are inhibited by high lung Pco(2) and excited by low lung Pco(2). Previous work suggests that increased CO(2) inhibits IPC by acidifying intracellular pH (pH(i)) and that pH(i) is determined by a kinetic balance between the rate of intracellular carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed CO(2) hydration/dehydration and transmembrane extrusion of acids and/or bases by various exchangers. Here, the role of amiloride-sensitive Na(+)/H(+) exchange (NHE) in the IPC CO(2) response was tested by recording single-unit action potentials from IPC in anesthetized ducks, Anas platyrhynchos. For each of the IPC tested, blockade of the NHE using dimethyl amiloride (DMA) elicited a marked (>50%) dose-dependent decrease in mean IPC discharge (P < 0.05), suggesting that NHE is important for pH(i) regulation and CO(2) transduction in IPC. In addition, activation of the NHE using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate stimulated six of the seven IPC tested, although the overall effect was not statistically significantly (P = 0.07). Taken together, these findings suggest that CO(2) transduction in IPC is dependent on transmembrane NHE although it is likely to be much slower than carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration-dehydration of CO(2).
866	12592440	Effect of saline intake on water flux and osmotic homeostasis in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Bennett DC, Gray DA, Hughes MR	J Comp Physiol B	 2003 Feb;173(1):27-36	 doi: 101007/s00360-002-0306-8 Epub 2002 Nov 22	The physiological regulation of body water volume and concentration was evaluated in Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, slowly acclimated to increasingly saline drinking water (six equal 75 mM NaCl increments). Body mass, total body water (TBW), water flux, plasma osmolality (Osm(pl)), and ionic and osmoregulatory hormone concentrations were measured at the end of each increment. The salinity at which each variable deviates from its homeostatic set point was calculated by continuous two-phase linear regression. We hypothesized that, as drinking water salinity increases: (1) body water increases in concentration before it decreases in volume and (2) that regulating variables that help determine homeostatically set values (plasma hormone concentrations and water flux) deviate from values of freshwater ducks at lower drinking water salinities than the variables they regulate (Osm(pl), hematocrit, TBW). Osm(pl) was the first variable for which we could calculate a deviation from its homeostatically controlled value. It increases at much lower drinking water salinity than that at which TBW decreases, supporting our first hypothesis, but not our second hypothesis. We further hypothesized that, because the concentration of Pekin duck salt gland secretion is only slightly higher than that of their drinking water, they increase water flux (drinking) as salinity of drinking water increases, until the latter exceeds the secretion concentration and then they drink less. There was no change in water flux until it decreases when TBW decreases, 329 mM NaCl and 335 mM NaCl, respectively. The results do not support our hypothesis that Pekin ducks increase drinking as the salinity of their drinking water increases, but do indicate that, at tolerable salinities, Pekin ducks maintain body water volume while allowing body water osmolality to increase. At higher salinities, ducks decrease drinking and use body water to get rid of the excess salt.
867	12592439	Effect of saline acclimation on body water and sodium compartmentalization in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Bennett DC, Kojwang D, Sullivan TM, Gray DA, Hughes MR	J Comp Physiol B	 2003 Feb;173(1):21-6	 doi: 101007/s00360-002-0305-9 Epub 2002 Nov 20	The compartmentalization of body fluids was measured in individual Pekin ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos) drinking freshwater and after sequential acclimation to 300 mM NaCl and 400 mM NaCl. Total body water, extracellular fluid volume, plasma volume and exchangeable sodium pool were measured using (3)H(2)O, [(14)C]-polyethylene glycol, Evans Blue dye, and (22)Na dilution, respectively. Following acclimation to 300 mM NaCl, body mass decreased, but total body water and total exchangeable sodium pool were unaltered. Na and water were redistributed from the extracellular fluid (interstitial fluid) compartment into the intracellular fluid compartment. Following further acclimation to 400 mM NaCl, body mass, total body water and intracellular fluid volume decreased, but exchangeable sodium pool and extracellular fluid volume were unchanged. Our results suggested that, when Pekin ducks drink high but tolerable salinities, they maintain total body water, but redistribute Na(+) and water from interstitial fluid to the intracellular fluid compartment. When stressed beyond their ability to maintain total body water, they lose water from the intracellular fluid.
868	12531305	Cadmium and lead in tissues of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) using the Illinois River (USA).	Levengood JM	Environ Pollut	 2003;122(2):177-81	 doi: 101016/s0269-7491(02)00298-1	Cadmium and lead concentrations were determined in the tissues of Mallards and Wood Ducks collected from two waterfowl management areas along the Illinois River, USA, during the autumn and late winter of 1997-1998. Lead concentrations in livers of Mallards were lower than previously reported, and, along with those in a small sample of Wood Duck livers, were within background levels (<2.0 microg/g wet weight). Mean concentrations of cadmium in the kidneys of Wood Ducks utilizing the Illinois River were four times greater than in after-hatch-year Mallards, and 14 times greater than in hatch-year Mallards. Concentrations of cadmium in the kidneys of Wood Ducks were comparable with those of specimens dosed with cadmium or inhabiting contaminated areas in previous studies. Wood Ducks utilizing wetlands associated with the Illinois River, and presumably other portions of the lower Great Lakes region, may be chronically exposed to cadmium.

Rocke TE, Thomas NJ, Augspurger T, Miller K	J Wildl Dis	 2002 Oct;38(4):678-84	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-384678	Epizootic avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) was first recognized as a neurologic disease in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and American coots (Fulica americana) in Arkansas, USA in 1994 and 1996, respectively, but attempts to identify the etiology of the disease have been unsuccessful to date. Between 1998 and 2001, wing clipped sentinel birds (wild American coots and game farm mallards [Anas platyrhynchos]) were released at Lake Surf, North Carolina, a lake with recurrent outbreaks of AVM, in order to gain a better understanding of the epizootiology of the disease. As early as 5-7 days post-release, sentinel coots and mallards showed neurologic signs of disease and were confirmed with AVM upon histologic examination of their brains. Serial releases of sentinel mallards during the summer, fall, and winter of 2000-01 demonstrated that exposure to the causative agent at a threshold sufficient to manifest disease was seasonal and occurred over about a 2 mo period, during November and December. Our findings that disease onset can be very rapid (5-7 days) and that exposure to the causative agent of AVM is site-specific, seasonal (late fall to early winter), and occurs over a relatively short duration (several months) supports the hypothesis that the disease is caused by a chemical substance, most likely of natural origin.
870	12524015	Comparative pharmacokinetics of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in five bird species.	Baert K, De Backer P	Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol	 2003 Jan;134(1):25-33	 doi: 101016/s1532-0456(02)00184-9	Information on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-inflammatory drugs in birds is scarce. Choice of drug and of dosage is usually empirical, since studies of anti-inflammatory drugs are lacking. In this study, three common veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were administered intravenously to five different bird species. Sodium salicylate, flunixin and meloxicam were selected as anti-inflammatory drugs. These NSAIDs were administered intravenously to chickens (Gallus gallus), ostriches (Struthio camelus), ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and pigeons (Columba livia). Plasma concentrations of the drugs were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Most bird species exhibited rapid elimination of these drugs. Ostriches had the fastest elimination rate for all three NSAIDs, but there were some interesting species differences. Chickens had a half-life that was approximately 10-fold as long as the other bird species for flunixin. The half-life of chickens and pigeons was three-fold as long as the other bird species for meloxicam, and, for salicylic acid, the half-life in pigeons was at least three-five-fold longer than in the other bird species.

Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2003 Feb;44(2):257-64	 doi: 101007/s00244-002-2021-6	Eighty pairs of mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos) were fed an uncontaminated diet until each female had laid 15 eggs. After each female had laid her 15th egg, the pair was randomly assigned to a control diet or diets containing 5, 10, or 20 microg/g mercury as methylmercury until she had laid a second set of 15 eggs. There were 20 pairs in each group. After the second set of 15 eggs, the pair was returned to an uncontaminated diet, and the female was permitted to lay another 30 eggs. For those pairs fed the mercury diets, the even-numbered eggs were incubated and the odd-numbered eggs were saved for possible mercury analysis. Mercury in the even-numbered eggs was estimated as the average of what was in the neighboring odd-numbered eggs. Neurological signs of methylmercury poisoning were observed in ducklings that hatched from eggs containing as little as 2.3 microg/g estimated mercury on a wet-weight basis, and deformities were seen in embryos from eggs containing about 1 microg/g estimated mercury. Although embryo mortality was seen in eggs estimated to contain as little as 0.74 microg/g mercury, there were considerable differences in the sensitivity of mallard embryos, especially from different parents, with some embryos surviving as much as 30 or more microg/g mercury in the egg.

In the light of previous biomechanical and ontogenetic studies, a functional hypothesis is proposed, explaining the histological differences observed between long bones; laminar bone tissue, mainly found in the wing bones, may be a biomechanical adaptation to torsional loads caused by flapping flight.
873	12481873	DDT homologues and PCBs in eggs of great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) from Lake Maggiore (Italy).	Galassi S, Saino N, Melone G, Croce V	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	 2002 Sep;53(1):163-9	 doi: 101006/eesa20022220	DDT homologues and PCBs were determined in eggs of two stationary species, great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), in three breeding areas of Lake Maggiore in 1998. As expected, much higher contamination levels of both DDTs and PCBs were found in the fish-eating great crested grebe than in the mallard. In many eggs these values exceeded the safety thresholds proposed for aquatic bird protection. However, no significant correlation could be found between the two classes of pollutants and shell thickness in great crested grebe eggs. While a DDT manufacturer was detected as the main source of DDT pollution in the Lake Maggiore environment, the reason for the surprisingly high PCB level remains unknown.
874	12427388	Selection responses for the number of fertile eggs of the Brown Tsaiya duck (Anas platyrhynchos) after a single artificial insemination with pooled Muscovy (Cairina moschata) semen.	Cheng YS, Rouvier R, Poivey JP, Tai JJ, Tai C, Huang SC	Genet Sel Evol	 2002 Sep-Oct;34(5):597-611	 doi: 101186/1297-9686-34-5-597	A seven-generation selection experiment comprising a selected (S) and a control (C) line was conducted with the objective of increasing the number of fertile eggs (F) of the Brown Tsaiya duck after a single artificial insemination (AI) with pooled Muscovy semen. Both lines consisted of about 20 males and 60 females since parents in each generation and each female duck was tested 3 times, at 26, 29 and 32 weeks of age. The fertile eggs were measured by candling at day 7 of incubation. The selection criterion in the S line was the BLUP animal model value for F. On average, 24.7% of the females and 15% of the males were selected. The direct responses to the selection for F, and correlated responses for the number of eggs set (Ie), the number of total dead embryos (M), the maximum duration of fertility (Dm) and the number of hatched mule ducklings (H) were measured by studying the differences across the generations of selection between the phenotypic value averages in the S and C lines. The predicted genetic responses were calculated by studying the differences between the S and C lines in averaged values of five traits of the BLUP animal model. The selection responses and the predicted responses showed similar trends. There was no genetic change for Ie. After seven generations of selection, the average selection responses per generation were 0.40, 0.33, 0.42, 0.41 genetic standard deviation units for F, M, Dm, and H respectively. Embryo viability was not impaired by this selection. For days 2-8 after AI, the fertility rates (F/Ie) were 89.2% and 63.8%, the hatchability rates (H/F) were 72.5% and 70.6%, and (H/Ie) were 64.7% and 45.1% in the S and C lines respectively. It was concluded that upward selection on the number of fertile eggs after a single AI with pooled Muscovy semen may be effective in ducks to increase the duration of the fertile period and the fertility and hatchability rates with AI once a week instead of twice a week.
875	12111409	Avian paramyxoviruses and influenza viruses isolated from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in New Zealand.	Stanislawek WL, Wilks CR, Meers J, Horner GW, Alexander DJ, Manvell RJ, Kattenbelt JA, Gould AR	Arch Virol	 2002 Jul;147(7):1287-302	 doi: 101007/s00705-002-0818-2	A comprehensive study using virological and serological approaches was carried out to determine the status of live healthy mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in New Zealand for infections with avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) and influenza viruses (AIV). Thirty-three viruses isolated from 321 tracheal and cloacal swabs were characterized as: 6 AIV (two H5N2 and four H4N6), 10 APMV-1 and 17 APMV-4. Of 335 sera samples tested for AIV antibodies, 109 (32.5%) sera were positive by nucleoprotein-blocking ELISA (NP-B-ELISA). Serum samples (315) were examined for antibody to APMV-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -8, -9 by the haemagglutination inhibition test. The largest number of reactions, with titres up to > or =1/64, was to APMV-1 (93.1%), followed by APMV-6 (85.1%), APMV-8 (56%), APMV-4 (51.7%), APMV-7 (47%), APMV-9 (15.9%), APMV-2 (13.3%) and APMV-3 (6.0%). All of the H5N2 isolates of AIV and the APMV-1 isolates from this and earlier New Zealand studies had low pathogenicity indices assessed by the Intravenous Pathogenicity Index (IVPI) with the result 0.00 and Intracerebral Pathogenicity Index (ICPI) with results 0.00-0.16. Partial genomic and antigenic analyses were also consistent with the isolates being non-pathogenic. Phylogenetic analysis of the 10 APMV-1 isolates showed 9 to be most similar to the reference APMV-1 strain D26/76 originally isolated in Japan and also to the Que/66 strain, which was isolated in Australia. The other isolate was very similar to a virus (MC 110/77) obtained from a shelduck in France.

Dupuy V, Nersessian B, Bakst MR	Poult Sci	 2002 Jun;81(6):860-8	 doi: 101093/ps/816860	Embryonic mortality is a significant problem plaguing the commercial duck industry worldwide. Yet, an objective means to stage development of the duck embryo is lacking. Such a staging procedure, which is described in this study, is essential for the critical and reproducible assessment of embryo development. The morphological features associated with duck embryo development are very similar to those of the chicken, although the duck embryo develops more slowly. The staging scheme presented here provides objective morphological criteria describing the embryonic development of the duck.
877	12061662	Isolation and characterization of a reovirus from common eiders (Somateria mollissima) from Finland.	Hollmen T, Franson JC, Kilpi M, Docherty DE, Hansen WR, Hario M	Avian Dis	 2002 Apr-Jun;46(2):478-84	 doi: 101637/0005-2086(2002)046[0478:IACOAR]20CO;2	Samples of brain, intestine, liver, lung, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius were collected from five common eider (Somateria mollissima) duckling carcasses during a die-off in the western Gulf of Finland (59 degrees 50'N, 23 degrees 15'E) in June 1996. No viral activity was observed in specific-pathogen-free chicken embryos inoculated with tissue suspensions, but samples of bursa of Fabricius from three birds were positive when inoculated into Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) embryo fibroblasts. The isolates were characterized as nonenveloped RNA viruses and possessed several characteristics of the genus Orthoreovirus. Virus particles were icosahedral with a mean diameter of 72 nm and were stable at pH 3.0; their genome was separated into 10 segments by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings experimentally infected with the eider reovirus showed elevated serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase enzymes and focal hemorrhages in the liver, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius. During 1997-99, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to the isolated virus ranged from 0 to 86% in 302 serum samples collected from incubating eider hens at three nesting areas along coastal Finland. The highest seroprevalence was found in Hanko in 1999, just weeks before reports of an uninvestigated mortality event resulting in the death of an estimated 98% of ducklings at that location. These findings raise the question of potential involvement of the virus in poor duckling survival and eider population declines observed in several breeding areas along coastal Finland since the mid-1980s.
878	12051984	Heterochronic detection through a function for the ontogenetic variation of bone shape.	Cubo J, Azagra D, Casinos A, Castanet J	J Theor Biol	 2002 Mar 7;215(1):57-66	 doi: 101006/jtbi20012494	Heterochrony, evolutionary modifications in the rates and/or the timing of development, is widely recognized as an important agent of evolutionary change. In this paper, we are concerned with the detection of this evolutionary mechanism through the analysis of long bone growth. For this, we provide a function sigma (t) for the ontogenetic variation of bone shape by taking the ratio of two Gompertz curves explaining, respectively, the relative contribution to long bone growth of (a) endochondral ossification and (b) periosteal ossification. The significance of the fitting of this function to empirical data was tested in Anas platyrhynchos (Anseriformes). In this function sigma (t), the time t(m) at which periosteal growth rate first equalizes endochondral growth rate was taken as the timing parameter to be compared between taxa. On the other hand, the maximum rate of ontogenetic change in bone shape (maximum slope, beta) from hatching to t(m) was taken as the rate parameter to be compared. Comparisons of these parameters between the plesiomorphic condition and the derived character state would provide evidence for hypomorphosis (earlier occurrence of t(m)), hyper-morphosis (delayed occurrence of t(m)), deceleration (smaller beta) or acceleration (higher beta). Regarding the phylogenetic context, the ancestral condition for the character of interest should be estimated to polarize the direction of the heterochronic change. We have quantified the influence of the phylogenetic history on the variation of adult bone shape in a sample of 13 species of Anseriformes and 17 species from other neornithine orders of birds by using permutational phylogenetic regressions. Phylogenetic effects are significant, and this fact allows the optimization of bone shape onto a phylogenetic tree of Anseriformes to estimate the ancestral condition for Anas platyrhynchos.
879	12047247	Cyclical reproductive changes in the non-ciliated epithelia of the epididymis of birds.	Aire TA	Anat Histol Embryol	 2002 Apr;31(2):113-8	 doi: 101046/j1439-0264200200369x	The epididymis of two species of domestic birds, the domestic fowl (Gallus domesticus), duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and of domestic and feral guinea-fowl (Numida meleagris) was studied during the three main phases of the reproductive cycle (prepuberal, sexually mature and active, and sexually mature but inactive or resting) with a view to identifying major histological and ultrastructural changes associated with and distinctive for each phase. Rete testis cells accumulated numerous variably sized lipid droplets in all birds, as well as large heterogeneous and lipofuscin-containing dense bodies in the guinea-fowl, during the resting but not in the other phases. The principal or Type III cells of the connecting and epididymal ducts exhibited profound structural changes, including, but not limited to, rarefied cytoplasm, inconspicuous and general loss of sparsely granular endoplasmic reticulum, loss of secretory vesicles in the drake, and an enhanced and conspicuous presence of lipid droplets in the guinea-fowl. The rete cells appeared to be less sensitive than the Type III cells to a reduced level or absence of lumenal androgens. These phase-dependent changes may help to prevent or minimize discrepancies in the interpretation of the normal structure of the epididymis in birds during the sexually active phase, as distinct from the other two phases and their intermediate phases.
880	12017770	Bone typology and growth rate: testing and quantifying 'Amprino's rule' in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	de Margerie E, Cubo J, Castanet J	C R Biol	 2002 Mar;325(3):221-30	 doi: 101016/s1631-0691(02)01429-4	Periosteal bone histology expresses its rate of deposition. This fundamental relationship between bone structure and growth dynamics, first assumed by Amprino many decades ago, was quantified in preliminary studies, but never statistically tested. Moreover, the precise typological characters of bone tissue linked to growth rate remained poorly known. Here, we present the first statistical analysis of 'Amprino's rule', measured on comprehensive growth series of the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos. Growth rates were assessed by fluorescent labelling. Bone typology was described according to Ricqles' typological classification. Results show that the presence and proportion of primary osteons, two consequences of bone initial porosity at the time of its deposit, are strongly related to bone growth rate. However, no significant relationship between primary osteons orientation and bone growth rate could be detected, at least for osteonal orientations (longitudinal, laminar and reticular) and growth rates values observed in mallard long bones. These results suggest that Amprino's rule holds for some major typological characters of primary compact bone tissues (i.e. primary osteons presence and proportion). However, it is irrelevant to some other characters (i.e. osteonal orientation), the meaning of which remains to be discovered.
881	12014506	Ataxia and disequilibrium in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) with intracranial lipomas.	Bartels T, Krautwald-Junghanns ME, Portmann S, Gille U, Brinkmeier J, Kummerfeld N	Vet Pathol	 2002 May;39(3):396-9	 doi: 101354/vp39-3-396	Four birds in a flock of 125 purebred Crested ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) had cerebellar signs of unknown etiology. They had radiographically evident perforations of various sizes in the parieto-occipital calvaria. Gross necropsy of euthanatized ducks revealed yellow intracranial masses in the brain of each. Histologically, these masses were intracranial lipomas consisting of univacuolated fatty tissue separated into lobules by strands of connective tissue. The masses had caused serious deformation of the rostral part of the cerebellum, leading to a nearly complete flattening of cerebellar folia, and were interpreted as the cause for the central nervous clinical signs observed. These intracranial lipomas were similar to those previously reported in other animals and humans.
882	11986388	Hypertonic fluids are secreted by medial and lateral segments in duck (Anas platyrhynchos) nasal salt glands.	Butler DG	J Physiol	 2002 May 1;540(Pt 3):1039-46	 doi: 101113/jphysiol2001016980	Indwelling catheters were used to collect fluid directly from the medial and lateral segments of duck nasal salt glands showing, for the first time, that the secretions are fully hypertonic before reaching the medial and lateral drainage ducts. Using this method it was possible to show that (a) there is a functional symmetry between the left and right salt glands, (b) the medial segment always secretes fluid at approximately twice the rate of the lateral segment and (c) fluid secreted by the medial segment has the same ionic composition but variable ion concentrations when compared with fluid from the lateral segment. A 12 % increase in post-segmental fluid osmolality was probably due to the evaporation of water from epithelial surfaces in the nasal cavities during breathing. A post-segmental outflux of Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and Cl(-) in the medial and lateral collecting ducts and/or nasal epithelium may be of adaptive significance when birds inhabit calcium- and magnesium-rich marine environments.
883	11981805	Morphological changes in the efferent ducts during the main phases of the reproductive cycle of birds.	Aire TA	J Morphol	 2002 Jul;253(1):64-75	 doi: 101002/jmor1113	The changes that take place in the efferent ducts during the major phases of the reproductive cycle of birds were studied morphologically using standard histological, morphometric, and ultrastructural methods in prepuberal, sexually mature and sexually active, and sexually mature but sexually inactive domestic fowl (Gallus domesticus), drake (Anas platyrhynchos), and guinea fowl (Numida meleagris). Profound structural and dimensional changes occurred in both segments (proximal and distal) of the efferent ducts and, in particular, in the nonciliated (Type I) cell of the proximal duct of sexually mature but inactive birds. The subapical tubulovacuolar system was markedly atrophic in nonciliated (Types I and II) cells and the numerous round dense globules of Type I cells that normally occurred in sexually active birds were replaced by fewer and more pleomorphic bodies containing lipofuscin granules in sexually resting birds. Lipid droplets, few and extremely large in inactive drakes but numerous and smaller in size in guinea fowls and domestic fowls, occurred in the Type I cell at both infra- and supranuclear levels of resting but not in prepuberal or sexually active birds. Ciliated cells in both segments of the ducts exhibited fewer and less profound phase-dependent changes ultrastructurally. Generally, the Type I cells of the proximal efferent duct appeared to be more sensitive to androgen deprivation than the Type II cell of the distal efferent duct or ciliated cells in both ducts. These morphologically phase-dependent features of the efferent ducts of birds may be used, together with or independent of testicular changes, in the determination of the status of the testis and epididymis of a male bird with regard to the reproductive cycle, especially in seasonally breeding species.
884	11964497	The vestibular nuclei and vestibuloreticular connections in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.). An anterograde and retrograde tracing study.	Tellegen AJ, Arends JJ, Dubbeldam JL	Brain Behav Evol	 2001;58(4):205-17	 doi: 101159/000057564	The vestibular apparatus provides information about the position and movements of the head. Craniocervical muscles position the head with respect to the upper part of the neck. Motoneurons innervating these muscles are located in the supraspinal nucleus and ventral horn of the rostral cervical cord. Premotor neurons of craniocervical muscles have been found in the medial two-thirds of the medullary reticular formation: the ventromedial part of the parvocellular reticular formation and the gigantocellular reticular formation. In the present study, projections from vestibular nuclei upon craniocervical premotor neurons were investigated using anterograde and retrograde tracers. Vestibulospinal fibers run bilaterally in the medial vestibulospinal tract and ipsilaterally in the lateral vestibulospinal tract. Vestibuloreticular projections are mainly ipsilateral, and originate from the n. vestibularis lateralis pars ventralis and pars dorsalis, and from the n. vestibularis descendens. Terminal labeling is found in the border zone between the parvocellular and gigantocellular reticular formation. These projections show that in addition to direct bilateral vestibulo-craniocervical projections an indirect vestibular pathway to craniocervical motor nuclei exists. The direct pathway probably is the neural substrate for the vestibulocollic reflex, whereas the vestibular projection upon the reticular formation might influence head orientation during various kinds of activities, such as pecking, preening and so on.
885	11936506	Electron microscopic study on the endogenous development of Eimeria mulardi, Chauve, Reynaud and Gounel, 1994: a coccidium from the mule duck.	Pakandl M, Reynaud MC, Chauve CM	Parasitol Res	 2002 Feb;88(2):160-4	 doi: 101007/s004360100509	An electron microscopic study of the endogenous development of Eimeria mulardi Chauve, Reynaud and Gounel, 1994 was carried out in mule ducks which are hybrids of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and the muscovy duck (Cairina moschata). All of the endogenous stages were seen within the nucleus of the host cell. Merozoites arose from ectomerogony and three mutually similar merogonies were noted. The asexual stages were found in leukocyte-like cells in the lamina propria of the jejunum, ileum and caecum, while the gamonts developed in glandular epithelial cells in the same part of the intestine.
886	11924603	Pathogenicity of a Hong Kong-origin H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus for emus, geese, ducks, and pigeons.	Perkins LE, Swayne DE	Avian Dis	 2002 Jan-Mar;46(1):53-63	 doi: 101637/0005-2086(2002)046[0053:POAHKO]20CO;2	The H5N1 type A influenza viruses that emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 are a unique lineage of type A influenza viruses with the capacity to transmit directly from chickens to humans and produce significant disease and mortality in both of these hosts. The objective of this study was to ascertain the susceptibility of emus (Dramaius novaehollandiae), domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus), domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), and pigeons (Columba livia) to intranasal (i.n.) inoculation with the A/chicken/Hong Kong/220/97 (H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. No mortality occurred within 10 days postinoculation (DPI) in the four species investigated, and clinical disease, evident as neurologic dysfunction, was observed exclusively in emus and geese. Grossly, pancreatic mottling and splenomegaly were identified in these two species. In addition, the geese had cerebral malacia and thymic and bursal atrophy. Histologically, both the emus and geese developed pancreatitis, meningoencephalitis, and mild myocarditis. Influenza viral antigen was demonstrated in areas with histologic lesions up to 10 DPI in the geese. Virus was reisolated from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and from the lung, brain, and kidney of the emus and geese. Moderate splenomegaly was observed grossly in the ducks. Viral infection of the ducks was pneumotropic, as evidenced by mild inflammatory lesions in the respiratory tract and virus reisolation from oropharyngeal swabs and from a lung. Pigeons were resistant to HK/220 infection, lacking gross and histologic lesions, viral antigen, and reisolation of virus. These results imply that emus and geese are susceptible to i.n. inoculation with the HK/220 virus, whereas ducks and pigeons are more resistant. These latter two species probably played a minimal epidemiologic role in the perpetuation of the H5N1 Hong Kong-origin influenza viruses.
887	11895012	Effects of diet and soil on the toxicity of lead in mallards.	Sanderson GC	Ecotoxicology	 2002 Feb;11(1):11-7	 doi: 101023/a:1013736912084	Captive game-farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were dosed with five No. 4 lead (Pb) shot and placed on a diet of shelled corn or commercial duck food (6 ducks). Half of the ducks on each diet was dosed daily with 10 g of soil. The commercial duck food provided more protection from the effects of Pb toxicity than the 10 g of soil dosed daily. Ducks on corn only died a mean of 7 days after dosing, ducks receiving commercial duck food, with and without soil, survived to the end of the study (21 days after dosing), and ducks receiving a diet of corn and soil survived an average of 17 days. Although ducks receiving corn only dissolved less Pb, excreted less Pb in their feces, and retained less dissolved Pb than the ducks receiving the other three treatments, they retained more dissolved Pb per day than the other ducks.
888	11879935	Role of selenium toxicity and oxidative stress in aquatic birds.	Hoffman DJ	Aquat Toxicol	 2002 Apr;57(1-2):11-26	 doi: 101016/s0166-445x(01)00263-6	Adverse effects of selenium (Se) in wild aquatic birds have been documented as a consequence of pollution of the aquatic environment by subsurface agricultural drainwater and other sources. These effects include mortality, impaired reproduction with teratogenesis, reduced growth, histopathological lesions and alterations in hepatic glutathione metabolism. A review is provided, relating adverse biological effects of Se in aquatic birds to altered glutathione metabolism and oxidative stress. Laboratory studies, mainly with an organic form of Se, selenomethionine, have revealed oxidative stress in different stages of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) life cycle. As dietary and tissue concentrations of Se increase, increases in plasma and hepatic GSH peroxidase activities occur, followed by dose-dependent increases in the ratio of hepatic oxidized to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH) and ultimately hepatic lipid peroxidation measured as an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). One or more of these oxidative effects were associated with teratogenesis (4.6 ppm wet weight Se in eggs), reduced growth in ducklings (15 ppm Se in liver), diminished immune function (5 ppm Se in liver) and histopathological lesions (29 ppm Se in liver) in adults. Manifestations of Se-related effects on glutathione metabolism were also apparent in field studies in seven species of aquatic birds. Reduced growth and possibly immune function but increased liver:body weight and hepatic GSSG:GSH ratios were apparent in american avocet (Recurvirostra americana) hatchlings from eggs containing 9 ppm Se. In black-necked stilts (Himantopus mexicanus), which contained somewhat lower Se concentrations, a decrease in hepatic GSH was apparent with few other effects. In adult American coots (Fulica americana), signs of Se toxicosis included emaciation, abnormal feather loss and histopathological lesions. Mean liver concentrations of 28 ppm Se (ww) in the coots were associated with elevated hepatic GSH peroxidase, depletion of hepatic protein bound thiols and total thiols, but a small increase in GSH. Diving ducks in the San Francisco Bay area exhibited a positive correlation between hepatic Se concentration and GSH peroxidase activity (r=0.63, P<0.05), but a negative correlation between hepatic Se and GSH concentration (r=-0.740, P<0.05). In willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) from the San Diego area, positive correlations occurred between hepatic Se concentration and GSSG (r=0.70, P<0.001), GSSG:GSH ratio, and TBARS. In emperor geese (Chen canagica) from western Alaska, blood levels of up to 9.4 ppm occurred and were associated with increased plasma GSH peroxidase activity (r=0.62, P<0.001), but with decreased plasma GSSG reductase activity. When evaluating Se toxicity, interactive nutritional factors, including other elements and dietary protein, should also be taken into consideration. Further studies are needed to examine the relationship between different forms of environmentally occurring selenium, arsenic and mercury on reproduction, hepatotoxicity and immune function of aquatic birds. Further selenium nutritional interaction studies may also help to illucidate the mechanism of selenium induced teratogenesis, by optimizing GSH and other antioxidant defense mechanisms in a manner that would stabilize or raise the cell's threshold for susceptibility to toxic attack from excess selenium. It is concluded that Se-related manifestations of oxidative stress may serve as useful bioindicators of Se exposure and toxicity in wild aquatic birds.
889	11838227	Prevalence of Bordetella avium infection in selected wild and domesticated birds in the eastern USA.	Raffel TR, Register KB, Marks SA, Temple L	J Wildl Dis	 2002 Jan;38(1):40-6	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-38140	Bordetella avium is the etiologic agent of bordetellosis, a highly contagious upper respiratory disease of young poultry. Its prevalence among domesticated turkeys is well-known, but information on prevalence of this bacterium in other birds is limited. A survey of the prevalence of B. avium in wild and domesticated birds was conducted from June 1998 to January 2000, using tracheal cultures and serology. Of 237 blood samples from 61 species, 100 individuals from 41 species had antibodies against B. avium as determined with a microtiter agglutination test. Nine isolates of B. avium were cultured from 128 tracheal samples. Ribotype analysis of seven isolates from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), one from a wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), and one from a Canada goose (Branta canadensis) indicated that they represent three strains, two of which were indistinguishable from clinical isolates from domesticated turkeys. Bordetella avium is present in wild bird populations of multiple species. Transmission from free-living avian populations to domesticated poultry populations may be possible and should be examined.

We assessed this problem by considering experimental toxicity data and chemical descriptors. We evaluated several toxicological end-points (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Daphnia magna, Acceptable Daily Intake, Anas Platyrhynchos, Colinus virginianus and Muridae) in the case of pesticides and also considered the availability of toxicological data. We calculated hundreds of molecular descriptors (divided into constitutional, electrostatic, geometrical, quantum-chemical and topological ones) for the selected compounds using CODESSA, HyperChem and Pallas. Molecular descriptors may vary depending on the conformation of the molecules and on the software used. We evaluated the extent of this variability, and compared it with the variability of the experimental toxicological values.

Shoemaker JM, Hempleman SC	Respir Physiol	 2001 Nov 1;128(2):195-204	 doi: 101016/s0034-5687(01)00273-0	Avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) are neurons that sense lung P(CO(2)) and provide phasic feedback for the control of breathing in birds. To try to understand mechanisms of CO(2) transduction and intracellular pH regulation in IPC, the anion exchange inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) was used to block transmembrane Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) transport. Single-unit IPC discharge rates were measured at steady intrapulmonary CO(2) levels and during step changes in CO(2) in 15 anesthetized, unidirectionally ventilated adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Measurements were repeated after giving 50, 100 and 200 micromol/kg cumulative i.v. dosages of DIDS. Mean IPC discharge rates at steady (tonic) P(CO(2)) levels were significantly increased by 100 and 200 micromol/kg DIDS, but not by 50 micromol/kg DIDS. Mean dynamic (phasic) IPC responses to CO(2) steps were not significantly affected by DIDS. Results indicate that the DIDS-sensitive Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) membrane exchanger is involved with tonic CO(2) signal transduction in IPC. However, because some individual IPC were unaffected by DIDS, yet still altered their discharge rate with CO(2), additional mechanisms besides the Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange are probably required for CO(2) chemotransduction in IPC.
892	11760152	Differences in oxidative stress between young Canada geese and mallards exposed to lead-contaminated sediment.	Mateo R, Hoffman DJ	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2001 Dec 7;64(7):531-45	 doi: 101080/15287390152627228	Lead (Pb) exposure results in an increase in tissue lipid peroxides and variation in glutathione (GSH) concentrations, which can be related to peroxidative damage of cell membranes in Pb-poisoned animals. Species and individual variation in sensitivity to Pb poisoning among animals may be due to differential resistance to oxidative stress. The effects of oxidative stress caused by Pb exposure (1.7, 414, and 828 microg/g of diet) were compared for the first 6 wk in growing young of two species of waterfowl, Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), with the first species being possibly more sensitive to Pb poisoning based on previous field and laboratory observations. Blood and liver Pb concentrations increased more in mallards than in geese. This may be explained on the basis of body weight, being 3.2 times higher in geese, and by hepatic metabolism, where GSH S-transferase (GST) activity is 2.9-fold higher in geese and presumably has a role in the binding of Pb to GSH and subsequent biliary excretion. In contrast, mallards showed higher hepatic levels of GSH and activities of CSH peroxidase (GPX) and GSH reductase (GR). Although both species showed a rise in hepatic GSH concentration with Pb exposure, the relationship between increased lipid peroxidation and Pb exposure was only significant in geese. Within treatment groups, hepatic GSH concentrations were inversely related to liver Pb concentrations in both species, which may correspond to the role of GSH in Pb excretion. Hepatic GSH was also inversely related to hepatic lipid peroxidation, but only in mallards and in agreement with the species differences observed in GPX and GR activities. The lower resistance to lipid peroxidation of Canada geese may explain why geese can die in the field from Pb poisoning after ingesting fewer shot than found in the gizzards of mallards and with lower liver Pb concentrations than in mallards.
893	11719286	Molecular cloning of the cDNAs for pituitary glycoprotein hormone alpha subunits of two species of duck and their gene regulation.	Hsieh YL, Chatterjee A, Chien JT, Yu JY	J Mol Endocrinol	 2001 Dec;27(3):339-47	 doi: 101677/jme00270339	The cDNAs encoding pituitary glycoprotein hormone alpha subunits (PGHalphas) of two species of duck (Muscovy duck, Cairina moschata and Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were cloned and sequenced to better understand the phylogenic diversity and evolution of PGHalpha molecules in vertebrates. Oligonucleotide primers were designed and used for reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of PGHalpha cDNA fragments from total cellular RNA of pituitary glands. The remaining sequences were completed by rapid amplification of the cDNA ends. The nucleotide sequence of isolated PGHalpha cDNA of both ducks are identical, including 81 bp of 5' untranslated region (UTR), 360 bp of coding region, and 272 bp of 3'-UTR followed by a 13 bp poly(A)(+) tract. The total number of amino acids deduced from the cDNA of the duck PGHalpha is 120 with a signal peptide of 24 amino acids and a mature protein of 96 amino acids. PGHalphas of the ducks (order Anseriformes) share 96% homology of amino acid sequence in signal peptide, and 100% homology in mature proteins with chicken, quail and turkey (order Galliformes). Our data thus demonstrate identical inter-order homology of PGHalpha mature protein in birds. Ten cysteine residues, presumably forming five disulfide bonds within the alpha subunit, and four proline residues, presumably responsible for folding of the molecule, are conserved in the alpha subunit of ducks. Northern blot analysis revealed that PGHalpha mRNA is expressed only in the pituitary. In order to study factors regulating the gene expression of PGHalpha mRNA, duck pituitary fragments were incubated with GnRH, TRH, testosterone, or triiodothyronine (T(3)). GnRH and TRH increased, while testosterone and T(3) decreased, PGHalpha mRNA levels. This is the first report in birds of TRH up-regulation and down-regulation by testosterone and T(3) under in vitro conditions. The present study demonstrates both ducks have the same cDNA nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences in the PGHalpha subunit, exhibiting identical inter-genus homology within the family of Anatidae. The findings from mRNA expression work suggest that hypothalamic GnRH and TRH up-regulate, while testosterone and T(3) down-regulate, PGHalpha gene expression in ducks.
894	11584754	Genetic variability among cercariae of the Schistosomatidae (Trematoda: Digenea) causing swimmer's itch in Europe.	Picard D, Jousson O	Parasite	 2001 Sep;8(3):237-42	 doi: 101051/parasite/2001083237	Ribosomal DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) were obtained from schistosome cercariae responsible for swimmer's itch in Europe. Two types of ITS1 (1100 and 1400), which differ by the number of repeated patterns were found among cercariae shedded by Lymnaea ovata and L. auricularia (Lymnaeidae). A phylogenetic analysis of the ITS1 region showed that sequences of each type form two well-defined clades. An adult of Trichobilharzia regenti isolated from the nasal vessels of Anas platyrhynchos (Anatidae) was found to correspond to the cercaria type 1400. The sequencing of several ITS1 clones from a single cercaria of each type, as well as a specific PCR-based test suggested that both ITS1 types do not co-occur within a single individual.
895	11572618	Behaviour of domestic ducks exposed to mobile predator stimuli. 2. The association of individual duckling attributes with relative position in a flock.	Henderson JV, Lines JA, Wathes CM, White RP, Nicol CJ	Br Poult Sci	 2001 Sep;42(4):439-48	 doi: 101080/00071660120070659	1. We investigated whether an individual duckling's (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) attributes were associated with its response to an approaching human when it was a member of one of three flocks of 12. 2. Each individual was scored according to its response to (i) an approaching human when alone and feeding, (ii) a taxidermist's model fox when alone and feeding, and (iii) an approaching human when alone in a 9 m annulus, and its nearest neighbour distance in the home pen, competitiveness for food in a series of paired encounters, running ability and physical characteristics. 3. Each flock was herded around a 7 m diameter annulus in separate trials by a human walking at 0.5ms(-1). The distance maintained by each duckling from the human, and hence its relative flock position, was calculated. 4. Individual flight distance maintained from an approaching human when alone in an annulus was the attribute that predicted distance maintained from an approaching human when part of a flock. 5. Some ducklings had reduced average distances from an approaching human when they were in a flock compared to when they were tested alone, and inter-individual variation in distance from the human was greatly reduced when birds were part of a flock.
896	11563650	Stable nitrogen isotopes in waterfowl feathers reflect agricultural land use in western Canada.	Hebert CE, Wassenaar LI	Environ Sci Technol	 2001 Sep 1;35(17):3482-7	 doi: 101021/es001970p	Stable nitrogen and carbon isotope analysis was performed on secondary feathers collected from flightless, mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) from 17 locations across western Canada. The delta15N values of mallard feathers ranged from +6.1 to +23.7 per thousand (AIR). Mean delta15N feather values from the 17 locations were strongly correlated with the percentage of land under agricultural development. Higher delta15N values in waterfowl feathers collected from agricultural areas possibly reflected the entry of excess fertilizer nitrogen into local water bodies. However, other processes may have also been important. These results provide evidence that nitrogen isotope values in avian feathers may reflect long-term nitrogen additions to surface waters in agricultural areas and may also provide important clues in elucidating the origin of nonpoint source nitrogen inputs.
897	11558908	Brain alterations in crested versus non-crested breeds of domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f.d.).	Frahm HD, Rehkamper G, Werner CW	Poult Sci	 2001 Sep;80(9):1249-57	 doi: 101093/ps/8091249	A comparison of brain size and brain composition was made between two uncrested duck breeds and Crested Ducks (CR) and between CR individuals that do possess crests and those that do not have the crest. Domestic ducks of the breed CR have allometrically larger brains than uncrested duck breeds. The crest inserts on a cushion of fat and connective tissue that is partly nourished by brain vessels via small holes in the skull. Through these holes, fat tissue may invade the brain cavity. Because the fat accumulations are sometimes hidden deep between the telencephalon, tectum, and cerebellum, they may be invisible macroscopically and, thus, give the impression of a large brain. The size of the crest, however, is not strictly correlated with fat accumulations in the brain, because 2 among 10 specimens of CR showed no fat body at all, and the investigation of 10 uncrested CR (ducks from the same genetic stock, but without the crests) also revealed fat accumulations in 6 specimens. After subtraction of the volume of the fat body, the brain volume of CR (crested and uncrested) was of equal size to that of "Hochbrutflugenten" and Pommeranian ducks, as was the volumes of most brain structures measured. Significantly smaller in CR were the olfactory bulbs, the prepiriform area, and the cerebellum, which was always situated in close proximity to the fat body in CR.
898	11556117	Use of a simulated gizzard to measure bioavailability of metals and other elements to waterfowl.	Levengood JM, Skowron LM	Ecotoxicology	 2001 Oct;10(5):299-304	 doi: 101023/a:1016763418647	We used a simulated gizzard environment to examine the bioavailability of barium, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc to wild and sentinel mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) using a seasonally-flooded wetland. This impoundment was originally constructed as a containment area for dredged sediments which were contaminated through previous smelting operations. Extraction of elements from gizzard contents indicated that sentinel mallards experienced greater exposure to contaminants than their wild counterparts. Concentrations of the selected elements extracted from ingesta were lower than in seeds and sediments from the study site. Notable exceptions were barium and lead, which were not detected in seeds of some plant species, though they were present in the ingesta of one or more treatment groups. This technique may provide a more realistic means of estimating bioavailability and exposure than methods which measure total concentrations of elements in dietary components. The use of sentinel mallards may result in inflated estimates of risk to wild ducks using seasonally-available wetlands.
899	11504220	Reproductive effects and duckling survivability following chronic dosing with tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot in adult game-farm mallards.	Mitchell RR, Fitzgerald SD, Aulerich RJ, Balander RJ, Powell DC, Tempelmen RJ, Stevens W, Bursia SJ	J Wildl Dis	 2001 Jul;37(3):468-74	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-373468	Tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot were given conditional approval for waterfowl hunting by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service based partly on the results of a 30-day acute toxicity trial utilizing mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Final approval of the two tungsten-containing shot was contingent on the results of a 150-day study that assessed the health and reproductive effects of tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot in adult mallards. Reproductive data are presented in this paper. Sixteen male and 16 female adult mallards were dosed orally with eight #4 steel shot (control), eight #4 tungsten-iron shot, or eight #4 tungsten-polymer shot on days 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 of a 150-day trial (26 January 1998 to 25 June 1998). Reproductive performance was assessed during the last 90 days (day 61 to day 150) of the trial. There were no significant differences in egg production and fertility and hatchability of eggs from tungsten-iron- and tungsten-polymer-dosed ducks compared to control ducks. There was no evidence of differences in percent survivability and body weight of ducklings from tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer mallards compared to ducklings from control ducks. Tungsten-iron or tungsten-polymer shot repeatedly administered to adult mallards during the 150 day trial did not adversely affect reproduction or their offspring.
900	11504219	Hematological effects and metal residue concentrations following chronic dosing with tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot in adult game-farm mallards.	Mitchell RR, Fitzgerald SD, Aulerich RJ, Balander RJ, Powell DC, Tempelman RJ, Cray C, Stevens W, Bursian SJ	J Wildl Dis	 2001 Jul;37(3):459-67	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-373459	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service required a chronic dosing study that assessed the health and reproductive effects of tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot in adult game-farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) prior to granting permanent approval of the shot for waterfowl hunting. Herein, we present the effects of tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot on various hematologic parameters and metal residue concentrations in the femur, liver, kidneys, and gonads. Thirty-two-bird groups (sexes equal) of adult mallards were dosed orally with eight #4 steel shot (control), eight #4 tungsten-iron shot, or eight #4 tungsten-polymer shot on days 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 of a 150 day trial (26 January 1998 to 25 June 1998). An additional 12 mallards (sexes equal) received eight #4 lead shot (positive control) on day 0 of the study. Lead-dosed mallards had significantly decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and whole-blood delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity on day 7, as well as significant changes in a number of plasma chemistry parameters compared to ducks in the control, tungsten-iron, or tungsten-polymer groups. Mallards dosed with tungsten-iron or tungsten-polymer shot had occasional significant differences in hematocrit and plasma chemistry values when compared to control mallards over the 150 day period, but these changes were not considered to be indicative of deleterious effects. Low concentrations of tungsten were detected in gonad and kidney samples from males and females and in liver samples from females dosed with tungsten-polymer shot. Tungsten was also detected in femur samples from tungsten-polymer-dosed mallards. Higher concentrations of tungsten were detected in femur, liver, kidney, and gonad samples from tungsten-iron-dosed ducks. Tungsten-iron or tungsten-polymer shot repeatedly administered to adult mallards did not cause adverse hematological effects during the 150 day trial. Concentrations of tungsten in the femur, liver, kidneys, and gonads were generally higher in tungsten-iron-dosed ducks when compared to tungsten-polymer-dosed ducks.
901	11504218	Health effects following chronic dosing with tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot in adult game-farm mallards.	Mitchell RR, Fitzgerald SD, Aulerich RJ, Balander RJ, Powell DC, Tempelman RJ, Stickle RL, Stevens W, Bursian SJ	J Wildl Dis	 2001 Jul;37(3):451-8	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-373451	Permanent approval of shot composed of tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer for waterfowl hunting by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was pending the results of the present study that examined the health and reproductive effects of the two shot types on mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) over a 150-day period. We collected data pertaining to the effects of tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer shot on mortality, body weight, organ weight, tissue pathology, and shot erosion. Thirty-two bird groups (sexes equal) of adult mallards were dosed orally with eight #4 steel shot (control), eight #4 tungsten-iron shot, or eight #4 tungsten-polymer shot on days 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 of a 150-day trial (26 January 1998 to 25 June 1998). An additional 12 mallards (sexes equal) were dosed orally with eight #4 lead shot (positive control) on day 0 of the study. All lead-dosed ducks died by day 25, whereas no ducks died in the other treatment groups. Significant liver hemosiderosis was present in all control and tungsten-iron-dosed males, in five of eight control and three of eight tungsten-iron-dosed females, and in one tungsten-polymer-dosed male examined. The rate of shot erosion was highest for tungsten-polymer shot (99%), followed by tungsten-iron (72%), and steel (55%) shot. Tungsten-iron or tungsten-polymer shot repeatedly administered to adult mallards did not have deleterious health effects during the 150-day trial based on mortality, body weights, organ weights, and histology of the liver and kidneys.
902	11482602	Salpingitis in Pekin ducks associated with concurrent infection with Tetratrichomonas sp. and Escherichia coli.	Crespo R, Walker RL, Nordhausen R, Sawyer SJ, Manalac RB	J Vet Diagn Invest	 2001 May;13(3):240-5	 doi: 101177/104063870101300309	Increased mortality (1.5% per week) and low egg production (5-10% lower than normal) were observed in a flock of domestic breeding Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). At necropsy, salpingitis and peritonitis were the most significant findings. Histologically, there was accumulation of necrotic debris in the lumen of the oviduct. Numerous bacteria and trichomonads were observed histologically in the lumen of the vagina and occasionally in the shell gland. Escherichia coli and a trichomonad were isolated from the oviduct. The trichomonads were oval (6-8 microm long, 4.5-6 microm wide) and had 4 anterior flagella and an undulating membrane extending over the entire length of the body, finishing in a long posterior flagellum. Morphology was consistent with trichomonads of the genus Tetratrichomonas. Comparative sequence analysis of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene and the flanking internal transcribed space regions of the trichomonad isolate did not closely match with available sequences of the same region of other trichomonadid protozoa.
903	11460741	Towards molecular understanding of species differences in dioxin sensitivity: initial characterization of Ah receptor cDNAs in birds and an amphibian.	Karchner SI, Kennedy SW, Trudeau S, Hahn ME	Mar Environ Res	 2000 Jul-Dec;50(1-5):51-6	 doi: 101016/s0141-1136(00)00045-3	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) are highly toxic to most vertebrate animals, but there are dramatic species differences in sensitivity, both within and among vertebrate classes. For example, studies in cultured avian hepatocytes have revealed differential sensitivity of birds to PHAHs [Kennedy et al. (1996). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 141, 214-230]. Differences in the characteristics or expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) could contribute to these species differences in PHAH responsiveness. To investigate the molecular mechanism of differential PHAH sensitivity, we have begun to characterize the AHR in white leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus), Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and common tern (Sterna hirundo), as well as an amphibian, mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus). Partial AHR cDNAs encompassing the helix-loop-helix and PAS domains were cloned and sequenced. Comparison of amino acid sequences in this region indicated a high degree of sequence conservation among the bird species (97% amino acid identity). The percent identity between bird sequences and either mouse or mudpuppy was lower (79%); the mudpuppy AHR was 74% identical to the mouse AHR. Phylogenetic analysis of these and other AHR amino acid sequences showed that the bird and mudpuppy AHRs were more closely related to mammalian and fish AHR1 forms than to fish AHR2. Future studies include the in vitro expression and functional characterization of AHRs from these and other non-mammalian vertebrates.
904	11405270	Magnetic resonance imaging of intracranial tissue accumulations in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) with feather crests.	Bartels T, Brinkmeier J, Portmann S, Baulain U, Zinke A, Krautwald-Junghanns ME, Boos A, Wolf P, Kummerfeld N	Vet Radiol Ultrasound	 2001 May-Jun;42(3):254-8	 doi: 101111/j1740-82612001tb00936x	The crested breed of domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) has been described as a variety which has high pre- and postnatal mortalities, malformations in skull and brain anatomy, and several central nervous deficiencies. In addition, intracranial tissue accumulations have been diagnosed in purebred Crested ducks. The incidence, heredity and inheritance of these accumulations as well as their pathogenesis are still generally unknown. The aims of this study were to examine the head of Crested ducks, plain-headed duck breeds, and their crossbreeding relating to the incidence of intracranial alterations. These examinations were performed using magnetic resonance imaging. We found a high incidence of intracranial tissue accumulations in domestic ducks with feather crests. Creasted ducks had more intracranial tissue deposits than plain-headed ducks (p < 0.001). In the present study a correlation between the volume of the crest cushion and the volume of the intracranial tissue deposit could not be found (r = 0.014). Some of the Crested ducks had encephaloceles in addition to the crest cushion.
905	11404311	Role of plasma ANG II in the excretion of acute sodium load in a bird with salt glands (Anas platyrhynchos).	Heinz MK, Gray DA	Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol	 2001 Jul;281(1):R346-51	 doi: 101152/ajpregu20012811R346	This study was designed to further examine the role of plasma ANG II in the excretion of sodium in the Pekin duck, a bird with salt glands. Renal and extrarenal (salt gland) excretion of an intravenously administered isotonic saline load was monitored over a 4-h period in a group of eight birds under two conditions: the control condition, in which isotonic saline infusion decreased endogenous plasma ANG II from 102.6 to 16.5 pg/ml, and the experimental condition, in which ANG II suppression was prevented by intravenous infusion of a 3.5 ng. kg(-1). min(-1) dose of synthetic ANG II. ANG II infusion significantly decreased the total sodium excretion (by 15%), primarily via an inhibition of salt gland output. The results suggest that ANG II suppression facilitates the excretion of an administered sodium load in birds with salt glands.
906	11318587	Susceptibility of avian hosts to experimental Gymnophalloides seoi infection.	Ryang YS, Yoo JC, Lee SH, Chai JY	J Parasitol	 2001 Apr;87(2):454-6	 doi: 101645/0022-3395(2001)087[0454:SOAHTE]20CO;2	To determine whether avian species are susceptible to infection with Gymnophalloides seoi (a human-infecting intestinal trematode), we exposed 7 species of birds with metacercariae obtained from oysters. The birds were necropsied at days 2, 4, and 6 postinfection (PI). The highest worm recovery at day 6 PI was obtained from the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus; mean = 56.0%), followed by the Mongolian plover (C. mongolus; 49.3%), and the grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola; 32.3%). In contrast, no mature worms were recovered from the great knot (Calidris tenuirostris), dunlin (C. alpina), black-tailed gull (Larus crassirostris), and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Among the plovers, the worms attained the greatest size at day 6 PI (254.1 x 190.4 microm) in the Kentish plover, with a significantly higher number of eggs in the uterus. The 3 species of plovers are highly susceptible to experimental G. seoi infection, suggesting that they could play a role as definitive hosts for these worms in nature.
907	11316495	Dynamics of mallard (Anas platyrynchos) gastrocnemius function during swimming versus terrestrial locomotion.	Biewener AA, Corning WR	J Exp Biol	 2001 May;204(Pt 10):1745-56	 doi: 101242/jeb204101745	This study investigates how the contractile function of a muscle may be modulated to accommodate changes in locomotor mode and differences in the physical environment. In vivo recordings of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) activation, force development (measured using tendon buckle transducers) and length change (measured using sonomicrometry) were obtained from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) as they swam at steady speeds in a water tank and walked or ran on land. LG force recordings were compared with combined lateral and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle-tendon force recordings obtained from the contralateral limb, allowing force development by the MG to be estimated relative to that of the LG. Although similar stresses were calculated to act in the LG and MG muscles during terrestrial locomotion (126 and 115 kPa, respectively), stresses were considerably greater in the LG compared with the MG during swimming (62 versus 34 kPa, respectively). During both steady swimming and terrestrial locomotion, the LG developed force while shortening over a considerable range of its length (swimming 23.6 % versus terrestrial 37.4 %). Activation of the muscle occurred near the end of passive lengthening during the recovery stroke, just prior to muscle shortening. As a result, the muscle generated broad positive work loops during both locomotor modes. LG work during swimming (4.8 J x kg(-1)) averaged 37 % of the work performed during terrestrial locomotion (13.1 J x kg(-1)), consistent with the twofold greater force and 58 % greater strain of the muscle during walking and running. Because limb cycle frequency was similar for the two locomotor modes (swimming 2.65 versus terrestrial 2.61 Hz), differences in power output (swimming 12.6 W x kg(-1 )versus terrestrial 32.4 W x kg(-1)) largely reflected difference in work per cycle. Tendon elastic energy savings was a small fraction (<5 %) of the work performed by the muscle, consistent with a fiber-tendon design of these two muscles that favors muscle work to produce limb movement with little tendon strain. These results are consistent with a higher cost of terrestrial locomotion in ducks compared with other, more cursorial birds that may operate their muscles more economically and achieve greater tendon elastic savings.
908	11312653	Role of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense in 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl-induced toxicity and species-differential sensitivity in chicken and duck embryos.	Jin X, Kennedy SW, Di Muccio T, Moon TW	Toxicol Appl Pharmacol	 2001 May 1;172(3):241-8	 doi: 101006/taap20019150	The role of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense in 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126)-induced toxicity and species-specific sensitivity was examined in White Leghorn chicken (Gallus domesticus) and Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) embryos. Eggs were injected into the air cell with 0.4-1.6 microgram PCB 126/kg egg in corn oil prior to incubation. Lipid peroxidation measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), the GSSG:GSH ratio, and glutathione peroxidase (GPox) activities were determined in liver and adipose tissue of day 19 chicken and day 26 duck embryos. In chicken embryos, PCB 126 increased mortality and the incidence of edema and liver lesions, decreased embryo size, increased eye and head malformations, and markedly reduced fat storage. In contrast, no effects on the endpoints were observed in duck embryos even at the highest dose used in chicken embryos. PCB 126 increased hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in a dose-dependent manner in chicken but not duck embryos. PCB 126 significantly increased TBARS levels in liver and to a greater degree in adipose tissue of chicken embryos, indicating that adipose tissue is a sensitive target for this compound. Increases in lipid peroxidation by PCB 126 were associated with significant decreases in GPox activity in these tissues. These biochemical changes support oxidative stress playing a role in PCB 126-induced embryo toxicity while antioxidant defenses provided protection against oxidative damage induced by this compound. Ducks, the less-sensitive species, showed higher basal levels of hepatic GPox than chickens, suggesting that this antioxidant enzyme may contribute to the differences in sensitivity to this compound between the two species.
909	11310887	Duck plague epizootics in the United States, 1967-1995.	Converse KA, Kidd GA	J Wildl Dis	 2001 Apr;37(2):347-57	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-372347	In 1967, the first confirmed diagnosis of duck plague (DP) in the USA was made from pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) on commercial duck farms on Long Island, New York. Within 10 mo, DP was confirmed as the cause of death in migratory waterfowl on a Long Island bay. This paper reviews 120 DP epizootics reported from 1967 to 1995 that involved waterfowl species native to North America or were reported in areas with free-flying waterfowl at risk. Duck plague epizootics occurred in 21 states with the greatest number reported in Maryland (29), New York (18), California (16), and Pennsylvania (13). The greatest frequency of epizootics (86%) was detected during the months of March to June. At least 40 waterfowl species were affected with the highest frequency of epizootics reported in captive or captive-reared ducks including muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) (68%), mallard ducks (A. platyrhynchos) (18%) and black ducks (A. rubripes) (14%). The greatest number of waterfowl died in three epizootics that involved primarily migratory birds in 1967 and 1994 in New York (USA) and 1973 in South Dakota (USA). The greatest number of DP epizootics reported since 1967 appear to have involved flocks of non-migratory rather than migratory waterfowl; therefore, in our opinion it remains unknown if DP is enzootic in either non-migratory or migratory waterfowl.
910	11268834	Bioaccumulation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in the foodweb of Ya-Er Lake area, China.	Wu WZ, Schramm KW, Kettrup A	Water Res	 2001 Apr;35(5):1141-8	 doi: 101016/s0043-1354(00)00376-6	Bioaccumulation of PCDD/F in the foodweb was investigated in the Ya-Er Lake area, which was heavily polluted by PCDD/F. The high concentrations of PCDD/F in sediment can be transferred and bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms and humans through various pathways. Benthonic invertebrate animals and aquatic plants with a lot of fibers in the root can accumulate PCDD/F from sediment and water. Snail (Bellamya aeruginosa), shrimp (Macrobranchium sp.) and freshwater mussel (Acuticosta chinensis (Lea)) took up PCDD/F from the water and maintained the emission patterns, whereas fish tended to selectively accumulate 2,3,7,8-substituted isomers. The tissues of fish-eating bird and duck (Anas platyrhynchos) were very highly contaminated by PCDD/F due to ingestion of fish and other aquatic organisms from sediment. The residual concentration in breast milk depended on the original concentration of PCDD/F in the food. A resident in Ya-Er Lake area showed a daily intake of PCDD/F of about 9.14 pg TEQ/kg body weight/day. This is higher than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for PCDD/F (1 pg TEQ/kg body weight/day), which was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
911	11234542	Persistent organochlorine levels in six prey species of the gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus in Iceland.	Olafsdottir K, Petersen AE, Magnusdottir EV, Bjornsson T, Johannesson T	Environ Pollut	 2001;112(2):245-51	 doi: 101016/s0269-7491(00)00115-9	Our previous investigations have revealed very high levels of organochlorines (OCs) in the Icelandic gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus, a resident top predator. We now examine six potential prey species of birds, both resident and migratory, in order to elucidate the most likely route of the OCs to the gyrfalcon. The ptarmigan Lagopus mutus, the most important prey of the gyrfalcon, contained very low levels of OCs. Bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and DDTs in mallards Anas platyrhynchos, tufted ducks Aythya fuligula, golden plovers Pluvialis apricaria, purple sandpipers Calidris maritima, and black guillemots Cepphus grylle reflected their position in the foodchain. The differences in OC-levels seem nevertheless too high just to reflect the different food-chain levels of these species in Iceland. The winter grounds of the migratory golden plovers and tufted ducks appear to be more contaminated than the Icelandic terrestrial habitat of ptarmigans or the freshwater habitat as reflected in mallards, both resident species. However, spending the winter on the coast in Iceland, results in high levels of contaminants in purple sandpipers and black guillemots. Our results indicate OC contamination of the marine ecosystem in Iceland while the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems are little affected. It is postulated that gyrfalcons receive the major part of the observed contamination from prey other than ptarmigan, especially birds associated with the marine ecosystem and also from migratory birds.
912	11206986	Osteological investigations of the incidence of cranial alterations in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) with feather crests.	Bartels T, Brinkmeier J, Portmann S, Krautwald-Junghanns ME, Kummerfeld N, Boos A	Ann Anat	 2001 Jan;183(1):73-80	 doi: 101016/S0940-9602(01)80017-0	The feather crest of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) represents a peculiar mutation of the integument of the head, which has been known since the 17th century. In literature this is described as a variety with malformations in skull and brain anatomy in which various central nervous deficiencies in affected birds are possible. Our examinations demonstrated several conspicuous anatomical alterations in the skulls of domestic ducks with feather crests. Osteophytes of different size in the hypodermis of the crest integument were found as well as cranial perforations located in the parieto-occipital region. In morphometric studies, a significant increase in the capacity of the cranium was found in Crested ducks compared to other examined breeds (Abacot Ranger, German Pekin ducks). This increase in cranial capacity in Crested ducks results from the occurrence and enlargement of a tentorial fatty depot during craniogenesis. The formation and enlargement of the fat body can influence cranium growth as long as the cranial bones are not entirely fused. Thus, in comparison to other phenotypically similar domesticated birds like the crested chicken, the expression of feather crests in domestic ducks demonstrates symptomatologic differences. In conclusion, our examinations demonstrate that the skulls of Crested ducks show various peculiar morphological alterations whose genesis is up to now not known with satisfactory accuracy. Further investigations are continuing to assertain whether there are linkages between cranial alterations (malformations of the calvaria, osteophytes, increased capacity of the cranium) and the extremely high prenatal and postnatal mortalities and numerous abnormalities described in crested breeds of the domestic duck.
913	11205534	Effects of diquat, an aquatic herbicide, on the development of mallard embryos.	Sewalk CJ, Brewer GL, Hoffman DJ	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2001 Jan 12;62(1):33-45	 doi: 101080/00984100050201659	Bipyridylium herbicides produce embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in dipteran, amphibian, avian, and mammalian organisms. Diquat dibromide, a bipyridylium compound, is commonly used as an aquatic herbicide. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) eggs were exposed to diquat by immersing the eggs for 10 s in solutions of 0.88, 3.5, 7, 14, or 56 g/L on either d 4 or 21 of incubation. Application of diquat on d 4 yielded an estimated LC50 of 19.5 g/L through 18 d of incubation, and 9.6 g/L through hatching. Body and organ weights, and bone lengths of hatchlings did not differ between control and treatment groups with the exception of a slight increase in brain weight in the 14 g/L group. Malformations in diquat-treated embryos included defects of the brain, eye, bill, limb, and pelvis; skeletal scoliosis; and incomplete ossification. Subcutaneous edema was also present. Significant manifestations of oxidative stress were apparent in hatchlings and included increased hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) (lipid peroxidation) and decreased brain reduced glutathione (GSH). Brain protein-bound sulfhydryls (PBSH) increased. Diquat applied on d 21 of incubation yielded an estimated LC50 of 12.6 g/L through hatching. Exposure at this late stage of development did not produce deformities. Body and organ weights and, bone lengths of hatchlings did not differ between control and treatment groups. Significant manifestations of oxidative stress in hatchlings included decreased brain GSH, increased oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and ratio of GSSG to GSH. This study suggests that concentrations of diquat commonly used for aquatic weed control, when based upon the dilution effect of average water depth of the application area, would probably have little impact on mallard embryos. However, concentrations applied above ground to weeds and cattails along ditches could adversely affect the survival and development of mallard embryos, and presumably other avian species nesting in such habitats.
914	11171301	Pectoralis muscle performance during ascending and slow level flight in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Williamson MR, Dial KP, Biewener AA	J Exp Biol	 2001 Feb;204(Pt 3):495-507	 doi: 101242/jeb2043495	In vivo measurements of pectoralis muscle length change and force production were obtained using sonomicrometry and delto-pectoral bone strain recordings during ascending and slow level flight in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). These measurements provide a description of the force/length properties of the pectoralis under dynamic conditions during two discrete flight behaviors and allow an examination of the effects of differences in body size and morphology on pectoralis performance by comparing the results with those of a recent similar study of slow level flight in pigeons (Columbia livia). In the present study, the mallard pectoralis showed a distinct pattern of active lengthening during the upstroke. This probably enhances the rate of force generation and the magnitude of the force generated and, thus, the amount of work and power produced during the downstroke. The power output of the pectoralis averaged 17.0 W kg(-)(1 )body mass (131 W kg(-)(1 )muscle mass) during slow level flight (3 m s(-)(1)) and 23.3 W kg(-)(1 )body mass (174 W kg(-)(1 )muscle mass) during ascending flight. This increase in power was achieved principally via an increase in muscle strain (29 % versus 36 %), rather than an increase in peak force (107 N versus 113 N) or cycle frequency (8.4 Hz versus 8.9 Hz). Body-mass-specific power output of mallards during slow level flight (17.0 W kg(-)(1)), measured in terms of pectoralis mechanical power, was similar to that measured recently in pigeons (16.1 W kg(-)(1)). Mallards compensate for their greater body mass and proportionately smaller wing area and pectoralis muscle volume by operating with a high myofibrillar stress to elevate mechanical power output.
915	11127414	Morphological and pathological effects of cadmium ingestion on Pekin ducks exposed to saline.	Hughes MR, Smits JE, Elliott JE, Bennett DC	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2000 Dec 15;61(7):591-608	 doi: 101080/00984100050194117	This study examined the effects of simultaneous exposure to saline and cadmium (Cd) on organ mass and histology of a bird with salt glands, the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos. Three mixed-sex groups, each containing 6 birds, ate duck pellets containing 0, 50, or 300 microg Cd/g, respectively, for 4 1/2 mo and drank 300 mM NaCl. Only females on the high-Cd diet lost body mass. Ingestion of Cd reduced heart mass in females. There was increased mass of Harderian and salt glands in both sexes. Mass of kidneys and liver increased only in males, and the gut mass (also length) increased more in males. Cadmium ingestion also induced (1) inflammation of renal interstitium and degenerative tubular changes, (2) marked degenerative changes in testes, (3) increased heart water content, (4) decreased cytoplasmic volume of liver cells, (5) reduced proportion of basophilic granular cells in chromaffin tissue of the adrenal glands, and (6) in the ileum, increased heterophilia in the lamina propria and, only in females, the apoptosis to mitosis ratio in crypt cells of the epithelium. The ducks' outward appearance gave no indication that ingesting large amounts of cadmium for 4 1/2 mo produced deleterious effects, but the physiological consequences were profound. Both sexes had greatly reduced gonadal mass and the males produced no sperm. The higher dietary level greatly hypertrophied the liver, kidneys, and gut only in males. The cadmium-induced changes in organs, particularly in the gonads, kidneys, and adrenal glands, should greatly impair the health and reproductive capacity of these ducks.
916	11080061	Benzolamide, acetazolamide, and signal transduction in avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors.	Hempleman SC, Rodriguez TA, Bhagat YA, Begay RS	Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol	 2000 Dec;279(6):R1988-95	 doi: 101152/ajpregu20002796R1988	Intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) are CO(2)-sensitive sensory neurons that innervate the lungs of birds, help control the rate and depth of breathing, and require carbonic anhydrase (CA) for normal function. We tested whether the CA enzyme is located intracellularly or extracellularly in IPC by comparing the effect of a CA inhibitor that is membrane permeable (iv acetazolamide) with one that is relatively membrane impermeable (iv benzolamide). Single cell extracellular recordings were made from vagal filaments in 16 anesthetized, unidirectionally ventilated mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Without CA inhibition, action potential discharge rate was inversely proportional to inspired PCO(2) (-9.0 +/- 0.8 s(-1). lnTorr(-1); means +/- SE, n = 16) and exhibited phasic responses to rapid PCO(2) changes. Benzolamide (25 mg/kg iv) raised the discharge rate but did not alter tonic IPC PCO(2) response (-9.8 +/- 1.6 s(-1). lnTorr(-1), n = 8), and it modestly attenuated phasic responses. Acetazolamide (10 mg/kg iv) raised IPC discharge, significantly reduced tonic IPC PCO(2) response to -3.5 +/- 3.6 s(-1). lnTorr(-1) (n = 6), and severely attenuated phasic responses. Results were consistent with an intracellular site for CA that is less accessible to benzolamide. A model of IPC CO(2) transduction is proposed.
917	11048678	Metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene by duck liver microsomes.	Honey S, O'Keefe P, Drahushuk AT, Olson JR, Kumar S, Sikka HC	Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol	 2000 Jul;126(3):285-92	 doi: 101016/s0742-8413(00)00121-3	The metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene [BP], a model carcinogenic PAH, by hepatic microsomes of two duck species, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and common merganser (Mergus merganser americanus) collected from chemically-contaminated and relatively non-contaminated areas was investigated. The rate of metabolism of BP by liver microsomes of common merganser and mallard collected from polluted areas (2,650 +/- 310 and 2,200 +/- 310 pmol/min per mg microsomal protein, respectively) was significantly higher than that obtained with liver microsomes of the two species collected from non-polluted areas (334 +/- 33 and 231 +/- 30 pmol/min per mg microsomal protein, respectively). The level of cytochrome P-450 1A1 was significantly higher in the liver microsomes of both duck species from the polluted areas as compared to the ducks from the non-polluted areas. The major BP metabolites, including BP-9, 10-diol, BP-4, 5-diol, BP-7, 8-diol, BP-1, 6-dione, BP-3, 6-dione, BP-6, 12-dione, 9-hydroxy-BP and 3-hydroxy-BP, formed by liver microsomes of both duck species from polluted and non-polluted areas, were qualitatively similar. However, the patterns of these metabolites were considerably different from each other. Liver microsomes of ducks from the polluted areas produced a higher proportion of benzo-ring dihydrodiols than the liver microsomes of ducks from the non-polluted areas, which converted a greater proportion of BP to BP-phenols. The predominant enantiomer of BP-7,8-diol formed by hepatic microsomes of the two duck species had an (-)R,R absolute stereochemistry. The data suggest that duck and rat liver microsomal enzymes have different regioselectivity but similar stereoselectivity in the metabolism of BP.
918	10969189	Foraging methods can affect patch choice: an experimental study in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Guillemain M, Fritz H, Blais S	Behav Processes	 2000 Aug 17;50(2-3):123-129	 doi: 101016/s0376-6357(00)00095-4	Animals can adapt to changes in feeding conditions by switching between foraging methods. Dabbling ducks use different foraging methods, including dabbling in deep water with the head and neck submerged, and grubbing in the mud (or shallow water) where the eyes are above the surface, so the bird can visually monitor its environment while foraging. Deep foraging is considered to provide lower intake rates and to have high associated costs, such as predation risk, compared to shallow foraging. Ducks should thus prefer shallow foraging and switch to deeper methods when feeding conditions deteriorate. We conducted a set of experiments with Mallard to assess the importance of intake rate as a cue to choose between patches associated with different foraging methods, and evaluate the influence of food depletion on the decision to switch between methods. When 50 g of wheat were presented in two patches, one at a depth of 5 cm and one at 35 cm, most of the foraging was in the shallow area. Reducing food abundance to 10 g in the shallow area led to an increase in deep foraging, although the birds still preferred the shallow area at the beginning of the tests despite the fact that it did not provide a higher intake rate. This area was used until complete depletion, and birds did not turn to deep foraging before ensuring that the shallow patch was empty. These results show that food depletion affects the choice between feeding patches hence foraging method. However the value of intake rate is not the main cue for decision, rather the birds appear to choose between patches with different methods on account of their respective costs.
919	10879905	Diagnosis of duck plague in waterfowl by polymerase chain reaction.	Hansen WR, Nashold SW, Docherty DE, Brown SE, Knudson DL	Avian Dis	 2000 Apr-Jun;44(2):266-74		A recently developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used for diagnosis of duck plague in waterfowl tissues from past and current cases of waterfowl mortality and to identify duck plague virus in combined cloacal/oral-pharyngeal swab samples from healthy mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) after a disease outbreak. The PCR was able to detect viral DNA from all the individual or pooled tissues assayed from 10 waterfowl, including liver and spleen samples from three Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata domesticus) that did not yield virus isolates. The strong staining intensity of the PCR products from the waterfowl tissues indicated that large amounts of virus were present, even when virus was not isolated. Duck plague DNA was also detected in a cloacal swab sample from a wood duck (Aix sponsa) carcass submitted for diagnosis. The PCR assay identified duck plague DNA in 13 swab samples that produced virus isolates from carrier mallards sampled in 1981 after a duck plague die-off. The duck plague PCR clearly demonstrated the ability to quickly diagnose duck plague in suspect mortality cases and to detect virus shed by carrier waterfowl.
920	10871425	Developmental toxicity of lead-contaminated sediment to mallard ducklings.	Hoffman DJ, Heinz GH, Sileo L, Audet DJ, Campbell JK, LeCaptain LJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2000 Aug;39(2):221-32	 doi: 101007/s002440010099	Sediment ingestion has been identified as an important exposure route for toxicants in waterfowl. The toxicity of lead-contaminated sediment from the Coeur d'Alene River Basin (CDARB) in Idaho was examined on posthatching development of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings for 6 weeks. Day-old ducklings received either untreated control diet, clean sediment (24%) supplemented control diet, CDARB sediment (3,449 microg/g lead) supplemented diets at 12% or 24%, or a positive control diet containing lead acetate equivalent to that found in 24% CDARB. The 12% CDARB diet resulted in a geometric mean blood lead concentration of 1.41 ppm (WW) with over 90% depression of red blood cell ALAD activity and over threefold elevation of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration. The 24% CDARB diet resulted in blood lead of 2.56 ppm with over sixfold elevation of protoporphyrin and lower brain weight. In this group the liver lead concentration was 7.92 ppm (WW), and there was a 40% increase in hepatic reduced glutathione concentration. The kidney lead concentration in this group was 7.97 ppm, and acid-fast inclusion bodies were present in the kidneys of four of nine ducklings. The lead acetate positive control group was more adversely affected in most respects than the 24% CDARB group. With a less optimal diet (mixture of two thirds corn and one third standard diet), CDARB sediment was more toxic; blood lead levels were higher, body growth and liver biochemistry (TBARS) were more affected, and prevalence of acid-fast inclusion bodies increased. Lead from CDARB sediment accumulated more readily in duckling blood and liver than reported in goslings, but at given concentrations was generally less toxic to ducklings. Many of these effects are similar to ones reported in wild mallards and geese within the CDARB.
921	10828844	Tissue-specific regulation of thyroid hormone receptor mRNA isoforms and target gene proteins in domestic ducks.	Bishop CM, McCabe CJ, Gittoes NJ, Butler PJ, Franklyn JA	J Endocrinol	 2000 Jun;165(3):607-15	 doi: 101677/joe01650607	Skeletal muscles are important target tissues for thyroid hormone action. The present study examines the influence of thyroid status on muscle growth and tissue-specific expression of thyroid receptor (TR) mRNA isoforms in a commercial strain of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Four groups (n=5) of 1-week-old ducklings were rendered either hypothyroid by treatment with methimazole (6 mg 100 g(-1) body mass or 12 mg 100 g(-1) body mass), or hyperthyroid by treatment with methimazole (6 mg 100 g(-1) body mass) in combination with thyroid hormones (5 microg thyroxine (T(4)) and tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) 100 g(-1) body mass or 10 microg T(4) and T(3) 100 g(-1) body mass). Serum and tissue samples (cardiac, pectoralis and semimembranosus leg muscle, liver, pituitary and cerebral cortex) were collected from these four groups, and from a group of untreated controls, at 8 weeks of age. Development of duckling morphology was retarded in methimazole-treated birds compared with that in euthyroid controls, as evidenced by differences in skeletal dimensions, primary feather length, and body and muscle masses. Body mass was lower by 18%, and relative masses of cardiac and pectoralis muscles were lower by 28% and 32% respectively. Heterologous oligonucleotides for TR alpha, TR beta 0, TR beta2 and the housekeeping gene beta-actin were derived from chicken sequences. RT-PCR showed that TR alpha mRNA was expressed in all tissues but was not significantly affected by any of the experimental treatments. TR beta 0 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the leg muscles of ducklings treated with 12 mg methimazole 100 g(-1) body mass (0.109+/-0.047 TR:beta-actin ratio, P<0.05) compared with that in euthyroid controls (0.380+/-0.202), but was unaltered in the pectoralis and cardiac muscles. Expression of TR beta 0 mRNA was significantly higher in pectoralis (by 3.5-fold, P<0. 05), cardiac (by 4.2-fold, P=0.003) and leg (by 4.0-fold, P<0.001) muscles of ducklings treated with thyroid hormones compared with those in euthyroid controls (0.098+/-0.019, 0.822+/-0.297 and 0. 38+/-0.202 TR:beta-actin respectively). Only the pituitary gland expressed significant levels of TR beta 2 mRNA.
922	10790508	Field evaluation of lead effects on Canada geese and mallards in the Coeur d'Alene River Basin, Idaho.	Henny CJ, Blus LJ, Hoffman DJ, Sileo L, Audet DJ, Snyder MR	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2000 Jul;39(1):97-112	 doi: 101007/s002440010085	Hatch year (HY) mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the Coeur d'Alene (CDA) River Basin had higher concentrations of lead in their blood than HY Western Canada geese (Branta canadensis moffitti) (geometric means 0.98 versus 0.28 microg/g, wet weight). The pattern for adults of both species was similar, although geometric means (1.77 versus 0. 41 microg/g) were higher than in HY birds. HY mallards captured in the CDA River Basin in 1987 contained significantly lower lead concentrations in their blood than in 1994-95 (0.36 versus 0.98 microg/g); however, some very young mallards were sampled in 1987, and concentrations in adults were not significantly different in 1987, 1994, or 1995 (1.52, 2.07, 1.55 microg/g, respectively). Both species in the CDA River Basin in 1994-95 showed significantly reduced red blood cell delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity compared to the reference areas: Canada geese (HY -65.4 to -86.0%, adults -82.3%), and mallards (HY -90.7 to -95.5%, adults -94. 1%). Canada goose goslings were divided into size classes, and the two smaller classes from the CDA River Basin had significantly elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (protoporphyrin) levels compared to the reference area (15.2x and 6.9x). HY and adult mallards both had significantly elevated protoporphyrin (5.9x and 7. 5x). Recognizing that interspecific differences exist in response and sensitivity to lead, it appears (at least for hemoglobin and hematocrit) that Canada geese were more sensitive to lead than mallards, i.e., adverse hematologic effects occur at lower blood lead concentrations. Only Canada geese from the CDA River Basin, in spite of lower blood lead concentrations, had significantly reduced mean hemoglobin and hematocrit values. No euthanized Canada geese (all HYs) from CDA River Basin were classified as clinically lead poisoned, but 38 Canada geese found dead in the CDA River Basin during a concurrent study succumbed to lead poisoning between 1992 and 1997. Only 6 (15.8%) of these 38 contained ingested lead shot, which contrasts greatly with the 75-94% incidence of ingested lead shot when mortality was due to lead shot ingestion. Lead from other contaminated sources (i.e., sediments and vegetation) in the CDA River Basin was strongly implicated in most Canada goose deaths. Based on the 31 live mallards and Canada geese collected in the CDA River Basin, which were representative of the live populations blood sampled only, the prevalence of subclinical and clinical lead poisoning (as determined by liver lead concentrations, excluding birds with ingested lead shot) was higher in mallards: subclinical (4 of 8, 50% HYs and 6 of 11, 55% adults); clinical (0% HYs and 4 of 11, 36% adults), with less data available for Canada geese (only 1 of 9, 11% HYs marginally subclinical). The clinically lead-poisoned mallards had extremely high concentrations of lead in blood (2.69-8. 82 microg/g) and liver (6.39-17.89 microg/g). Eight mallards found dead in the CDA River Basin during a concurrent study were diagnosed as lead poisoned, and only one (12.5%) contained ingested lead shot, which again strongly implicates other lead sources. The finding of dead lead poisoned Canada geese together with the high percentage of live mallards classified as subclinically or clinically lead poisoned, in combination with the low incidence of ingested lead shot causes us concern for both of these species, which live in association with lead-contaminated sediment in the CDA River Basin.
923	10787105	Strychnine alkaloid and avian reproduction: effects occur at lower dietary concentrations with mallard ducks than with bobwhite quail.	Pedersen CA, Sterner RT, Goodall MJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 2000 May;38(4):530-9	 doi: 101007/s002449910069	Separate subchronic reproductive toxicity studies were conducted using mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). Three groups (32/group; 16 male-female pairs) of 17-week-old ducks (F0 generation) were fed Purina Game Bird Breeder Layena diets containing mean (+/-SD) 33.2 (+/-2.7), 68.9 (+/-1.8), and 140.9 (+/-5.1) microg/g strychnine for 20 weeks, with some pairs in each group fed control diet during a subsequent 3-week recovery period. Three groups (32/group; 16 male-female pairs) of 19-week-old quail (F0 generation) were fed similar diets containing mean (+/-SD) 279.2 (+/-10.1), 557.4 (+/-43.5), and 1,113.6 (+/-46.6) microg/g strychnine for 22 weeks without a recovery period. Separate groups of ducks and quail (32/group; 16 male-female pairs) were also fed control diets (0.0 microg/g strychnine) in each study. There were 16 weekly collections of eggs for the mallard study (13 for the diet-exposure period and 3 for the recovery period), and 11 collections for the quail study. Eggs laid during the last 13 and 10 weeks of the diet-exposure periods for ducks (plus 3 weeks of the recovery period) and quail, respectively, were incubated. Each hatch of F1 generation ducklings and chicks was observed for 14 days. Key results were: (1) the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for F0 ducks and quail were 33.2 and 1,113.6 microg/g strychnine, respectively--quail showed no reproductive effects at the current doses; (2) decreased egg production and hatching success occurred for mallard hens fed mean 140.9 microg/g strychnine diets; and (3) "normal-hatching" ducklings from eggs of F0 mallards fed mean 140.9 microg/g strychnine diets suffered greater mortality than ducklings from the other diet groups. Possible mechanisms of strychnine action on avian reproduction are discussed.
924	10760740	Histology and ultrastructure of the chorioallantoic membrane of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lusimbo WS, Leighton FA, Wobeser GA	Anat Rec	 2000 May 1;259(1):25-34	 doi: 101002/(SICI)1097-0185(20000501)259:1<25::AID-AR3>30CO;2-Y	The histology and fine structure of the chorioallantoic membrane of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and the density of vessels per millimeter of membrane were assessed between days 12 and 24 of incubation. Light and transmission electron microscopy of the chorioallantoic membrane of the mallard duck after various days of incubation was carried out. Blood vessels within the mesoderm were counted per millimeter of membrane by light microscopy (40x). The chorioallantoic membrane had three distinct layers from day 12 to 24 of incubation, the chorionic epithelium, the mesoderm, and the allantoic epithelium. After day 12, chorionic epithelium consisted of two layers of flattened, elongated epithelial cells interfaced by numerous desmosomes, and separated from the underlying mesoderm by a basement membrane. At this stage, the allantoic epithelium consisted of a single layer of flattened, overlapping cells. Blood capillaries were observed in the mesoderm close to the chorionic epithelium on days 12 and 13; by day 14, these capillaries were located within the chorionic epithelium, forming a capillary sinus. Between days 14 and 16, the chorion underwent cellular and cytological differentiation into three cell types: capillary covering cells, villus cavity cells, and less differentiated basal cells. The mesoderm was composed of a loose matrix of mesenchymal cells and collagen fibrils through which coursed blood and lymphatic vessels. The vascular density in the mesoderm increased rapidly from 4.2+/-0.6 vessels per mm (n = 12) on day 12 to a maximum of 9.4+/-0.3 vessels per mm (n = 15) by day 16. From day 16, the allantoic epithelium had two to three layers of elongated and overlapping cells. The luminal layer of allantoic epithelial cells had microvillus projections and varying numbers of membrane-bound dense vesicles at all stages from day 12 onward. The histologic and ultrastructural features of mallard duck chorioallantoic membrane from day 12 to 24 of incubation were very similar to those described in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken (Gallus gallus) from day 8 to 20 of incubation. Much of the information available concerning the CAM of the chicken also may apply to the CAM of the mallard, with timing adjusted to match the developmental time-frame recorded here.
925	10760404	The effects of grit supplementation and feed type on steel-shot ingestion in mallards.	Mateo R, Guitart R	Prev Vet Med	 2000 Apr 28;44(3-4):221-9	 doi: 101016/s0167-5877(00)00101-x	Lead poisoning by shot-pellet ingestion is an important cause of death in waterfowl from wetlands that have high densities of lead-shot pellets and low availabilities of grit in their sediments. To evaluate grit supplementation when mixed with baited grain as a method of reducing shot ingestion in waterfowl, 24 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were kept in captivity to study the relationship between steel-shot, grit and grain ingestion in four experiments. Steel-shot ingestion was more related to seeking grit than to feeding on grain, and it did not differ between two types of grain offered (rice or sorghum). Grit ingestion increased with grit supplementation and shot ingestion was only slightly reduced. Calcareous grit used in the experiments had a shorter half-life (1.4 days) in the gizzard than values reported for siliceous grit (3.1 days).
926	19184795	The use of conventional radiography and computer-assisted tomography as instruments for demonstration of gross pathological lesions in the cranium and cerebrum in the crested breed of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f.dom.).	Bartels T, Krautwald-Junghanns ME, Portmann S, Brinkmeier J, Kummerfeld N, Sohn HG, Dorsch B	Avian Pathol	 2000 Apr;29(2):101-8	 doi: 101080/03079450094126	According to literature reports, the crested breed of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) is described as a variety with high pre- and post-natal mortalities, malformations in skull and brain anatomy, and various central nervous deficiencies in affected birds. A detailed examination as to the cause and pathogenesis of these neurologic disorders has not yet been conducted, nor has an explanation concerning the inheritance of the feather crest been found. By using two non-invasive radiographic techniques, conventional radiography and computer-assisted tomography, living ducks were examined. Our studies have demonstrated that brain and skull anatomy of ducks of various breeds (Crested, Abacot Ranger, and German Pekin) can be well visualized using computer-assisted tomography. The Crested ducks investigated in this study showed abnormal fatty tissue deposits in the tentorium cerebelli, cranial malformations, and variable bone formations in the thickened hypodermis of the crest. In comparison with computer-assisted tomography, only parts of the skull changes were detected with conventional radiography; in no case could fat bodies be seen with this imaging method. An increase of the cranial capacity in the Crested ducks compared with other breeds examined (Abacot Ranger, German Pekin ducks) was found in morphometric studies carried out by computerassisted tomography. This increase of cranial capacity in Crested ducks results from an increase of the tentorial fatty depot during craniogenesis, as an enlargement of the fat body can influence cranium growth as long as the cranial bones are not yet fused. Thus, in comparison with other phenotypically similar domesticated birds like the crested chicken, the expression of the feather crest in domestic ducks demonstrates symptomatologic differences.
927	10734378	Factors affecting reproductive performance in captive Mallard ducks.	Stunden CE, Bluhm CK, Cheng KM, Rajamahendran R	Theriogenology	 1999 Aug;52(3):435-46	 doi: 101016/S0093-691X(99)00141-7	Propagation of wild-strain Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in captivity is hindered by low egg fertility. Therefore, we studied the effects of captivity, age, mate choice and isolation on reproductive parameters of Mallards. Captive drakes had smaller immature testes than free-flying Mallard drakes. Captive yearling ducks weighed less than adult ducks at the beginning of the breeding season, but no differences were found between their initial clutch size, egg volume or number of clutches laid. Yearling pairs had lower egg fertility (7%) than adult pairs (80%). Egg fertility was higher (51 vs 21%) in self-chosen pairs than in randomly assigned pairs. Isolation of ducks, however did not influence egg production.
928	10716444	Egg investment is influenced by male attractiveness in the mallard.	Cunningham EJ, Russell AF	Nature	 2000 Mar 2;404(6773):74-7	 doi: 101038/35003565	Why females prefer to copulate with particular males is a contentious issue. Attention is currently focused on whether females choose males on the basis of their genetic quality, in order to produce more viable offspring. Support for this hypothesis in birds has come from studies showing that preferred males tend to father offspring of better condition or with increased survivorship. Before attributing greater offspring viability to a male's heritable genetic quality, however, it is important to discount effects arising from confounding sources, including maternal effects. This has generally been addressed by comparing offspring viability from two different breeding attempts by the same female: one when offspring are sired by a preferred male, and one when offspring are sired by a less preferred male. However, here we show that individual female mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) lay larger eggs after copulating with preferred males and smaller eggs after copulating with less preferred males. As a result, females produced offspring of better body condition when paired with preferred males. After controlling for these differences in maternal investment, we found no effect of paternity on offspring condition. This shows that differences between half-sibs cannot always be attributed to paternal or maternal genetic effects.
929	28308352	Nesting mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) forecast brood-stage food limitation when selecting habitat: experimental evidence.	Poysa H, Elmberg J, Sjoberg K, Nummi P	Oecologia	 2000 Mar;122(4):582-586	 doi: 101007/PL00008858	By combining and reanalysing data from two independent field experiments we explore whether food limitation at the brood stage affects habitat selection in nesting mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). In an introduction experiment we found that, independent of treatment, some study lakes remained empty of wild mallard pairs ("empty lakes"), whereas on other lakes introduced birds attracted wild mallards ("attractive lakes"). In the other experiment we used mallard ducklings to address brood-stage food limitation by studying mass change of ducklings. We found that ducklings foraging on lakes that did not attract wild mallard pairs in the introduction experiment gained much less mass than those foraging on attractive lakes. In most cases ducklings even lost mass in the empty-lake foraging trials, providing strong evidence for food limitation. Therefore, lakes that remained empty of wild mallard pairs in the introduction experiment proved to be inferior brood habitats, particularly in terms of food. Our results give insight into the mechanisms underlying the general habitat selection hypotheses, specifically the ideal preemptive and conspecific attraction rules. The results further support our earlier conclusion that mallards do not use the ideal preemptive rule when selecting nesting lakes. However, conspecific attraction may not be generally applicable either, because, independent of the presence of introduced conspecifics, wild mallards somehow anticipated the low quality of the empty lakes as brood-rearing habitats and made their habitat-selection decision accordingly.
930	10682752	Influence of diet on the hematology and serum biochemistry of zinc-intoxicated mallards.	Levengood JM, Sanderson GC, Anderson WL, Foley GL, Brown PW, Seets JW	J Wildl Dis	 2000 Jan;36(1):111-23	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-361111	Changes in hematological and serum biochemistry parameters in female zinc (Zn)-dosed farm-raised mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) fed four different diets were examined. Sixty ducks received an average dose of 0.97 g of Zn in the form of eight, 3.30-mm diameter shot pellets containing 98% Zn and 2% tin, and another 60 ducks were sham-dosed as controls. Fifteen ducks from each of the two dosing groups were assigned to one of four dietary treatments: corn only, corn with soil, commercial duck ration only, or commercial duck ration with soil. Shot-pellet dissolution rates ranged from 7 mg/Zn/day to 27 mg/Zn/day. Regardless of diet, the Zn dose resulted in mortality; incoordination; paralysis and anorexia; decreased body, liver, pancreas, gonad, and gizzard weight; increased kidney weight; and macroscopic lesions. Zn-dosed ducks had a lower mean erythrocyte packed cell volume (PCV), higher mean reticulocyte count, and a greater number of individuals with immature and/or abnormal erythrocytes, than did control mallards. Mean total leucocyte counts were higher in Zn-dosed ducks than in controls. Zn-dosed ducks that had soil available had higher leucocyte counts than those without soil. Zn-dosed ducks were characterized by a marked heterophilia and relative lymphopenia. In Zn-dosed ducks, the mean lymphocyte count was highest in those provided a commercial duck ration, and lowest in those fed corn. In control ducks, the mean lymphocyte count was highest in ducks fed corn, and lowest in those provided soil along with a commercial duck ration. Zn-dosed mallards had higher serum aspartate aminotransferase and amylase levels, and lower alkaline phosphatase activities than control ducks. Serum phosphorus and uric acid concentrations were higher, and calcium, glucose, and total protein levels lower, in Zn-dosed ducks than in control ducks. Diet did affect serum calcium, phosphorus, total protein, and uric acid concentrations. Differences in erythrocyte and leucocyte parameters, serum enzyme activities, and metabolite concentrations were associated with dose and diet effects. Diets high in protein and other organic matter and calcium and phosphorus did not prevent or substantially alleviate Zn toxicosis in farm-raised mallard ducks.
931	10681098	Effect of cadmium on Pekin duck total body water, water flux, renal filtration, and salt gland function.	Bennett DC, Hughes MR, Elliott JE, Scheuhammer AM, Smits JE	J Toxicol Environ Health A	 2000 Jan 14;59(1):43-56	 doi: 101080/009841000157069	The following hypotheses were examined using Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) as a model for marine ducks: cadmium (Cd) intake affects (1) salt gland and/or kidney function of ducks and (2) osmoregulation differently in male and female ducks. Birds were fed 0, 50, or 300 microg Cd/g food. They were gradually acclimated to 450 mM NaCl and then drank 300 mM NaCl for 3 mo while salt gland secretion (SGS), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), total body water (TBW), and water flux (WF) were measured in ducks eating control and high-Cd diets. Cadmium ingestion did not markedly affect body mass, but significantly enlarged the salt glands and kidneys. Enhancement of kidney mass was greater in males. Cadmium ingestion did not affect TBW or WF, but tended to increase interstitial fluid space at the expense of intracellular fluid. Sex did not affect TBW, but males had greater WF. Birds that ate Cd diets, especially the higher Cd diet, exhibited renal tubular damage and lower GFR. Ducks that ate Cd had lower plasma sodium concentration and osmolality and, to activate SGS, required longer infusion of NaCl and larger increments
932	10633919	Trichobilharzia regenti, a pathogen of the avian and mammalian central nervous systems.	Horak P, Dvorak J, Kolarova L, Trefil L	Parasitology	 1999 Dec;119 ( Pt 6):577-81	 doi: 101017/s0031182099005132	The development of nasal avian schistosomes of the genus Trichobilharzia in their final host is poorly known. Therefore, an experimental infection of ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.) by T. regenti was performed. The infection resulted in leg paralysis and orientation/balance disorders of birds. The examination of the duck's spinal cord and brain confirmed the presence of developing parasites in pre-patent as well as patent periods. The absence of the worms in other tissues strongly supports our hypothesis that the parasite migrates through the central nervous system (CNS) to its final location in bird nasal mucosa. The injury level is probably dependent on number of parasites as well as yet unknown host factors. The affinity to the CNS seems to be high; also by exposure of experimental animals to low cercarial doses the growing worms in the CNS were found. In addition to the generally accepted view that bird schistosomes may cause cercarial dermatitis of mammals (including man), there is evidence of a partial development of T. regenti in mouse CNS; in certain cases leg paralysis was also recorded. Therefore, the pathogenesis spectrum caused by bird schistosomes in birds/mammals needs to be reconsidered.
933	10609050	The innervation of the ureter in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). A morphological and quantitative study.	Mirabella N, Paino G, Germano G, Pelagalli GV	Ann Anat	 1999 Dec;181(6):537-44	 doi: 101016/S0940-9602(99)80058-2	The morphology and distribution of the innervation in the duck ureter were studied using AChE histochemistry and PGP 9.5 immunohistochemistry. The density of AChE positive ganglia and neurons was calculated in the adventitial and muscular layers both in young and adult birds. Moreover, in order to investigate regional differences in neuronal density, separate neuron counts and neuron density calculations were performed for the upper, intermediate and lower parts of the ureter, and the data were statistically evaluated. Three nerve plexuses located in the tunica adventitia, in the tunica muscularis and in the lamina propria respectively, were observed. Both in young and adult ducks, the density of adventitial neurons was significantly greater in the lower tract than in the upper and intermediate tracts. The findings of the present study suggest that, in birds, the innervation may play a role in ureteric functions such as epithelial mucosecretion, muscular motility, and closure and/or opening of the ureteric papilla.
934	10603329	Metabolic response to air temperature and wind in day-old mallards and a standard operative temperature scale.	Bakken GS, Reynolds PS, Kenow KP, Korschgen CE, Boysen AF	Physiol Biochem Zool	 1999 Nov-Dec;72(6):656-65	 doi: 101086/316704	Most duckling mortality occurs during the week following hatching and is often associated with cold, windy, wet weather and scattering of the brood. We estimated the thermoregulatory demands imposed by cold, windy weather on isolated 1-d-old mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings resting in cover. We measured O2 consumption and evaporative water loss at air temperatures from 5 degrees to 25 degrees C and wind speeds of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 m/s. Metabolic heat production increased as wind increased or temperature decreased but was less sensitive to wind than that of either adult passerines or small mammals. Evaporative heat loss ranged from 5% to 17% of heat production. Evaporative heat loss and the ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production was significantly lower in rest phase. These data were used to define a standard operative temperature (Tes) scale for night or heavy overcast conditions. An increase of wind speed from 0.1 to 1 m/s decreased Tes by 3 degrees -5 degrees C.

Martinez R, Wobeser G	J Wildl Dis	 1999 Oct;35(4):710-5	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-354710	A single subcutaneous immunization with a vaccine used for protecting ranch mink (Mustela vison) against type C botulism reduced morbidity and mortality in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail (Anas acuta) ducks challenged with approximately 4.5 x 10(4) and 2.25 x 10(4) mouse lethal doses (MLD50), respectively, of botulinum toxin at 10 and 15 days post-immunization (pi). There was no significant protection at 5 days pi. Protection persisted in mallards for 90 days pi. To simulate use of vaccine as a part of treatment of sick birds in the field, mallards were exposed to toxin and, when clinical signs were evident, each bird was treated by intraperitoneal injection of type C botulinum antitoxin and one-half of the birds were immunized. Immunization had no significant effect on recovery from intoxication. At 10 days posttreatment, all birds were challenged with toxin. Clinical signs and mortality were significantly less frequent among immunized birds than among non-immunized birds after the second exposure. Immunization might be useful as part of the treatment regimen in botulism outbreaks.
936	10563490	Facultative control of avian unihemispheric sleep under the risk of predation.	Rattenborg NC, Lima SL, Amlaner CJ	Behav Brain Res	 1999 Nov 15;105(2):163-72	 doi: 101016/s0166-4328(99)00070-4	Birds and aquatic mammals are the only taxonomic groups known to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep (USWS). In aquatic mammals, USWS permits sleep and breathing to occur concurrently in water. However, the function of avian USWS has been unclear. Our study is based on the premise that avian USWS serves a predator detection function, since the eye contralateral to the awake hemisphere remains open during USWS. If USWS functions as a form of predator detection, then birds should be able to control both the proportion of slow-wave sleep composed of USWS and the orientation of the open eye in response to changes in predation risk. To test these predictions we recorded eye state and the EEG of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) sleeping in groups of four birds arranged in a row. Birds at the ends of the row were more exposed than those in the central positions, who were flanked on both sides by other birds, and thus should perceive a greater risk of predation. Consistent with a predator detection function, when compared to birds in the group's center, birds at the exposed ends of the row showed a 150% increase in USWS and a preference for directing the open eye away from the group, the direction from which a predator is most likely to approach. Furthermore, during USWS mallards responded rapidly to threatening visual stimuli presented to the open eye. This ability to facultatively control sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain probably involves the neuroanatomical interhemispheric separation responsible for independent hemispheric functioning during wakefulness in birds.
937	10562453	Melatonin receptors and melatonin inhibition of duck salt gland secretion.	Ching AC, Hughes MR, Poon AM, Pang SF	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1999 Nov;116(2):229-40	 doi: 101006/gcen19997362	Most of the NaCl ingested by marine birds is reabsorbed from renal filtrate and excreted by the cephalic salt glands as a hypertonic NaCl secretion (SGS). Ducks have salt glands and their kidney cells have melatonin receptors. Melatonin affects glomerular filtration rate and tubular uptake of sodium (Na(+)) in mammals. We hypothesized that (1) duck salt glands also have melatonin receptors and (2) melatonin affects extrarenal Na(+) secretion. Both hypotheses were accepted because putative melatonin receptors were identified by 2 inverted question mark(125)Iiodomelatonin binding in salt glands of Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, and because melatonin inhibited SGS in these ducks. Saline ingestion increased B(max), but not K(d), of salt gland receptors. The duration of NaCl infusion needed to stimulate SGS was positively related with preinfusion plasma melatonin concentration ( inverted question markmel(pl)). Raising inverted question markmel(pl) prior to NaCl infusion further delayed onset of secretion and decreased secretion rate and concentration without affecting plasma volume and Na(+) concentration. Abrupt increase in inverted question markmel(pl) during SGS immediately decreased the rate by 43%. Secretion rate remained lower than the control rate during the subsequent hour; secretion concentration was not affected. This is the first report of putative melatonin binding sites in avian salt glands. Melatonin slowed the onset of NaCl-induced salt gland secretion and decreased its rate.
938	10216767	The effect of route of inoculation on the virulence of raptorial Pasteurella multocida isolates in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Pehlivanoglu F, Morishita TY, Aye PP, Porter RE Jr, Angrick EJ, Harr BS, Nersessian B	Avian Dis	 1999 Jan-Mar;43(1):116-21		The purpose of this study was to determine the virulence of raptorial Pasteurella multocida for ducks and the effect of various routes of inoculation on virulence. Four-week-old Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were challenged with one of three raptorial isolates (RTHA-2, RTHA-4, or WESO-1) by one of five inoculation routes (intranasal, intraocular, intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous). Ducks were monitored daily for mortality until 2 wk postchallenge. Results indicated that the intravenous route caused the most mortality for all isolates and that significant variation existed in the virulence among the sources of P. multocida, with WESO-1 causing the least mortality of the isolates tested.
939	10190055	Identification of in vitro cytochrome P450 modulators to detect induction by prototype inducers in the mallard duckling (Anas platyrhynchos).	Renauld AE, Melancon MJ, Sordillo LM	Comp Biochem Physiol C Pharmacol Toxicol Endocrinol	 1999 Feb;122(2):273-81	 doi: 101016/s0742-8413(98)10119-6	Seven modulators of mammalian monooxygenase activity were screened for their ability to selectively stimulate or inhibit in vitro monooxygenase activities of hepatic microsomes from mallard ducklings treated with phenobarbital, beta-naphthoflavone, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl or vehicle. Microsomes were assayed fluorometrically for four monooxygenases: benzyloxy-, ethoxy-, methoxy-, and pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase, in combination with each of the seven modulators. Four combinations: alpha-naphthoflavone and 2-methylbenzimidazole with benzyloxyresorufin, and Proadifen with methoxy- and ethoxyresorufin, respectively, were evaluated further. beta-Naphthoflavone-treated groups were clearly distinguished from the corn oil vehicle control group by all of the assays and by the effects of the modulators in three of the four assay/modulator combinations. Enzyme activities of the phenobarbital and saline groups were statistically similar (P > or = 0.05) when assayed without modulator added, but each assay/modulator combination distinguished between these groups. The PCB-treated group was distinguished from the corn oil vehicle control group only for BROD activity, with or without the presence of modulator. Graphing of per cent modulation of BROD activity versus initial BROD activity provided the clearest distinction between all of the study groups. Identification of these selective in vitro modulators may improve detection and measurement of low level cytochrome P450 induction in avian species. Also, both the monooxygenase activities induced and the impacts of the modulators indicated differences between mammalian and avian cytochromes P450.
940	10099952	A crossed projection from the optic tectum to craniocervical premotor areas in the brainstem reticular formation. An anterograde and retrograde tracing study in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Tellegen AJ, Karssen AM, Rietveld TM, Dubbeldam JL	Eur J Morphol	 1998 Dec;36(4-5):227-43	 doi: 101076/ejom3642275823	The optic tectum in birds receives visual information from the contralateral retina. This information is passed through to other brain areas via the deep layers of the optic tectum. In the present study the crossed tectobulbar pathway is described in detail. This pathway forms the connection between the optic tectum and the premotor area of craniocervical muscles in the contralateral paramedian reticular formation. It originates predominantly from neurons in the ventromedial part of stratum griseum centrale and to a lesser extent from stratum album centrale. The fibers leave the tectum as a horizontal fiber bundle, and cross the midline through the caudal radix oculomotorius and rostral nucleus oculomotorius. On the contralateral side fibers turn to ventral and descend caudally in the contralateral paramedian reticular formation to the level of the obex. Labeled terminals are found in the ipsilateral medial mesencephalic reticular formation lateral to the radix and motor nucleus of the oculomotor nerve, and in the contralateral paramedian reticular formation, along the descending tract. Neurons in the medial mesencephalic reticular formation in turn project to the paramedian reticular formation. Through the crossed tectobulbar pathway visual information can influence the activity of craniocervical muscles via reticular premotor neurons.
941	10076926	Location of reticular premotor areas of a motor center innervating craniocervical muscles in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Tellegen AJ, Dubbeldam JL	J Comp Neurol	 1999 Mar 15;405(3):281-98	 doi: 101002/(sici)1096-9861(19990315)405:3<281::aid-cne1>30co;2-y	The supraspinal nucleus (SSp) in the mallard, which lies in the rostral spinal cord and caudal brainstem, is a motor nucleus that forms the rostral continuation of the ventral horn. It contains part of the motoneurons innervating the craniocervical muscles. Injections with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to HRP (WGA) in the SSp were used to localize the craniocervical premotor neurons in the medullary reticular formation. A mixture of WGA and HRP (WGA/HRP) or biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were injected in the different reticular areas to test the results. Small numbers of craniocervical premotor neurons were found bilaterally in the ventromedial part of the parvocellular reticular formation (RPcvm) and in the caudal extension of RPcvm, the nucleus centralis dorsalis of the medulla oblongata, and the gigantocellular reticular formation (RGc). In a second series of experiments, WGA/HRP and BDA injections in these reticular areas were used to visualize afferent fibers and terminals in the SSp. The combination of the two types of experiments shows that RPcvm and RGc contain modest numbers of craniocervical premotor neurons. Because the reticular formation also contains jaw and tongue premotor neurons and receives a variety of sensory projections, the present results suggest that the medullary reticular formation plays a role in the coordination of complex movements (e.g., feeding). The pattern of afferent and efferent connections of the reticular formation is used to redefine its subdivisions in the myelencephalon of the mallard.
942	10047601	Toxicity of lead-contaminated sediment to mallards.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, Sileo L, Audet DJ, LeCaptain LJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1999 Apr;36(3):323-33	 doi: 101007/s002449900478	Because consumption of lead-contaminated sediment has been suspected as the cause of waterfowl mortality in the Coeur d'Alene River basin in Idaho, we studied the bioavailability and toxicity of this sediment to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). In experiment 1, one of 10 adult male mallards died when fed a pelleted commercial duck diet that contained 24% lead-contaminated sediment (with 3,400 microgram/g lead in the sediment). Protoporphyrin levels in the blood increased as the percentage of lead-contaminated sediment in the diet increased. Birds fed 24% lead-contaminated sediment exhibited atrophy of the breast muscles, green staining of the feathers around the vent, viscous bile, green staining of the gizzard lining, and renal tubular intranuclear inclusion bodies. Mallards fed 24% lead-contaminated sediment had means of 6.1 microgram/g of lead in the blood and 28 microgram/g in the liver (wet-weight basis) and 1,660 microgram/g in the feces (dry-weight basis). In experiment 2, we raised the dietary concentration of the lead-contaminated sediment to 48%, but only about 20% sediment was actually ingested due to food washing by the birds. Protoporphyrin levels were elevated in the lead-exposed birds, and all of the mallards fed 48% lead-contaminated sediment had renal tubular intranuclear inclusion bodies. The concentrations of lead in the liver were 9.1 microgram/g for mallards fed 24% lead-contaminated sediment and 16 microgram/g for mallards fed 48% lead-contaminated sediment. In experiment 3, four of five mallards died when fed a ground corn diet containing 24% lead-contaminated sediment (with 4,000 microgram/g lead in this sample of sediment), but none died when the 24% lead-contaminated sediment was mixed into a nutritionally balanced commercial duck diet; estimated actual ingestion rates for sediment were 14% and 17% for the corn and commercial diets. Lead exposure caused elevations in protoporphyrin, and four of the five mallards fed 24% lead-contaminated sediment in a commercial diet and all five fed the contaminated sediment in a corn diet had renal intranuclear inclusion bodies. Lead was higher in the livers of mallards fed 24% lead-contaminated sediment in the corn diet (38 microgram/g) than in the commercial diet (13 microgram/g).
943	10047600	Acute toxicity and sublethal effects of white phosphorus in mute swans, Cygnus olor.	Sparling DW, Day D, Klein P	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1999 Apr;36(3):316-22	 doi: 101007/s002449900477	Among the waterfowl affected by white phosphorus (P4) at a military base in Alaska are tundra (Cygnus columbianus) and trumpeter (C. buccinator) swans. To estimate the toxicity of P4 to swans and compare the toxic effects to those of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), we dosed 30 juvenile mute swans (C. olor) with 0 to 5.28 mg P4/kg body weight. The calculated LD50 was 3.65 mg/kg (95% CI: 1.40 to 4. 68 mg/kg). However, many of the swans still had P4 in their gizzards after dying, as determined by "smoking gizzards" and characteristic odor, and a lower LD50 might be calculated if all of the P4 had passed into the small intestines. We attribute the retention of P4 in swans to the possibility that P4 pellets were mistaken for the similarly sized grit in their gizzards. Most swans took 1 to 4.5 days to die in contrast to the few hours normally required in mallards and death appeared to be related more to liver dysfunction than to hemolysis. White phosphorus affected several plasma constituents, most notably elevated aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase.

Bebout DE, Hempleman SC	Am J Physiol	 1999 Feb;276(2):R317-22	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19992762R317	Avian intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) are vagal sensory neurons that participate in the control of breathing. IPC action potential frequency is inversely proportional to PCO2, but it is unclear whether low PCO2 or high pH is the immediate stimulus for signal transduction in IPC. To address this question, comparisons were made between single cell neural responses of 34 IPC recorded in 6 anesthetized ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) acclimatized 12 days to 7.5% inspired CO2 and 22 IPC recorded in 9 normal anesthetized ducks. We hypothesized that if respiratory-linked pH changes determine IPC activity, action potential frequency as a function of inspiratory PCO2 (PICO2) should be greater after acclimatization due to metabolic acid-base compensation and higher pH. Conversely, if PCO2 alone determines IPC discharge, action potential frequency vs. PCO2 should be unchanged by acclimatization. Results indicate that after acclimatization ventilation was depressed at 28 and 42 Torr PICO2 (P < 0.05) and mean plasma pH at 40 Torr PCO2 increased from 7.38 +/- 0. 03 to 7.56 +/- 0.02 (P < 0.05), indicating significant metabolic acid-base compensation and HCO-3 retention. Mean IPC discharge rate was elevated by CO2 acclimatization at all PCO2 studied. In acclimatized vs. normal animals, regression analysis of IPC discharge as a function of lnPCO2 showed increased mean intercepts of 81.1 +/- 4.0 vs. 48.4 +/- 3.6 impulses/s (P < 0.05) and increased mean slopes of -19.0 +/- 1.0 vs. -12.0 +/- 1.1 impulses. s-1. lnPCO2-1 (P < 0.05). Results indicate that IPC response to CO2 is mediated by H+ from CO2 hydration and not by CO2 directly.
945	9879557	Trichobilharzia regenti n. sp. (Schistosomatidae, Bilharziellinae), a new nasal schistosome from Europe.	Horak P, Kolarova L, Dvorak J	Parasite	 1998 Dec;5(4):349-57	 doi: 101051/parasite/1998054349	Members of the genus Trichobilharzia are parasitic in visceral or nasal body parts of their avian hosts. The examination of water snails in South Bohemia revealed a schistosome infection in Radix peregra snails. The experimental infection of ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos, Cairina moschata) confirmed that a new Trichobilharzia species--T. regenti n. sp.--was found. The adults, eggs and larvae (miracidia and cercariae) of the species were morphologically characterized. The adult occupy the nasal blood vessels where they lay the eggs; the miracidia hatch from the eggs directly in the tissue and leave the host during drinking/feeding of the infected birds.
946	9551481	The structure of the interstitial tissue of the active and resting avian testis.	Aire TA	Onderstepoort J Vet Res	 1997 Dec;64(4):291-9		The interstitial tissue of the testis was studied in gonadally active and gonadally inactive domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), guinea-fowl (Numida meleagris), duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Gonadal inactivity in the fowl was induced by a single subcutaneous injection of 50 mg oestradiol benzoate. The structure of this tissue was similar in all the birds studied. Lymphatic vessels were mostly thin and meandered between the peritubular tissue peripherally and the centrally located blood vessels, Leydig cells and macrophages. The basal lamina rested on a closely associated homogeneous microfibrillar layer free of collagen fibres. The myofibroblast layer was several cells thick, and quite compact. The basal lamina of gonadally resting birds was highly irregular, relatively electron-dense, contained electron-lucent globules, and sent numerous finger-like processes or plicae into the seminiferous epithelium, particularly into the Sertoli cells. The Leydig cells were few but typical in structure. In gonadally inactive birds they accumulated lipid droplets, dense heterogeneous bodies, probably lysosomes, and appeared to degenerate. The avian testicular interstitium is similar to that of the human and cat in possessing a multi-layered myofibroblast component, and to that of the rodent in possessing a small number of Leydig cells, as well as in the location of the lymphatic vessels. Thus the bird combines characteristics of the interstitium found variably in mammals.
947	9813837	Effects of lead, iron, and bismuth alloy shot embedded in the breast muscles of game-farm mallards.	Sanderson GC, Anderson WL, Foley GL, Havera SP, Skowron LM, Brawn JW, Taylor GD, Seets JW	J Wildl Dis	 1998 Oct;34(4):688-97	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-344688	Effects of five lead (Pb), iron (Fe), or bismuth (Bi)/tin (Sn) alloy shot embedded in the breast muscles of game-farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were studied from 28 March 1994 through 27 March 1995. We detected no differences in the mean survival times, mean hematocrits, or mean body weights among the three shot types. Connective tissue encapsulated Pb and Bi/Sn shot but only slight changes occurred in tissues surrounding the shot. Recovered Pb and Bi/Sn shot were essentially unchanged in appearance and weight. A thin zone of "oxide" surrounded Fe shot with a slight inflammatory response and a small amount of scarring adjacent to the embedded shot. Fe shot decreased slightly in weight while embedded. Bacterial infections were absent in all dosed ducks. Mean weights of kidneys, livers, and gonads did not vary by type of shot. Kidneys and livers of Bi-dosed ducks had higher concentrations of Bi than in Pb- and Fe-dosed ducks. Muscle and blood showed no differences in Bi concentrations among doses. We found no histological dose-related effects in kidneys, liver, and gonads from the embedded shot.
948	9813836	Acute effects of lead, steel, tungsten-iron, and tungsten-polymer shot administered to game-farm mallards.	Kelly ME, Fitzgerald SD, Aulerich RJ, Balander RJ, Powell DC, Stickle RL, Stevens W, Cray C, Tempelman RJ, Bursian SJ	J Wildl Dis	 1998 Oct;34(4):673-87	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-344673	Sixteen-bird groups (sexes equal) of adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were orally dosed with eight #4 steel short, eight #4 lead shot, eight BB-size tungsten-iron shot, eight BB-size tungsten-polymer shot, or were sham-dosed and maintained for 30 days (16 January 1996 to 15 February 1996). Half of the lead-dosed ducks (five males, three females) died during the study, whereas no ducks died in the other dosage groups. For lead-dosed ducks, hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration were decreased on day 15 of the trial, but not on day 30. Delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity in lead-dosed ducks was lower when compared to steel-dosed ducks only. Plasma activities of selected enzymes were elevated in lead-dosed ducks when compared to enzyme activities of ducks in the other groups. For lead-dosed ducks, relative heart, liver, and kidney weights increased in comparison to relative weights of those organs of ducks in other groups. Histology of tissues indicated that renal nephrosis accompanied by biliary stasis was present in the eight lead-dosed ducks that died. For the eight lead-dosed ducks that survived, six had mild to severe biliary stasis. Mild biliary stasis was noted in five tungsten-iron dosed ducks and three tungsten-polymer dosed ducks. Amounts of lead in the femur, liver, and kidneys were higher in lead-dosed ducks than in ducks of the other four groups. Small amounts of tungsten were detected in the femur and kidneys of two tungsten-polymer dosed ducks. Higher concentrations of tungsten were detected in the femur, liver, and kidneys of all tungsten-iron dosed ducks. The rate of shot erosion was highest (80%) for the tungsten-polymer shot, followed by tungsten-iron (55%), lead (50%), and steel shot (33%). Results indicated that tungsten-iron or tungsten-polymer shot (8 shot/duck) orally administered to mallards did not adversely affect them during a 30-day trial.
949	9755048	In vivo and in vitro induction of c-fos in avian exocrine salt gland cells.	Hildebrandt JP, Gerstberger R, Schwarz M	Am J Physiol	 1998 Oct;275(4):C951-7	 doi: 101152/ajpcell19982754C951	Osmotic stress in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) results in salt secretion and adaptive cell proliferation and differentiation in the nasal glands. We investigated whether osmotic stress in vivo or muscarinic ACh receptor activation in vitro changed the expression levels of the cellular protooncogene products Fos and Jun, which may play a role in the initiation of the adaptive processes. Using Fos- and Jun-specific polyclonal antisera in Western blot experiments, we demonstrated that Jun is constitutively expressed in nasal gland tissue, whereas Fos is not detectable in tissue from unstressed (naive) animals. Under conditions of osmotic stress imposed by replacing the drinking water of the animals with a 1% NaCl solution, Jun protein remains constant in nasal gland tissue, whereas Fos protein is transiently upregulated. Treatment of cultured nasal gland tissue with muscarinic agonists results in a transcriptionally regulated expression of Fos in an atropine-sensitive manner. Immunohistochemical experiments show that Fos accumulation occurs in the nuclei of the secretory cells. These results indicate that the activation of the c-fos gene induced by muscarinic ACh receptor-mediated signaling pathways may play an important role in the initiation of adaptive growth and differentiation processes in nasal glands of osmotically stressed ducklings.
950	9741146	The morphology of the ureter in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Mirabella N, Esposito V, Corona M, Pelagalli GV	Anat Histol Embryol	 1998 Aug;27(4):237-43	 doi: 101111/j1439-02641998tb00187x	The morphology of the ureter of the duck was investigated, using histological, SEM and TEM techniques. The inner perimeter, the total thickness of the ureteral wall and the thickness of each uretral layer were measured. The epithelium was tall columnar and pseudostratified along all the tracts of the ureter and showed a high muco-secretive activity. The lamina propria contained numerous capillaries and aggregates of leucocytes and macrophages. Throughout the lamina propria there was a dense plexus of nerves. Some denuded single nerve fibres were observed between the epithelial basal cells. A plexus of nerves was also observed in the tunica muscularis. The ostium cloacale ureteris opened on a well-developed papilla in the dorsal region of the urodeum. The total thickness of the ureteral wall, the thickness of the lamina propria and the tunica muscularis, and the inner perimeter progressively increased towards the ostium. The above observations suggest that the avian ureter plays an important role in the modification of the urine coming from medullary cones, and in emission of the urine into the cloaca.
951	9732483	Subchronic dietary toxicity of strychnine: bobwhite quail are less sensitive than mallard ducks.	Sterner RT, Pedersen CA, Helsten BR, Goodall MJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1998 Oct;35(3):498-505	 doi: 101007/s002449900408	Separate, 28-day, subchronic studies of strychnine dietary toxicity were conducted using northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Five groups (five males five females/group) of 29-week-old quail were fed Purina(R) Game Bird Breeder Layena(R) diets containing mean (+/-SD) 484.2 (+/-17.0), 972. 6 (+/-54.0), 1,870.8 (+/-176.1), 3,516.7 (+/-68.0), and 6,083.3 (+/-269.6) microgram/g strychnine; whereas five groups of 27-week-old mallards (five males five females/group) were fed similar diets containing mean (+/-SD) 18.8 (+/-1.3), 91.1 (+/-27.3), 235.0 (+/-33. 8), 484.2 (+/-17.0), and 972.6 (+/-54.0) microgram/g strychnine. Separate "vehicle control" (0.0 microgram/g strychnine) groups (five males, five females/group) were included in each study. Strychnine toxicity was much less pronounced in quail; no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) were 972.6 (+/-54.0) and 91.1 (+/-27.3) microgram/g strychnine for quail and ducks, respectively. Several possible explanations for the species effects are offered, and some practical issues affecting the conduct of long-term, dietary toxicity studies are discussed.

To assess the situation in Spain, availability of pellets in sediments and rates of ingestion by waterfowl were determined in four important wetlands: Albufera de Valencia, El Fondo, Tablas de Daimiel, and Donana (Guadalquivir Marshes). Lead pellet density in sediment was maximum in the Albufera, with 2.8 million pellets/ha. In Tablas de Daimiel, where hunting was banned in 1965, about 1.0 million pellets/ha were found. Percentages of shot waterfowl with ingested pellets were maximum in the wetlands on the Mediterranean coast (El Fondo and Albufera de Valencia): 87.5% of common pochard (Aythya ferina) and approximately 33% of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and shoveler (Anas clypeata) contained ingested pellets. It was found that mallards with > 5 microg/g dry weight of lead in the liver had 8.5% lower body condition and 7.7% less body weight than birds with lower lead concentrations. Moreover, lead poisoning was diagnosed as the cause of death in 16 out of 75 birds, mainly greylag geese (Anser anser), found dead in some of these zones.
953	9652381	Oocysts of Cryptosporidium from snakes are not infectious to ducklings but retain viability after intestinal passage through a refractory host.	Graczyk TK, Cranfield MR, Fayer R	Vet Parasitol	 1998 May;77(1):33-40	 doi: 101016/s0304-4017(97)00137-4	Six 2-week-old Cryptosporidium-free Peking ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) each received 2.0 x 10(6) viable Cryptosporidium serpentis oocysts from 6 naturally infected captive snakes. Histological sections of digestive (stomach, jejunum, ileum, cloaca, and cecum) and respiratory tract tissues (larynx, trachea, and lungs) did not contain life-cycle stages of Cryptosporidium in any of the inoculated ducklings. Because ducklings were refractory to infection, C. serpentis transmission via a diet of Peking ducklings is improbable. Viable (per in vitro excystation assay) inoculum-derived oocysts were detected in duckling feces up to 7 days post-inoculation (PI); the number of intact oocysts excreted during the first 2 days PI was significantly higher than for the remaining 5 days PI (P < 0.01). The dynamics of oocyst shedding showed that overall the birds released a significantly higher number of intact oocysts than oocyst shells (P < 0.01). Retention of the viability of C. serpentis oocysts following intestinal passage through a refractory avian species may have epizootiological implications. Under certain circumstances such as after the ingestion of C. serpentis-infected prey, herpetivorous birds may disseminate C. serpentis oocysts in the environment.
954	9646407	Preliminary examinations on the effects of the breed characteristic feature "feather crest" on skull and brain anatomy of domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos f. dom.)	Bartels T, Brinkmeier J, Kummerfeld N, Krautwald-Junghanns ME, Baulain U, Klingmuller V	Tierarztl Prax Ausg G Grosstiere Nutztiere	 1998 May;26(3):168-73		As mentioned in older sources, the crested breed of the domestic duck is described as variety with high pre- and postnatal mortalities, malformations in skull and brain anatomy, and several central nervous deficiencies in affected birds. Therefore this breed is to be called defective and abnormal in the sense of section 11b of the German protection of animals legislation. Poultry fanciers reject these findings as incorrect, but accurate scientific examinations that bear out this allegation are not available. Preliminary examinations have demonstrated that brain and skull anatomy of living animals can be described by using non-invasive diagnostic techniques (magnet-resonance-imaging, computerized tomography, radiography). The use of this progressive methods enables to expressive findings on present stocks of domestic ducks. Many of the test animals investigated in preliminary examinations by using magnet-resonance-imaging and radiography showed abnormal tissue deposits in the tentorium cerebelli, meningo-encephalocele, cranial malformations, and variable bone formations in the thickened hypodermis of the crest. If crested ducks are mated against each other, numerous offspring show malformations of upper beak and cranium, encephalocele, as well as craniopagal parasites in form of rudimentary legs.
955	9645854	Vector ability of mosquitoes for isolates of Plasmodium elongatum from raptors in Florida.	Nayar JK, Knight JW, Telford SR Jr	J Parasitol	 1998 Jun;84(3):542-6		Three isolates of Plasmodium elongatum were obtained from 3 species of raptors (red-tailed hawk [Buteo jamaicensis], bald eagle [Haliaeetus leucocephalus], and eastern screech owl [Otus asio]) from Florida using isodiagnostic techniques in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Six to 10 species of mosquitoes were tested for susceptibility to these 3 isolates. Complete development of the sporogonic cycle of the 3 isolates of P. elongatum occurred in 3 species of mosquitoes, Culex nigripalpus, Culex restuans, and Culex salinarius. The pattern of susceptibility was similar among the 3 isolates of P. elongatum in Cx. nigripalpus. Culex restuans and Cx. salinarius were significantly more susceptible than Cx. nigripalpus to the 3 isolates of P. elongatum tested. Culex nigripalpus transmitted all 3 isolates of P. elongatum from duck to duck both by bite and after intraperitoneal injection of sporozoites. Infections of the 2 isolates tested occurred in ducks after intraperitoneal injection of sporozoites from Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius. The results suggest that these 3 Culex species are potential vectors of P. elongatum from raptors in Florida.

Torrella JR, Fouces V, Palomeque J, Viscor G	J Anat	 1998 Feb;192 ( Pt 2):211-22	 doi: 101046/j1469-7580199819220211x	Six muscles of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), the common coot (Fulica atra) and the yellow-legged gull (Larus cachinnans) were analysed morphometrically, with special emphasis on their functional implications and physiological needs. Oxidative fibres always had significantly smaller size than anaerobic fibres, although no differences in the number of capillaries per fibre were found. This resulted in greater capillary counts per unit of fibre area and perimeter in oxidative than anaerobic fibres, which indicates that the greater demand for oxygen supply may be achieved by decreasing the size of the muscle fibre rather than by increasing the number of associated capillaries. Fast oxidative fibres of the pectoralis and the triceps of the gull had greater sizes than the fast oxidative fibres of the mallard and the coot, which correlates with the difference in energetic demands between flapping and gliding flight. Greater fibre cross-sectional areas and perimeters seem suited to afford the long-lasting activity with low metabolic demands required during gliding. By contrast, mallards and coots attain a high oxidative metabolism, during sustained flapping flight, by reducing fibre size at the expense of a diminished ability for force generation. Between-species comparisons of the hindlimb muscles only yielded differences for the anaerobic fibres of the gastrocnemius, as an important adaptive response to force generation during burst locomotion. The need to manage sustained swimming abilities effectively may result in similar FOG fibre morphometry of the hindlimb muscles studied, indicating that a compromise between the oxygen flux to the muscle cell and the development of power is highly optimised in oxidative fibres of the bird species studied.

Feather samples were collected from adult and juvenile osprey (Pandion haliaetus), including juvenile osprey from three additional comparison sites; adult western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis); adult great blue herons (Ardea herodias); adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos); adult turkey vultures (Cathartes aura); and juvenile double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). Samples were analyzed by a multielemental x-ray fluorescence method. The osprey from Clear Lake showed significantly elevated mercury concentrations relative to the comparison sites. Different species at Clear Lake had different mercury concentrations based on trophic status; osprey exhibited the highest mercury concentrations and the mallards showed the lowest. Lastly, we quantified differences in elemental concentrations, including mercury, between adult and juvenile osprey from Clear Lake. Elements known to be nutrients, such as sulfur and zinc, did not vary significantly among species or sites. Reproductive success of osprey at Clear Lake was monitored from 1992 to 1996 to determine if osprey reproduction was depressed. During this five-year period, the breeding population grew from 10 to 20 nesting pairs and the average reproductive rate was 1.4 fledglings per nesting attempt. Although the osprey showed the highest mercury levels of any species sampled, their reproduction does not appear to be depressed.
958	9628539	Plasma testosterone profiles, semen characteristics, and artificial insemination in yearling and adult captive Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Stunden CE, Bluhm CK, Cheng KM, Rajamahendran R	Poult Sci	 1998 Jun;77(6):882-7	 doi: 101093/ps/776882	Testosterone profiles and semen characteristics were determined using yearling and adult captive wild-strain Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) drakes. Wild-strain Mallard hens were artificially inseminated by modifying a technique developed for domesticated poultry. In both adult and yearling drakes, there was a change in the concentration of circulating plasma testosterone during the reproductive season. Testosterone concentrations increased from basal levels in March, peaked in April, and decreased to basal levels in May. The decrease in testosterone concentration to basal level was 2 wk earlier in yearlings than in adults (P < 0.05). The decrease in testosterone concentration was associated with the onset of postnuptial molt. Semen volume (0.04 to 0.08 mL) and semen concentration (approximately 1.32 x 10(9) spermatozoa per milliliter) were not different between adult and yearling drakes (P > 0.05). Overall mean fertility for yearling and adult drakes obtained with artificial insemination was 70.4%. These results suggest that artificial insemination may be used successfully in the propagation of captive wild-strain Mallard ducks.
959	9601924	Aluminum and acid effects on calcium and phosphorus metabolism in young growing chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Capdevielle MC, Hart LE, Goff J, Scanes CG	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1998 Jul;35(1):82-8	 doi: 101007/s002449900353	Acidification is associated with increased mortality, reduced growth, and bone abnormalities in birds. Associated with acid deposition is an increase in aluminum availability due to solubilization from soil and other sources. (Conversely, experimental diets containing aluminum sulfate have much reduced pHs.) The present studies compare the effects of two levels of dietary acid (sulfuric acid) (0.122 and 0.56 mol H+ per kg feed; 0.056 and 0.277 mol sulfate per kg feed) and dietary aluminum (aluminum sulfate at 0.1 and 0.5%; sulfate at 0. 056 and 0.277 mol sulfate per kg feed) on bone growth, mineralization, and phosphorous/calcium homeostasis in growing birds (chickens and mallard ducks). Growth was reduced by the high acid (chicken) and aluminum (ducks and chickens) diets. A reduction in bone mineralization was observed in birds receiving aluminum-containing diets [low aluminum diet: decreased tibia ash, calcium, and phosphorus (chickens); high aluminum diet: decreased tibia dry weight, % of ash and mg; ash, calcium (chickens, ducks as % of ash), and phosphorus (chickens mg/duck, % of ash)]. Moreover, plasma concentrations of inorganic phosphate were reduced in chicks on the high aluminum diet. There were also marked decreases in bone growth and mineralization [tibia weight, ash (mg), calcium (mg), phosphorus (mg)] and plasma concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 in chicks on the high acid diet compared to those on a control diet. These changes were probably due to reduced feed intake; changes in bone indices being of a greater or similar magnitude in pairfed control. There was little change in bone indices, growth rate or feed consumption in ducklings receiving either the low or high acid diets. It is concluded that aluminum directly adversely affected bone mineralization whereas acid effects are mediated in part by changes in feed consumption.
960	9601151	Plasma lipid changes in the female mule duck (Cairina moschata x Anas platyrhynchos) experimentally infected with Eimeria mulardi.	Pascalon-Pekelniczky A	Vet Res	 1998 Mar-Apr;29(2):197-206		Plasma levels of phospholipids, triglycerides, high density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol and HDL-phospholipids were studied in 48 11-d-old female mule ducks infected per os with 5 x 10(3) x 10(4) x 5 x 10(5) sporulated oocysts of Eimeria mulardi (D0), or kept as an uninfected control group. Data were recorded from D-1 to D17. Mortality and weight loss were only observed with the 5 x 10(5) oocyst dose. Plasma phospholipids were significantly reduced with the two highest infecting doses on D3, and returned to normal values by D9 with the highest infecting dose. The minimum level attained was no lower than 74% of the control group. Triglyceride levels were reduced early but only slightly and irregularly in the three infected groups. HDL-cholesterol was significantly reduced from D5 and HDL-phospholipids from D3. These reduced levels depended on the infecting dose and were lowest on D5, respectively 34 and 35% of the control group with the highest infecting dose. In this group, the levels remained lower than in the uninfected group on D17. These perturbations in blood lipid classes have been described in avian coccidiosis.
961	9591362	Effects of ANG II and III and angiotensin receptor blockers on nasal salt gland secretion and arterial blood pressure in conscious Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Butler DG, Zandevakili R, Oudit GY	J Comp Physiol B	 1998 Apr;168(3):213-24	 doi: 101007/s003600050139	The vertebrate renin-angiotensin system controls cardiovascular, renal and osmoregulatory functions. Angiotensin II (ANG II) is the most potent hormone of the RAS but in some vertebrate animals angiotensin III (Val4-ANG III) may be a hormone. We studied the effects of some angiotensins and mammalian ANG II receptor antagonists on nasal salt gland function and arterial blood pressure in conscious white Pekin ducks. Nasal salt gland fluid secretion (NFS) was induced by a 10 ml.kg-1 bw i.v. injection of a NaCl solution (1000 mosmol.kg-1 H2O) and maintained by a continuous i.v. infusion of the same solution at a rate of 0.97 ml.min-1. There was a positive linear correlation between nasal fluid [Na+] and osmolality, between [Na+] and [K+], and also between the rate of NFS and [Na+] and [K+]. [Asp1, Val5]-ANG II (1 nmol.kg-1 i.v.) inhibited NFS but did not change ionic concentrations. Val4-ANG III (1 or 5 nmol.kg-1) and ANG I (1-7) (20 nmol.kg-1) had no effect on NFS. [Sar1, Ile8]-ANG II (SARILE) acted as an ANG II receptor agonist and resulted in a prolonged and complete inhibition of NFS. The AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (DuP 753) and the AT2 receptor antagonist, PD 123319 both failed to block the inhibitory effect of [Asp1, Val5]-ANG II on the nasal salt glands. [Asp1, Val5]-ANG II (2 nmol.kg-1 i.v.) increased mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), whereas the same dose of [Asn1, Val5]-ANG II (teleost) had only 30% of the pressor potency of the avian ANG II. Neither 1 nor 5 nmol.kg-1 of Val4-ANG III i.v. nor 20 nmol.kg-1 of ANG I (1-7) had any measurable effect on MABP. SARILE blocked completely the pressor response to [Asp1, Val5]-ANG II but the AT1 antagonists losartan and CGP 48933 and the AT2 antagonist PD 123319 all failed to block the pressor response to [Asp1, Val5]-ANG II. These results have substantiated an important role of the nasal salt gland in potassium regulation and highlighted a pharmacological dimorphism of saralasin, namely agonist and antagonist to angiotensin II-mediated inhibition of nasal salt gland function and pressor response, respectively. Using specific nonpeptidergic angiotensin II receptor antagonists, we have confirmed the distinct pharmacology of the avian angiotensin II receptors in a nongallinaceous species and the absence of significant angiotensin I (1-7) and angiotensin II effects on the cardiovascular system and nasal salt gland.

The bacteriological evidence of the infection was found in 17 (41%) of 41 domestic birds and 37 (22%) of 167 wild birds by the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, C. burnetii was isolated from five each of serum, spleen and fecal specimens from five jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) (whose sera were positive by both the MA test and PCR) by inoculating laboratory mice. Domestic quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) (3%), domestic muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) (3%), domestic chickens (2%), domestic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) (2%), carrion crows (Corvus corone) (37%), jungle crows (35%), and wild rock doves (Columba livia) (6%) showed serologic evidence of experience with C. burnetii. There was a tendency for a high prevalence among birds living and/or feeding in close proximity to infected livestock. This suggests that these birds are one of the less important links in maintaining the whole cycle of C. burnetii infection.
963	9541602	Secretory immune system of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Identification and expression of the genes encoding IgA and IgM heavy chains.	Magor KE, Warr GW, Bando Y, Middleton DL, Higgins DA	Eur J Immunol	 1998 Mar;28(3):1063-8	 doi: 101002/(SICI)1521-4141(199803)28:03<1063::AID-IMMU1063>30CO;2-O	IgA has not previously been identified in waterfowl. Studies instead revealed physical and antigenic similarities between duck bile immunoglobulin (Ig) and serum IgM. Here, a differential screening approach was used to clone, from a duck spleen library, the cDNA encoding the heavy (H) chains of IgM and the Ig, identified here as IgA, occurring in duck secretions. Phylogenetic comparisons of inferred amino acid sequences of entire H chain constant (C) regions and of individual domains revealed that the duck mu chain was closest to chicken mu (54% overall identity), and duck alpha was closest to chicken alpha (50% identity). Comparison of the mu and alpha C regions revealed areas of up to 65% amino acid similarity within the C4 domains, accounting for the previously noted antigenic overlap of duck IgM and IgA. Messages for alpha and mu were detected in duck lymphoid organs but the alpha message was most abundant in the respiratory, alimentary and reproductive tracts. The alpha message first appeared around 14 days of age and reached adult levels of expression only at 35-50 days. The results indicate that the duck has a mucosal immune system which utilizes IgA; however, the delayed expression and secretion of duck IgA explains the susceptibility of ducklings to mucosal pathogens. Since the waterfowl are among the most primitive extant birds, the recognition of IgA in the duck supports the conclusion that IgA occurs throughout the class Aves and also existed in the common ancestors of birds and mammals.
964	28307943	Habitat selection rules in breeding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos): a test of two competing hypotheses.	Poysa H, Elmberg J, Sjoberg K, Nummi P	Oecologia	 1998 Apr;114(2):283-287	 doi: 101007/s004420050447	Ideal preemption and conspecific attraction are alternative hypotheses of the habitat selection rules used by individuals. According to the former an occupied site is assumed to be preempted and therefore not available for later arriving individuals, whereas according to the latter individuals are assumed to be attracted by conspecifics to occupied sites, rather than avoiding them. We studied these competing hypotheses in breeding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) by a cross-over experiment in 2 years, introducing birds onto lakes before migratory wild mallards arrived. If mallards use the ideal preemptive rule, breeding density of wild mallards in experimental lakes should be lower and they should be occupied less frequently than control lakes, but if mallards use the conspecific attraction rule the reverse should be true. Our results allowed us to reject the ideal preemptive rule whereas the conspecific attraction rule was to some extent supported. We discuss these findings in relation to population limitation. The results suggest that the local breeding population studied is not limited by spacing behaviour related to habitat selection.
965	9440248	Effects of induced hypo- and hyperthyroidism on immune function and plasma biochemistry in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Fowles JR, Fairbrother A, Kerkvliet NI	Comp Biochem Physiol C Pharmacol Toxicol Endocrinol	 1997 Oct;118(2):213-20	 doi: 101016/s0742-8413(97)00107-2	Hypo- or hyperthyroid states were induced in adult male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) by subchronic exposure to daily injections of methimazole or a 9:1 ratio of thyroxine (T4): triiodothyronine (T3). The levels of T4 given were 0, 125, 250, or 500 micrograms/kg/day and for methimazole; 10 mg/kg/day for 22 or 21 days. Plasma T3 showed a lasting decrease with T4:T3 treatment, despite the attempt to maintain the normal T4:T3 ratio. Antibody formation to sheep red blood cells was decreased only at the 125 micrograms/kg/day dose of T4, and was unaffected by methimazole treatment. Natural killer cell activity to RP-9 tumor cells and macrophage phagocytosis of killed, opsonized Saccaromyces cereviseae were unaffected by treatment throughout the study. However, lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxic activity to RP-9 tumor cells was significantly decreased after 21 days of methimazole treatment, indicating that hypothyroidism may have an influence on cell-mediated immunity. Hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions had opposing effects on plasma cholesterol levels.
966	9391953	Perspectives on the diagnosis, epizootiology, and control of the 1973 duck plague epizootic in wild waterfowl at Lake Andes, South Dakota.	Pearson GL, Cassidy DR	J Wildl Dis	 1997 Oct;33(4):681-705	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-334681	An epizootic of duck plague occurred in early 1973 in a population of 163,500 wild waterfowl, primarily mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), wintering on Lake Andes and the nearby Missouri River in southeastern South Dakota (USA). The diagnosis was based on pathologic lesions and confirmed by virus isolation. Control measures included quarantine, attempts to reduce virus contamination of the area, dispersal of waterfowl, and monitoring of wild waterfowl populations for mortality. The epizootic resulted in documented mortality of 18% and estimated mortality of 26% of the waterfowl at risk. Prompt implementation of control measures might have limited mortality to approximately 8%. Losses during the epizootic were equivalent to 0.12% of the annual mortality in the North American 1996 fall population of 80,000,000 wild ducks. The most likely sources of the infection were free-flying wild mallard or American black duck (Anas rubripes) carriers from the upper midwestern or northeastern United States. Duck plague serum neutralization antibodies were demonstrated in 31% of 395 apparently healthy mallards sampled prior to dispersal of the flock at Lake Andes, suggesting that tens of thousands of potential duck plague carriers entered the wild waterfowl populations of all four major flyways. Consequently, the absence of major epizootics of duck plague in wild waterfowl in the subsequent two decades is evidence that substantial numbers of duck plague carriers can occur in wild waterfowl populations without resulting in epizootic mortalities. The failure to isolate duck plague virus from apparently healthy mallards sampled during the epizootic raises questions concerning the validity of conclusions regarding the status of duck plague in wild waterfowl based upon negative results of random surveys conducted in the absence of epizootics.
967	9388021	Organization and efferent connections of the archistriatum of the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos L.: an anterograde and retrograde tracing study.	Dubbeldam JL, den Boer-Visser AM, Bout RG	J Comp Neurol	 1997 Dec 1;388(4):632-57	 doi: 101002/(sici)1096-9861(19971201)388:4<632::aid-cne10>30co;2-n	The intratelencephalic and descending connections of the archistriatum of the mallard were studied using anterograde and retrograde tracers. Autoradiography after injections of [3H]-leucine served to visualize the intratelencephalic and extratelencephalic efferent connections of the archistriatum. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), HRP-wheatgerm agglutinin, and fluorescent tracers were used to identify the precise origin of the projections to the various terminal fields found in the anterograde experiments. Four main regions can be recognized in the archistriatum of the mallard: (1) the rostral or anterior part that is a source of contralateral intratelencephalic projections, in particular to the contralateral archistriatum; (2) the dorsal intermediate archistriatum that is the origin of a large descending fiber system, the occipitomesencephalic tract, with projections to dorsal thalamic nuclei, the medial spiriform nucleus, the intercollicular nucleus, the deep tectum, parts of the mesencephalic and bulbar reticular formation, and the subnuclei of the descending trigeminal tract. There are no direct projections to motor nuclei. This part corresponds to the somatic sensorimotor part as defined by Zeier and Karten (1971, Brain Res. 31:313-326); it also contributes to the ipsilateral intratelencephalic connections and, to a lesser degree, to contralateral intratelencephalic connections. (3) The ventral intermediate archistriatum is another region that is also a source of intratelencephalic projections, in particular of those to the lobus parolfactorius. The most lateral zone sends fibers to the septal area. (4) The caudoventral intermediate and posterior archistriatum is another region that is a source of the projections to the hypothalamus and thus corresponds to the amygdaloid part of the archistriatum as defined by Zeier and Karten; it also contributes a modest component to the occipitomesencephalic tract. The different cell populations are not spatially separated, which makes it impossible to recognize distinct subnuclei within the four main regions of the archistriatum of the mallard.
968	9379302	Plasmodium forresteri n. sp., from raptors in Florida and southern Georgia: its distinction from Plasmodium elongatum morphologically within and among host species and by vector susceptibility.	Telford SR Jr, Nayar JK, Foster GW, Knight JW	J Parasitol	 1997 Oct;83(5):932-7		Plasmodium forresteri n. sp. naturally infects eastern screech-owls (Otus asio), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), barred owls (Strix varia), bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), broad-winged hawks (Buteo platypterus), and red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) in Florida and southern Georgia. Schizonts occur in mature or nearly mature erythrocytes, produce 2-6 merozoites arranged most commonly in fan or cruciform configuration, with mean dimensions among host species varying from 3.7 to 4.8 x 2.5 to 3.4 microns. Gametocytes are elongate, with mean dimensions among host species varying from 11.5 to 13.1 x 2.0 to 2.4 microns. One or both gametocyte margins are irregular and often crenulate. Gametocytes seldom fill the space between the erythrocyte nucleus and margin. Species characteristics were maintained in isodiagnostic Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). In mosquito infection studies, only Culex restuans could support sporogony of P. forresteri, in contrast to Plasmodium elongatum of raptor origin that completed sporogony in both Cx. restuans and Culex nigripalpus.
969	9268144	Central connections of the nucleus mesencephalicus nervi trigemini in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Bout RG, Tellegen AJ, Dubbeldam JL	Anat Rec	 1997 Aug;248(4):554-65	 doi: 101002/(SICI)1097-0185(199708)248:4<554::AID-AR7>30CO;2-L	BACKGROUND: In the mallard duck, functionally distinct groups of jaw muscles are each innervated by a different subnucleus of the main trigeminal (mV) or facial (mVII) motor nucleus. The other subnuclei of mV and mVII innervate several head muscles, including lingual muscles. The reticular premotor cells of the trigeminal and facial jaw motor subnuclei occupy different areas in the parvocellular reticular formation (RPc). The cell bodies of jaw muscle spindle afferents are situated in the mesencephalic nucleus (MesV). In the present study, the central connections of MesV with jaw motor subnuclei and their premotor areas are investigated. METHODS: In a first series of experiments, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injections were made in electrophysiologically identified trigeminal and facial subnuclei. In a second series of experiments, HRP was delivered iontophoretically at different parts of RPc. Anterograde tracing with tritiated leucine was used to confirm the central connections of MesV. Double labeling with fluorescent tracers was used to investigate whether MesV collaterals reach both the rostral and caudal parts of RPc. RESULTS: MesV projects to only two of the five different subnuclei of the trigeminal motor nucleus. The subnuclei that receive spindle afferents innervate jaw adductor muscles (mV2) or pro- and retractors of the mandible (pterygoid muscles; mV1). The three other subnuclei innervate jaw-opener muscles or other head muscles. MesV fibers also project to the rostral part of the dorsolateral RPc (RPcdl), which serves as a premotor area for the motor subnuclei of adductor and pterygoid muscles. The intermediate part of RPcdl does not contain premotor cells of mV or mVII, and a clear projection of MesV to this area is absent. The caudal part of RPcdl projects to the mV and mVII subnuclei that innervate jaw-opener muscles. This part of RPc receives a projection from the same MesV cells as the rostral RPcdl. The MesV projection to RPc does not include premotor cells of mV and mVII in the ventromedial part of RPc (RPcvm). CONCLUSIONS: Spindle afferents from jaw-closer muscles project only to mV subnuclei innervating jaw-closer muscles (mV1, mV2) and to a population of premotor cells in the rostral RPcdl that innervates these subnuclei. The mixed population of premotor cells in RPcvm, which innervates both jaw-opener and jaw-closer subnuclei, does not receive a MesV projection. However, a premotor area for jaw-opener subnuclei in the caudal part of RPcdl does receive MesV input and may serve as a relay through which proprioceptive information from jaw closer spindles can reach jaw opener muscles.
970	9223507	Coinfection of wild ducks by influenza A viruses: distribution patterns and biological significance.	Sharp GB, Kawaoka Y, Jones DJ, Bean WJ, Pryor SP, Hinshaw V, Webster RG	J Virol	 1997 Aug;71(8):6128-35	 doi: 101128/JVI7186128-61351997	Coinfection of wild birds by influenza A viruses is thought to be an important mechanism for the diversification of viral phenotypes by generation of reassortants. However, it is not known whether coinfection is a random event or follows discernible patterns with biological significance. In the present study, conducted with viruses collected throughout 15 years from a wild-duck population in Alberta, Canada, we identified three discrete distributions of coinfections. In about one-third of the events, which involved subtypes of viruses that appear to be maintained in this duck reservoir, coinfection occurred at rates either close to or significantly lower than one would predict from rates of single-virus infection. Apparently, the better adapted an influenza A virus is to an avian population, the greater is its ability to prevent coinfections. Conversely, poorly adapted, nonmaintained viruses were significantly overrepresented as coinfectants. Rarely encountered subtypes appear to represent viruses whose chances of successfully infiltrating avian reservoirs are increased by coinfection. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and pintails (A. acuta) were significantly more likely to be infected by a single influenza A virus than were the other species sampled, but no species was significantly more likely to be coinfected. These observations provide the first evidence of nonrandom coinfection of wild birds by influenza A viruses, suggesting that reassortment of these viruses in a natural population does not occur randomly. These results suggest that even though infections may occur in a species, all subtypes are not maintained by all avian species. They also suggest that specific influenza A virus subtypes are differentially adapted to different avian hosts and that the fact that a particular subtype is isolated from a particular avian species does not mean that the virus is maintained by that species.
971	9249683	Diagnostic criteria for selenium toxicosis in aquatic birds: histologic lesions.	Green DE, Albers PH	J Wildl Dis	 1997 Jul;33(3):385-404	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-333385	Chronic selenium toxicosis was induced in 1-yr-old male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) by feeding selenium, as seleno-DL-methionine, in amounts of 0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 parts per million (ppm) to five groups of 21 ducks each for 16 wk during March to July 1988. All mallards in the 80 ppm group, three in the 40 ppm group, and one in the 20 ppm group died. Histologic lesions in mallards that died of selenosis were hepatocellular vacuolar degeneration progressing to centrolobular and panlobular necrosis, nephrosis, apoptosis of pancreatic exocrine cells, hypermaturity and avascularity of contour feathers of the head with atrophy of feather follicles, lymphocytic necrosis and atrophy of lymphoid organs (spleen, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and lumbar lymph nodes), and severe atrophy and degeneration of fat. Histologic lesions in surviving mallards in the 40 ppm group, which had tissue residues of selenium comparable to mallards that died, were fewer and much milder than mallards that died; lesions consisted of atrophy of lymphoid tissue, hyalinogranular swelling of hepatocytes, atrophy of seminiferous tubules, and senescence of feathers. No significant histologic lesions were detected in euthanized mallards in the 0, 10 and 20 ppm groups. Based on tissue residues and histologic findings, primarily in the liver, there was a threshold of selenium accumulation above which pathophysiologic changes were rapid and fatal. Pathognomonic histologic lesions of fatal and nonfatal selenosis were not detected. Criteria for diagnosis of fatal selenosis in aquatic birds include consistent histologic lesions in the liver, kidneys, and organs of the immune system. Although histologic changes were present in cases of chronic non-fatal selenosis, these were inconsistent. Consistent features of fatal and non-fatal chronic selenosis were marked weight loss and elevated concentrations of selenium in organs.
972	28307498	Interspecific interactions and co-existence in dabbling ducks: observations and an experiment.	Elmberg J, Poysa H, Sjoberg K, Nummi P	Oecologia	 1997 Jun;111(1):129-136	 doi: 101007/s004420050216	We studied the possible role of resource limitation and interspecific competition in assemblages of dabbling ducks on breeding lakes in Finland and Sweden with observational and experimental data. After initial vegetation mapping and yearly censuses of ducks in 1985-1990, we collected observational data in 1991-1994 from 28 lakes with natural populations of mallard Anas platyrhynchos and teal A. crecca. Mallard and teal co-occur over vast areas in the Holarctic and they are the only breeding dabbling ducks on many oligotrophic lakes. Both species are migratory in our study regions, teal arriving later in spring than mallards. Log-linear model analysis of observational presence/absence data revealed a positive, not a negative, association between the species. This association was independent of habitat diversity as well as of lake size. Mallard-teal interaction was also studied in a cross-over introduction experiment in 32 other lakes in two years. Wing-clipped mallards were introduced to breeding lakes before the arrival of teal to induce resource limitation and interspecific competition, hypothesized to reduce lake use by teal. The density of mallard pairs on experimental lakes was 2.9-8.0 times higher than on controls, but there was no negative response by teal to the treatment. This is the first combined observational-experimental demonstration of lack of interspecific competition in waterfowl. Our results indicate that heterospecific attraction may affect species co-existence in dabbling ducks.

Nicol K, Watson H, Stevens L	Br Poult Sci	 1997 May;38(2):217-9	 doi: 101080/00071669708417972	1. Ovomucoids were purified from Muscovy duck, domestic duck and domestic goose. 2. Peptide maps of cyanogen bromide-cleaved ovomucoids from Muscovy duck and domestic duck were very similar to one another, but differed from that of goose. 3. Muscovy duck ovomucoid showed the same protease inhibitory pattern as ovomucoid from domestic duck, inhibiting trypsin in the molar ratio of 1:2 and chymotrypsin 1:1. 4. Inhibitory complexes could be detected between chymotrypsin and ovomucoid from both Muscovy and domestic duck, but not from goose, by using non-denaturing gels. 5. No complexes could be detected between DFP-inactivated chymotrypsin and any of the ovomucoids. 6. The results show that of ovomucoid from Muscovy duck more closely resembles that from domestic duck than goose.

Samuel MD, Goldberg DR, Shadduck DJ, Price JI, Cooch EG	J Wildl Dis	 1997 Apr;33(2):332-5	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-332332	Pharyngeal swabs were collected from 298 lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) at Banks Island (Northwest Territories. Canada) in the summer of 1994. Pasteurella multocida serotype 1 was isolated from an adult male bird and P. multocida serotype 3 was isolated from an adult female goose. Pathogenicity of the serotype 1 isolate was confirmed by inoculation in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The serotype 3 isolate was non-pathogenic in Pekin ducks. This is the first documented isolation of pathogenic P. multocida serotype 1 from apparently healthy wild snow geese.

Sparling DW, Gustafson M, Klein P, Karouna-Renier N	J Wildl Dis	 1997 Apr;33(2):187-97	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-332187	As part of an effort to understand extensive, white phosphorus (P4)-induced waterfowl mortality at Eagle River Flats, Fort Richardson, Alaska (USA), we conducted a number of acute toxicity tests using penned mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in 1993 and 1994. The 24-hr median lethal dose (LD50) for P4 dissolved in oil was 6.46 mg/kg in adult males and 6.96 mg/kg in adult females. Although the median lethal doses were not statistically different, the female dose-response curve had a statistically shallower slope than that of males. The LD50 for the ecologically more relevant pelletized form of P4 in adult males was 4.05 mg/kg. In mallards, one mechanism of P4 toxicity caused rapid (3 to 10 hr) mortality and had signs consistent with anoxia. A second, slower acting mechanism resulted in hepatic and renal pathology including extensive fat deposition in the liver and cellular necrosis. White phosphorus accumulated in adipose tissues, but only for a few days.
976	9088617	Acceleration of post-mortem changes in Tsaiya duck (Anas platyrhynchos) breast muscle by lactic acid marination.	Chou RG, Tseng TF, Chen MT	Br Poult Sci	 1997 Mar;38(1):78-83	 doi: 101080/00071669708417944	1. The effect of lactic acid marination at 5 degrees C on post mortem changes in breast muscle pectoralis major of spent layer Tsaiya duck was studied. 2. Myofibrils were prepared from 0.1 M and 0.2 M lactic acid marinated muscle and control (non-marinated samples) sampled at 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 d post mortem. 3. Changes in myofibril fragmentation index (MFI), myofibrillar proteins and Z-line structure were examined. 4. Marination of duck breast muscle in lactic acid at 5 degrees C enhanced fragmentation of myofibrils and degradation of myofibrillar proteins and Z-line structure as compared to control samples. 5. In summary, lactic acid marination at 5 degrees C can accelerate the post mortem degradation of myofibrils in Tsaiya duck breast muscle.
977	15093475	Clarification of effects of DDE on shell thickness, size, mass, and shape of avian eggs.	Blus LJ, Wiemeyer SN, Bunck CM	Environ Pollut	 1997;95(1):67-74	 doi: 101016/s0269-7491(96)00094-2	Moriarty et al. (1986) used field data to conclude that DDE decreased the size or altered the shape of avian eggs; therefore, they postulated that decreased eggshell thickness was a secondary effect because, as a general rule, thickness and egg size are positively correlated. To further test this relationship, the present authors analyzed data from eggs of captive American kestrels. Falco sparverius given DDT- or DDE-contaminated or clean diets and from wild brown pelicans Pelecanus occidentalis collected both before (pre-1946) and after (post-1945) DDT was introduced into the environment. Pertinent data from other field and laboratory studies were also summarized. DDE was not related to and did not affect size, mass, or shape of eggs of the brown pelican or American kestrel; but the relationship of DDE to eggshell thinning held true. Size and shape of eggs of brown pelicans from the post-1945 era and those of kestrels, on DDT-contaminated diets showed some significant, but inconsistent, changes compared to brown pelican data from the pre-1946 era or kestrels on clean diets. In contrast, nearly all samples of eggs of experimental kestrels given DDT-contaminated diets and those of wild brown pelicans from the post-1945 era exhibited significant eggshell thinning. Pertinent experimental studies with other sensitive avian species indicated no effects of DDE on the size or shape of eggs, even though the high dietary concentrations caused extreme eggshell thinning and mortality of some adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in one study. These findings essentially controvert the argument that decreased eggshell thickness is a secondary effect resulting from the primary effect of DDE-induced changes in the size or shape of eggs.

Graczyk TK, Cranfield MR, Klein PN	Mycopathologia	 1997-1998;140(3):121-7	 doi: 101023/a:1006805816537	The applicability of ELISA detection of circulating Aspergillus spp. antigen (Ag) and systemic antibody (Ab) of IgG class, and the blood parameter values were evaluated for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in Aspergillus spp.-challenged Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The protective role of Aspergillus spp. IgG was evaluated in Cape shelducks (Tadorna cana) immunized with Aspergillus spp. Ag. Challenged but non-immunized A. platyrhynchos developed invasive aspergillosis on day 21 as demonstrated histopathologically by the presence of fungal micro-granuloma in air sacs and lung tissue, with serum antigenemia fluctuating from 65 to 270 ng of 55-kD basic protein Ag per ml. Immunized A. platyrhynchos did not demonstrate Aspergillus spp. serum antigenemia but did show rare histopathological changes in some air sacs associated with fungal inflammation. Although the differences between immunized and non-immunized T. cana in blood evaluation parameters did not differ significantly, immunized birds mounted high Aspergillus spp.-specific IgG titer. There was no correlation between the blood parameter values and post-immunization timepoints in T. cana and in A. Platyrhynchos. Intramuscular immunization with Aspergillus spp. mycelial phase cultures Ag provided protection against the pathogens. The lack of relations between blood parameter values and increasing Aspergillus spp. IgG titers (in T. cana and A. platyrhynchos) indicate low applicability of these parameters in evaluation of a bird Aspergillus spp. status. Detection of circulating 55-kDa Aspergillus spp. Ag has high early predictive values for invasive aspergillosis in birds.

The helminths were found in 108 birds (25.17%) of 19 species. In infected birds there were found 4 species of trematodes: one of them, Catatropis verrucosa is in Poland new for Cygnus olor; 9 species of cestodes--7 of them are in Poland new for examined hosts; namely: Drepanidotaenia lanceolata for Dendrocygna viduata, Cygnus atratus, Branta bernicla, and Anas platyrhynchos; Microsomacanthus paracompressus for Cygnus olor; Dicranotaenia coronula for Chloephaga picta and Cairina moschata; Cloacotaenia megalops for Branta bernicla, Tschertkovilepis setigera for Cygnus olor, Anser indicus, Branta bernicla and Anas platyrhynchos; Fimbriaria fasciolaris for Cygnus olor and Chloephaga picta; Sobolevicanthus gracilis for Cygnus atratus, Chloephaga picta and Tadorna tadorna; 13 species of nematodes--7 of them are in Poland new for examined hosts, namely: Cyathostoma variegatum for Cygnus atratus, Anser indicus and Anser caerulescens; Syngamus trachea for Anser indicus; Echinuria uncinata for Anser indicus; Ganguleterakis dispar for Cgynus melanocoryphus, Cgynus olor and Anser caerulescens; Pterothominx caudinflata for Anser indicus; Amidostomum ansersis for Cygnus olor and Branta bernicla; Capillaria anatis for Anas acuta. No acanthocephalans were observed.
980	9319805	Changes in Na+/K+-ATPase expression during adaptive cell differentiation in avian nasal salt gland	Hildebrandt JP	J Exp Biol	 1997;200(Pt 13):1895-904	 doi: 101242/jeb200131895	Chronic salt stress in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) resulted in a sustained accumulation of cyclic AMP in the secretory cells of the nasal salt glands. Adaptive increases in the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase, measured as ATP hydrolysis rates in freshly isolated tissue, were observed after 12 h of salt stress. This change in enzyme activity was associated with increases in protein abundance in the - as well as in the ss-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase and an increase in ss-subunit glycosylation. We investigated whether the increase in the cytosolic cyclic AMP concentration and the adaptive changes in Na+/K+-ATPase activity were causally related. Using an organotypic tissue culture system for salt gland slices from unstressed (naive) ducklings, we produced similar changes in Na+/K+-ATPase activity and subunit abundance by treating cultured tissue with drugs that elevate cytosolic cyclic AMP levels (forskolin, 8-CPT-cAMP) during a 15 h culture period. Protein synthesis assays using cultured tissue revealed that elevations in cytosolic cyclic AMP level mediate increases in Na+/K+-ATPase subunit abundance by slowing down the degradation of ATPase subunits. This increase in the amount of enzyme protein was associated with a significant increase in Na+/K+-ATPase activity in tissue homogenates. The time course of these changes in cyclic-AMP-treated cultured tissue resembled that observed in salt-stressed intact animals, indicating that the elevation in cyclic AMP level in salt gland tissue may constitute a portion of the signalling events ultimately leading to the adaptive increase in Na+/K+-ATPase activity in vivo.
981	9037682	Effect of lead ingestion on concentrations of lead in tissues and eggs of laying Tsaiya ducks in Taiwan.	Jeng SL, Lee SJ, Liu YF, Yang SC, Liou PP	Poult Sci	 1997 Jan;76(1):13-6	 doi: 101093/ps/76113	This experiment was conducted to investigate Pb concentrations in soft tissues and eggs from laying Tsaiya ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica), dosed via gelatin capsule with 10 or 20 mg Pb/kg BW daily for 3 mo. Body weights of ducks were not influenced by Pb treatment. In addition, no clinical syndromes involving Pb intoxication were found throughout the experiment. The two levels of Pb consistently resulted in increases in the Pb content of blood, kidney, liver, and gizzard, whereas only 20 mg Pb/kg BW per d of dose additionally increased the Pb in femoral muscle. More Pb was deposited in the kidney and liver after Pb exposure than in the gizzard or femoral muscle. Lead residues in yolk and eggshell from Pb-dosed ducks were significantly higher than in controls; however, Pb in albumen was generally low and was not influenced by Pb treatment.
982	9027691	Use of body measurements and serum metabolites to estimate the nutritional status of mallards wintering in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, USA.	Dabbert CB, Martin TE, Powell KC	J Wildl Dis	 1997 Jan;33(1):57-63	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-33157	We collected mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from bottomland hardwood habitats on the Bayou Meto Wildlife Management Area and the White River National Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas County, Arkansas during the winter of 1990 to 1991 to determine if measures of physiological condition could be predicted from structural size, serum metabolite levels, or from direct measures of carcass composition. Serum triglyceride levels were correlated (r = 0.57, P = 0.007) with total body fat in males and slightly increased the value (from R2 = 0.64 to 0.76) of intact body mass alone for predicting total body fat in males. Overall, however, serum metabolites appeared to be poor indicators of the magnitude of nutrient masses in mallards. Three potential indices of nutritional status were developed from carcass composition data: protein/total ash, fat/ total ash, and fat/fat-free body mass. Protein masses of male mallards changed over winter (P = 0.02). Consequently, fat-free masses are not constant and represent poor indicators of structural size for mallards wintering in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.

984	8918237	Structure and expression of metallothionein gene in ducks.	Lee YJ, Chen YP, Wang SH, Chow WY, Lin LY	Gene	 1996 Oct 17;176(1-2):85-92	 doi: 101016/0378-1119(96)00224-7	Metallothionein (MT) cDNAs were cloned and sequenced from two genera of ducks, Muscovy (Cairina muschata) and Tsai ya (Anas platyrhynchos). The two cDNAs show an extremely high sequence homology and contain an open reading frame encoding 63 amino acids. MT mRNA expressions were studied after metal induction using the cloned cDNA as a probe. Cadmium and copper induced MT gene efficiently, whereas zinc showed a markedly less effect. In addition, the MT mRNA accumulations in various developmental stages were also investigated. The result reveals a different pattern of expression from that of mammals. The discrepancy in MT gene between Tsai ya and Muscovy was further explored by examining genomic DNA structures. The duck MT showed three exons and two introns. The most significant variation of the genes occurs at intron II in which Tsai ya MT has 24 bases more than Muscovy MT. Moreover, MT expressions in the hybrids of Muscovy and Tsai ya were investigated using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Those results demonstrated that parental MT genes are expressed in the hybrids after metal induction.
985	8939001	Sequences and comparisons of duck mitochondrial DNA control regions.	Liu HT, Hu YH, Wang CT, Lin LY	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	 1996 Oct;115(2):209-14	 doi: 101016/0305-0491(96)00118-6	In this study, the nucleotide sequences of the displacement loop (D-loop) and the ribosomal RNA genes of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were determined from a representative each of two genera of ducks, Cainina muschata and Anas platyrhynchos. The duck mtDNA shows a specific gene order at 5' upstream of D-loop (5'ND6-tRNA(Glu)-D-loop3') that is identical to chick mtDNA but is different from that of mammalian or amphibian (5' cytochrome b-tRNA(Thr)-tRNA(Pro)-D-loop3'). Nucleotide diversity is greatest in the D-loop while being most conserved in the 12S rRNA gene, as indicated from a sequence comparison between duck and chick mtDNA. A consensus sequence in the D-loop region, which may play influential roles in the regulation of transcription and replication of mtDNA, was found in both CSB-1 and repeated sequences of birds. Sequences of four tRNA genes in this region are also reported. Among them, tRNA(Glu) shows the greatest sequence divergence when different order of birds are compared.
986	8795213	Viability and infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts are retained upon intestinal passage through a refractory avian host.	Graczyk TK, Cranfield MR, Fayer R, Anderson MS	Appl Environ Microbiol	 1996 Sep;62(9):3234-7	 doi: 101128/aem6293234-32371996	Six Cryptosporidium-free Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were each orally inoculated with 2.0 x 10(6) Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts infectious to neonatal BALB/c mice. Histological examination of the stomachs jejunums, ilea, ceca, cloacae, larynges, tracheae, and lungs of the ducks euthanized on day 7 postinoculation (p.i.) revealed no life-cycle stages of C. parvum. However, inoculum-derived oocysts extracted from duck feces established severe infection in eight neonatal BALB/c mice (inoculum dose, 2.5 x 10(5) per mouse). On the basis of acid-fast stained direct wet smears, 73% of the oocysts in duck feces were intact (27% were oocyst shells), and their morphological features conformed to those of viable and infectious oocysts of the original inoculum. The fluorescence scores of the inoculated oocysts, obtained by use of the MERIFLUOR test, were identical to those obtained for the feces-recovered oocysts (the majority were 3+ to 4+). The dynamics of oocyst shedding showed that the birds released a significantly higher number of intact oocysts than the oocyst shells (P < 0.01). The number of intact oocysts shed (87%) during the first 2 days p.i. was significantly higher than the number shed during the remaining 5 days p.i. (P < 0.01) and significantly decreased from day 1 to day 2 p.i. (P < 0.01). The number of oocyst shells shed during 7 days p.i. did not vary significantly (P > 0.05). The retention of infectivity of C. parvum oocysts after intestinal passage through an aquatic bird has serious epidemiological and epizootiological implications. Waterfowl may serve as mechanical vectors for the waterborne oocysts and may enhance contamination of surface waters with C. parvum. As the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in source waters is attributable to watershed management practices, the watershed protection program should consider waterfowl as a potential factor enhancing contamination of the source water with C. parvum.
987	8781073	Residues of organochlorines in mallards and blue-winged teal collected in Colombia and Wisconsin, 1984-1989.	Botero JE, Meyer MW, Hurley SS, Rusch DH	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1996 Aug;31(2):225-31	 doi: 101007/BF00212370	We compared the seasonal concentrations of 12 organochlorine (OC) compounds in samples of breast muscle, associated skin, and subcutaneous fat of blue-winged teal (Anas discors) collected in Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia (1987-1988), and of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and blue-winged teal collected in Wisconsin (1984-1989). Although these species have similar feeding habits and overlapping breeding distributions, their winter ranges differ markedly. Most blue-winged teal winter in the Neotropics, whereas most mallards remain in the temperate regions of North America. A seasonal comparison of OC exposure in these species may help determine the geographic origins of contamination. All examined OCs were found to be below concentrations known to affect reproduction in waterfowl. DDE was most often detected in blue-winged teal and PCBs, in mallards. DDE exposure may have predominantly occurred outside of Wisconsin. The DDE concentration in blue-winged teal samples collected in Wisconsin in the spring (GM=0.406 microg/g) were greater (P<0.001) than in the fall (GM=0. 033 microg/g) and greater than the concentrations in mallard samples from the spring (GM=0.058 microg/g; P<0.001). Cienaga Grande, however, was not a source of DDE contamination. The DDE concentrations in blue-winged teal samples from Cienaga Grande did not differ between the spring (GM=0.037 microg/g) and the fall (GM=0. 039 microg/g) and were lower (P<0.001) than the concentration in blue-winged teal samples from Wisconsin in the spring. In contrast, PCB contamination seemed to have occurred in Wisconsin and affected mostly mallards. PCBs were not detected in the samples from Colombia and were detected in only five (8.3%) of the blue-winged teal samples from Wisconsin (GM=0.025 microg/g), however, those compounds were detected in 47% of the mallard samples collected in Wisconsin (GM=0.272 microg/g). DDE and PCB concentrations were greater (P=0.0) in mallard samples collected from wetlands adjacent to Lake Michigan than in samples from inland wetlands.
988	8842464	Crossbreeding effects on reproductive traits in two strains of duck (Anas platyrhynchos): brown Tsaiya and Pekin.	Velez A, Brun JM, Rouvier R	Br Poult Sci	 1996 Jul;37(3):571-7	 doi: 101080/00071669608417887	1. The reproductive performances of 211 domestic duck females (Anas platyrhynchos) from the pure breeds Brown Tsaiya (Ts) and Pekin (Pk) and their two reciprocal crossbreds were analysed. 2. Differences in the 4 genotypes, additive direct and maternal crossbreeding effects and heterosis were estimated on the following traits: age at first egg, egg production to the ages of 30, 35, 40 and 52 weeks of age, egg weight at 30 weeks of age, and (egg) fertility by artificial insemination with Muscovy drakes' pooled semen. 3. Egg production up to 52 weeks of age was higher in Ts than in Pk (respectively 214 +/- 7 and 150 +/- 8 eggs), but not statistically different from that of the reciprocal crossbreds. The ratio of settable eggs to total eggs was nearly 90%, without any difference between genotypes. 4. Average egg weight at the age of 30 weeks was 75 +/- 0.9 g for Pk, which was higher than the corresponding values for Ts (62 +/- 0.8 g), but not significantly different from the crossbreds. 5. An effect of genotype was found on egg fertility: the Pk strain exhibited the lowest value, 71.3 +/- 3.1% compared with 75.9 +/- 2.1% for Ts, 80.6 +/- 2.6% for Ts x Pk and 74.6 +/- 1.9% for Pk x Ts. 6. Crossbreeding genetic variables showed favourable direct genetic effects for egg production and (egg) fertility in Ts, while Pk had favourable direct genetic effects on egg weight. The Pk genotype had a favourable maternal effect on fertility. Direct heterosis was 34% and 10% for egg production up to 30 and 52 weeks of age respectively, 8.8% for egg weight and 5.4% for (egg) fertility. 7. Crossing Ts with Pk seems profitable for the production of mule ducklings.
989	8827673	Diagnostic criteria for selenium toxicosis in aquatic birds: dietary exposure, tissue concentrations, and macroscopic effects.	Albers PH, Green DE, Sanderson CJ	J Wildl Dis	 1996 Jul;32(3):468-85	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-323468	A feeding study with mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) was conducted during March to July 1988 in Laurel, Maryland (USA), to identify diagnostic criteria for selenium toxicosis in birds. One-year-old male mallards in groups of 21 were fed diets containing 0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 parts per million (ppm) selenium, as seleno-DL-methionine, for 16 weeks. All ducks receiving 80 ppm died. Ducks receiving 40 or 80 ppm selenium consumed less feed than ducks in the other treatment groups. Body weights of ducks receiving 40 or 80 ppm selenium declined during the study. The post-breeding molt was delayed in ducks receiving 40 ppm; most ducks receiving 80 ppm selenium died prior to the onset of molt. At necropsy, numerous abnormalities were observed in ducks that died but only a small number of abnormalities were observed in ducks surviving to the end of the study in the 40 ppm group. Weights of the heart, spleen, and pancreas were mostly lower and weights of the kidney were higher for ducks dying during the study than for euthanized ducks. Liver weights were unaffected. Selenium accumulated in soft tissues approximately in proportion to dietary concentrations. Selenium concentrations in tissues of all ducks that died were different from those of surviving ducks in the 0, 10, and 20 ppm groups, but were not different from those of surviving ducks in the 40 ppm group. Proposed diagnostic criteria for fatal chronic selenosis were derived from body weight, macroscopic abnormalities, organ weights, and concentrations of selenium in the liver. Proposed diagnostic criteria for non-fatal chronic selenosis were derived from body weight, plumage condition, macroscopic abnormalities, concentrations of selenium in the liver, reproductive failure, and alterations of blood and tissue chemistries. Lead or dioxin poisoning have diagnostic criteria most similar to selenium toxicosis.
990	8827671	Virulence of six strains of duck plague virus in eight waterfowl species.	Spieker JO, Yuill TM, Burgess EC	J Wildl Dis	 1996 Jul;32(3):453-60	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-323453	Susceptibility of New World waterfowl to the Lake Andes strain of duck plague virus (DPV) was assessed by intramuscular inoculation of adult muscovies (Cairina moschata), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), redheads (Aythya americana), gadwalls (Anas strepera), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and pintails (Anas acuta). The relative virulence of DPV strains isolated from five United States and one Canadian location was established in muscovies, mallards, and Canada geese. Differences in DPV strain virulence were detected by formation of plaques in cell culture. Two strains that consistently formed plaques killed adult mallards while non-plaque forming strains killed hatchling but not adult mallards. Based on mortality after exposure to the Lake Andes strain, blue-winged teal, then wood ducks and redheads were highly susceptible, muscovies and gadwalls moderately susceptible, mallards and Canada geese less susceptible, and pintails the least susceptible. Mean death times were significantly (P < 0.01) different between adult muscovies (4.5 days) versus mallards and Canada geese (5.8 days each). Mean death time of the virulent Lake Andes and Minnesota strains were shorter (P < 0.05) than for the other four, less virulent DPV strains. Four of the less virulent strains killed hatchling but not adult mallards. Susceptibility to mortality was dependent upon age and route of inoculation. The intramuscular route of inoculation required the least amount of virus to kill mallard and muscovy ducks, the intranasal and conjunctival routes required more virus, and the oral route the most virus. This study was conducted from 1974 to 1977 between the months of September and April, with the exception of two titrations conducted in early May at the University of Wisconsin Department of Veterinary Science and the Charmany research facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
991	8687999	Toxicity and oxidative stress of different forms of organic selenium and dietary protein in mallard ducklings.	Hoffman DJ, Heinz GH, LeCaptain LJ, Eisemann JD, Pendleton GW	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1996 Jul;31(1):120-7	 doi: 101007/BF00203916	Concentrations of over 100 ppm (mg/kg) selenium (Se) have been found in aquatic plants and insects associated with irrigation drainwater and toxicity to fish and wildlife. Composition of diet for wild ducklings can vary in selenium-contaminated environments. Earlier studies have compared toxicities and oxidative stress of Se as selenite to those of seleno-DL-methionine (DL) in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). This study compares DL, seleno-L-methionine (L), selenized yeast (Y) and selenized wheat (W). Day-old mallard ducklings received an untreated diet (controls) containing 75% wheat (22% protein) or the same diet containing 15 or 30 ppm Se in the above forms except for 30 ppm Se as W. After 2 weeks, blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical assays and Se analysis. All forms of selenium caused significant increases in plasma and hepatic glutathione peroxidase activities. Se as L at 30 ppm in the diet was the most toxic form, resulting in high mortality (64%) and impaired growth (>50%) in survivors and the greatest increase in ratio of oxidized to reduced hepatic glutathione (GSH). Se as both L and DL decreased the concentrations of hepatic GSH and total thiols. Se as Y accumulated the least in liver (approximately 50% of other forms) and had less effect on GSH and total thiols. In a second experiment, in which the basal diet was a commercial duck feed (22% protein), survival was not affected by 30 ppm Se as DL, L, or Y and oxidative effects on GSH metabolism were less pronounced than with the wheat diet.
992	8761986	Do craniocervical and jaw motor nuclei receive input from the same population of reticular premotor neurons- A double labeling tracing study in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Tellegen AJ, Dubbeldam JL	Neurosci Lett	 1996 May 10;209(2):77-80	 doi: 101016/0304-3940(96)12621-5	As part of a study concerning the organization of premotor areas in the medullary reticular formation in birds we used a fluorescent retrograde double labeling technique to localize the premotor neurons of the trigeminal (mV) and supraspinal motor nucleus (SSp). Diamidino Yellow injections in mV and Fast Blue injections in SSp demonstrated that mV and SSp do not share premotor neurons, but the premotor neurons form a mixed population in the ventromedial part of the parvocellular reticular formation.
993	8727570	Dilution acidosis: evidence for a role of intracellular pH in the control of ventilation.	Kasserra CE, Jones DR	J Appl Physiol (1985)	 1996 May;80(5):1804-10	 doi: 101152/jappl19968051804	Acute hyperosmolality results in an extracellular dilution acidosis and hypercarbia that does not stimulate ventilatory compensation. The osmotic stress is also associated with shifts in water and electrolyte balance and an increase in intracellular pH. The alkaline intracellular pH was hypothesized to have a role in preventing a normal respiratory response to the extracellular acidosis and hypercarbia. Therefore, this study examined the effect of ion-exchange blockade on intra- and extracellular pH and ventilation during acute hyperosmolality in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) by using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and amiloride inhibited the development of the intracellular alkalosis that normally develops in muscle during acute hyperosmolality. Instead, exposure to hyperosmotic stress during ion-exchange blockade resulted in a significant acidosis both intracellularly and extracellularly. Arterial pH decreased 0.10 +/- 0.04 pH unit with a sucrose infusion after either blocker, and intracellular pH decreased 0.11 +/- 0.06 and 0.16 +/- 0.04 pH units with a sucrose infusion after DIDS and amiloride, respectively. Ventilation increased 79 +/- 28 and 122 +/- 100%, respectively, during acute hyperosmolality after ion-exchange blockade with either DIDS or amiloride. The results suggest that intracellular pH may play a role in the ventilatory response to acid-base perturbations. The data also indicate that both Cl-/HCO3- and Na+/H+ exchanges are involved in the development of the intracellular alkalosis during hyperosmotically induced extracellular acidosis.
994	8815101	PCR for detection of Clostridium botulinum type C in avian and environmental samples.	Franciosa G, Fenicia L, Caldiani C, Aureli P	J Clin Microbiol	 1996 Apr;34(4):882-5	 doi: 101128/jcm344882-8851996	A PCR was developed and applied for the detection of Clostridium botulinum type C in 18 avian and environmental samples collected during an outbreak of avian botulism, and the results were compared with those obtained by conventional methodologies based on the mouse bioassay. PCR and mouse bioassay results compared well (100%) after the enrichment of samples, but PCR results directly indicated the presence of this microorganism in six samples, while only one of these contained the type C botulinal neurotoxin before enrichment. The PCR assay was sensitive (limit of detection between 15 and 15 x 10(3) spores per PCR), specific (no amplification products were obtained with other clostridia), and rapid, since sonicated and heated samples provided enough template for amplification without any DNA purification. Eleven isolates of C. botulinum type C were recovered from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), grey herons (Ardea cinerea), and mud during investigation of this outbreak.
995	8762980	Expression of growth dynamic in the structure of periosteal bone in Anas platyrhynchos	Castanet J, Grandin A, Abourachid A, de Ricqles A	C R Acad Sci III	 1996 Apr;319(4):301-8		An experimental study of the periosteal bone growth in the mallard from 42 to 154 post hatching days shows: (1) a noticeable time difference in the local biological age of the diaphyseal cortices between various long bones; (2) great differences in their histological structures, at a given individual age, expressing commensurate differences in local growth rates. Those results emphasize the importance of local factors to interpret the typology of the primary (periosteal) bone tissues. Experimental results allow to quantify the relationships between bone tissue typology and the velocity of its radial deposition.
996	8722273	Exposure of wild waterfowl to Mycoplasma anatis.	Samuel MD, Goldberg DR, Thomas CB, Sharp P, Robb JR, Krapu GL, Nersessian BN, Kenow KP, Korschgen CE, Chipley WH, Conroy MJ	J Wildl Dis	 1996 Apr;32(2):331-7	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-322331	We developed an ELISA procedure to assess the presence of M. anatis-specific serum antibody in ducks. Sera from exposed and unexposed Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were used to standardize the ELISA and to establish reference ranges to classify ELISA results as exposed or not exposed. We conducted serological surveys of female waterfowl in the central and eastern United States between 1988 and 1992 to assess the frequency of exposure in wild waterfowl. Adult breeding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), wintering mallards, and black ducks (Anas rubripes) had high prevalences of exposure to M. anatis (25% to > 80%). In comparison, none of the breeding adult canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) had serum antibody levels indicating exposure. Approximately 50% of the juvenile mallards and black ducks were exposed to M. anatis by 8 months of age, indicating high transmission rates among wild birds.
997	9142338	The valva portalis renalis in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Mirabella N, Esposito V, Pelagalli GV	Acta Anat (Basel)	 1996;157(2):151-8		The morphology of the valva portalis renalis of the duck was investigated, using histological, SEM and TEM techniques. The wall thickness of the vena iliaca externa, the vena portalis renalis caudalis, the vena iliaca communis and the vena renalis caudalis was morphometrically evaluated. The blood pressure in these veins was measured using a three-way H2O manometer. The valva portalis renalis was composed primarily of epithelioid cells and lined with endothelium. Throughout the entire valva there was a dense complex of nerve structures made up of fibers and fiber bundles which also extended beneath the endothelium of the valva and around the subendothelial epithelioid cells. The wall thicknesses of the veins supplying the renal portal system (vena iliaca externa and vena portalis renalis caudalis) were greater than those of the vessels collecting the renal refluent venous blood (vena iliaca communis and vena renalis caudalis). In addition, the blood pressure values taken in the vena iliaca externa and the vena portalis renalis caudalis were much higher than those in the vena iliaca communis and the vena renalis caudalis. The above observations suggest that the renal portal system works at higher blood pressure levels than the general venous system and that the valva portalis renalis regulates its aperture in order to maintain a constant blood pressure and a continuous blood flow in the renal portal system vessels, hence avoiding damage to the renal parenchyma caused by pressure overloads.
998	8982813	Naturally occurring synapse degradation in the developing cerebellum of the mallard (Anas Platyrhynchos) and the Peking duck (Forma Domestica).	Teuchert-Noodt G, Dawirs RR	J Hirnforsch	 1996;37(4):547-60		In order to analyze remodelling of junctions as component of adaptive mechanism in the developing avian cerebellum, a silver-staining technique was applied which is highly sensitive towards the detection of lysosomal aggregations (LA) in degrading synapses. LA was quantified in ducks at incubation ages from day 21 to 28 and from hatching up to 32 days. In the mallard, LA increased gradually throughout the whole investigation period, while in the Peking duck LA showed a dramatic increase in the perihatching period followed by the beginning of a decline at about 3 weeks of age. In both species LA occurred initially in the superficial molecular layer prehatching followed by a succession of degradative events down to the granular layer. LA dynamics thus coincide with the outside-in proliferation and differentiation of granule cells during advanced cortical histogenesis. Light microscopy of Epon sections impregnated with silver indicated that granule and Purkinje cell contacts were the center of LA dynamics. Electron microscopy confirmed that synapse degradation occurred predominantly with presynaptic elements of climbing, parallel and mossy afferents. As illustrated by the structural dynamics, maturation of cerebellar circuitry passes through a period of unbalanced synaptogenesis posthatching. Remarkably, the ongoing "critical period" of synaptogenesis in the mallard provides the opportunity for more differentiated behavioral pattern formation in the wild as compared to the domestic duckling.
999	8967077	The effect of final host species on invasive activity of Sobolevicanthus gracilis (Cestoda, Hymenolepididae) oncospheres to intermediate hosts (Ostracoda)	Grytner-Ziecina B	Wiad Parazytol	 1996;42(2):181-4		Two species of ostracods: Heterocypris incongruens and Cypridopsis vidua were used as experimental intermediate hosts for Sobolevicanthus gracilis, with Anas platyrhynchos dom. and Gallus gallus as the two experimental final hosts. Three series of fourth-fold passages: in hens, from hens to ducks, and back into hens--via ostracods--were accomplished. The fourth series of passages--in turn to ducks--was carried out for confirmation the results obtained. The index of infective activity was calculated for each experimental series. It has been stated that the infective activity of oncospheres to H. incongruens differed from final host species to species, being clearly higher in larvae from hens then from ducks. No differences of the index depended on final host species were noticed in relation to C. vidua. The possible explanations of the results are discussed.
1000	8713040	Receptivity and susceptibility of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos), the Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), and their hybrid, the mule duck, to an experimental infection by Eimeria mulardi.	Sercy O, Nie K, Pascalon A, Fort G, Yvore P	Avian Dis	 1996 Jan-Mar;40(1):23-7		The receptivity and susceptibility of the Muscovy duck, the domestic duck, and their hybrid, the mule duck, toward an experimental infection by Eimeria mulardi were studied. To appraise their susceptibility, female ducklings were infected with a dose of 75,000 oocysts per duckling (bringing about a clinical coccidiosis). In another group, to compare the multiplication rates of the parasite in the three species of ducks, thus assessing their receptivity, an infection with 750 oocysts per duckling was realized. Eimeria mulardi develops in the three species of ducks. In each case, a significant decrease in growth in the contaminated group vs. the control group was noted, even though the Muscovy and the mule ducks were more susceptible to the contamination.

Boston S, Wobeser G, Gillespie M	J Wildl Dis	 1996 Jan;32(1):17-22	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-32117	Captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed wheat containing 5.8 ppm deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin) from an outbreak of Fusarium graminearium head-blight that occurred on grain crops in Manitoba, Canada, during 1993. There was no evidence of taste aversion to this grain during a 10-day palatability trial. No significant differences were detected in serum protein, calcium, glucose, creatinine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase or uric acid levels, blood packed cell volume, or body or organ weight, between ducks fed contaminated wheat and those fed uncontaminated wheat during a 14-day feeding trial. No gross or microscopic lesions were detected in birds fed contaminated wheat for 14 days. Based on these results, ducks will consume grain containing moderate levels of DON and short-term exposure to this grain will not result in obvious adverse effects.
1002	8627918	Effects of embedded tungsten-bismuth-tin shot and steel shot on mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Kraabel BJ, Miller MW, Getzy DM, Ringelman JK	J Wildl Dis	 1996 Jan;32(1):1-8	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-3211	We assessed the potential for embedded steel and tungsten-bismuth-tin (TBT) shot to adversely affect health of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Ducks were implanted with three number four steel (n = 19) or TBT (n = 20) shot pellets in their pectoral muscles. None of seven hematology parameters measured differed in response to treatment (P > or = 0.17). At necropsy 1, 2, 4, and 8 wk posttreatment, we observed only localized tissue reactions to embedded steel or TBT shot. Reactions differed grossly: after wk 1, embedded steel shot were enveloped in 0.5 to 2 mm grayish capsules, whereas TBT shot were surrounded by thinner (< 0.5 mm), translucent capsules. Corrosion of steel shot was apparent. Microscopic lesions associated with steel shot were characterized by moderate to severe histiocytic and lymphocytic inflammation and considerable particle deposition, whereas histiocytic inflammation was mild and particle deposition minimal in TBT lesions. Overall scores of inflammation at steel shot implant sites were greater (P < or = 0.043) than at TBT sites during wk 1 and 8. Inflammation at steel implant sites was relatively consistent over the 8-wk period, but decreased (P = 0.0017) at TBT sites by wk 8. Weights of steel shot recovered from muscle tissue declined logarithmically (R2 = 0.978, P = 0.0014) over 8 wk, but TBT shot weights remained unchanged (P = 0.255). Embedded TBT shot, as compared to steel, resisted corrosion and induced comparatively mild inflammatory responses in mallard muscle tissue. However, inflammatory reactions to both embedded steel and TBT shot were localized and had no detectable systemic effects on mallard health under experimental conditions.
1003	8579386	Toxicity of seleno-L-methionine, seleno-DL-methionine, high selenium wheat, and selenized yeast to mallard ducklings.	Heinz GH, Hoffman DJ, LeCaptain LJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1996 Jan;30(1):93-9	 doi: 101007/BF00211333	The toxicity of four chemical forms of selenium (seleno-L-methionine, seleno-DL-methionine, selenized yeast, and high selenium wheat) was compared in day-old mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos). In the first experiment, in which the basal diet was 75% wheat, survival after 2 weeks was lower for ducklings fed 30 micrograms/g selenium as seleno-L-methionine (36%) than for ducklings fed 30 micrograms/g selenium as seleno-DL-methionine (100%) or 30 micrograms/g selenium from high selenium yeast (88%). The concentration of selenium at 2 weeks in the livers of survivors was similar for ducklings fed 15 micrograms/g selenium as seleno-DL-methionine (12 micrograms/g, wet weight), seleno-L-methionine (11 micrograms/g), and high selenium wheat (11 micrograms/g), but was lower when the selenium came from selenized yeast (6.2 micrograms/g). When fed 30 micrograms/g selenium from the various sources, the selenium concentrations in liver were 20 micrograms/g for seleno-DL-methionine, 19 micrograms/g for seleno-L-methionine, and 9.9 micrograms/g for selenized yeast. In a second experiment, in which the basal diet was a commercial duck feed, survival after 2 weeks was 100% in ducklings fed 30 micrograms/g selenium as seleno-DL-methionine, seleno-L-methionine, or selenized yeast. Selenium concentrations in liver were similar for ducklings fed the 30-micrograms/g selenium diets as the DL or L forms of selenomethionine (27 and 25 micrograms/g), but lower for ducklings fed selenized yeast (13 micrograms/g).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1004	8544048	Efficacy of praziquantel in natural populations of mallards infected with avian schistosomes.	Reimink RL, DeGoede JA, Blankespoor HD	J Parasitol	 1995 Dec;81(6):1027-9		In 1991, mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) on North and South Lake Leelanau in Leelanau Co., Michigan were trapped, examined for natural infections of avian schistosomes, and treated with praziquantel. Prevalence of infection from the 113 birds recaptured in 1992 was compared with that of the previous year on these 2 inland lakes after some of the birds were treated. Infections were determined by examining diluted fecal samples for hatched schistosome miracidia. Approximately 15% of the 366 birds captured the first year homed the second and made up about 27% of the resident mallard population. Of the birds treated in 1991, only 1.8% showed an infection in 1992 compared with 14.6% for previously untreated birds. These data indicate that praziquantel is an effective therapeutic agent for reducing natural infections of the parasite in mallards. Furthermore, yearly treatment of mallards at specific sites may not be necessary for effective control of swimmer's itch on North and South Lake Leelanau.
1005	7640300	The duck gene for alpha B-crystallin shows evolutionary conservation of discrete promoter elements but lacks heat and osmotic shock response.	Wistow G, Graham C	Biochim Biophys Acta	 1995 Aug 22;1263(2):105-13	 doi: 101016/0167-4781(95)00087-w	The gene for alpha Beta-crystallin from a bird (the domestic duck, Anas platyrhynchos) has been cloned and sequenced to allow comparison with its mammalian homologues. The duck gene has the same general structure as those of humans and rodents although, unlike those of mammals, the duck gene has two polyadenylation signals at the 3' end. The most interesting comparisons are in the 5'flanking promoter regions. In contrast to the broad conservation of promoter sequence among mammals, only two significant blocks and a few smaller elements have been conserved during evolution in the more distantly related avian gene. Block 1 (-350/-308) corresponds to alpha BE-2, a functional element defined in the mouse gene. Further downstream, block 2 (-98/-65) shows 27/33 identity among all three species but does not correspond to any previously defined element. Other regions are less well-conserved. In particular, putative heat-shock response elements of the mammalian alpha B-crystallin genes are absent from the duck gene. In contrast to the heat and osmotic stress-inducibility of mouse alpha B-crystallin in NIH 3T3 cells, duck alpha B-crystallin showed no inducibility in duck cells in culture. Thus, although high expression in lens is common to alpha B-crystallin genes in birds and mammals, other modes of expression appear to be taxon-specific.
1006	8592358	The occurrence of mycoplasmas in selected wild North American waterfowl.	Goldberg DR, Samuel MD, Thomas CB, Sharp P, Krapu GL, Robb JR, Kenow KP, Korschgen CE, Chipley WH, Conroy MJ, et al.	J Wildl Dis	 1995 Jul;31(3):364-71	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-313364	We determined the prevalence of mycoplasma infection in breeding mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and canvasback (Aythya valisineria) hens and their broods from the central United States (1988 to 1990); and wintering American black duck (Anas rubripes) and mallard hens from the eastern United States (1990 to 1993). Mycoplasmas were isolated by culturing tracheal swabs from 656 live birds and tissue samples from 112 dead waterfowl. Nine (18%) of 51 mycoplasma isolates were identified as Mycoplasma anatis; M. anatis was recovered from four mallards, a black duck, and a gadwall (Anas strepera) duckling. Nineteen (37%) of 51 mycoplasma isolates were identified as Mycoplasma cloacale; these isolates were obtained from mallard, canvasback, and black duck adults, and from a mallard duckling. Additional unspeciated mycoplasmas were isolated from mallards, black ducks, and one canvasback.
1007	8592347	Vitamin A status of wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) wintering in Saskatchewan.	Honour S, Kennedy S, Trudeau S, Wobeser G	J Wildl Dis	 1995 Jul;31(3):289-98	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-313289	Vitamin A status of wild male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) overwintering in Saskatchewan, Canada was determined. Vitamin A levels < 0.2 micrograms hepatic retinyl palmitate/g liver, occurred in 6% and 25% of male mallards sampled in 1991 to 1992 and 1992 to 1993, respectively. There was no temporal trend in vitamin A levels over either winter. Squamous metaplastic lesions, commonly associated with vitamin A deficiency in domestic animals, were not observed in any bird; hence, they were not a good indicator of vitamin A status in wild mallards. Serum retinol was not a good indicator of vitamin A status in wild mallards. Many mallards in good body condition had low vitamin A levels; thus, we propose that good body condition and ample fat stores are not indicative of overall health of the bird.
1008	8592346	Experimental vitamin A deficiency in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos): lesions and tissue vitamin A levels.	Honour SM, Trudeau S, Kennedy S, Wobeser G	J Wildl Dis	 1995 Jul;31(3):277-88	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-313277	Captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), fed an all-grain diet for up to 5 months during the winters of 1991 to 1992 and 1992 to 1993, developed lesions of squamous metaplasia; some had no detectable hepatic vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency in mallards was defined as hepatic levels of retinyl palmitate < 2 micrograms/g liver. Lesions were found only in ducks with low levels of hepatic vitamin A, but not all ducks with these low levels of hepatic vitamin A had histological lesions. The prevalence of lesions in the esophagus was greatest cranially and caudally and less common in the central region. Palatine salivary glands rarely were affected. Mallards with liver stores > 600 micrograms of hepatic retinyl palmitate per g liver, fed a diet deficient in vitamin A were unlikely to become deficient over a 5 month period. Birds fed an all-grain diet had significantly lower vitamin A concentrations in their liver compared to those fed an all-grain diet with vitamin A added. Liver weight, when corrected for body size, did not affect vitamin A concentration. Serum retinol levels were conserved over a large range of hepatic vitamin A levels but levels below 300 micrograms retinol/l were useful in detecting vitamin A deficiency in captive mallards. Based on the findings, the presence of lesions provides a conservative measure of vitamin A status in ducks and tissue levels should be measured in instances when mallards have questionable vitamin A status.
1009	7775238	Uveal malignant melanoma in a duck.	Gilger BC, McLaughlin SA, Smith P	J Am Vet Med Assoc	 1995 May 15;206(10):1580-2		An adult male Muscovy (Cairina moschata) X Peking (Anas platyrhynchos) duck had a primary malignant uveal melanoma with periocular extension involving the left eye. The periocular mass displaced the globe 1.5 cm laterally. Thoracic metastasis of the ocular neoplasm infiltrated the pectoral muscles, rib cage, and cranial lung lobe on the left side, causing diminished voluntary motion of the left wing. The left orbit was exenterated, but tumor regrowth was evident within 2 weeks. This case was unusual because melanocytic neoplasms are rare in birds.

1011	8583635	Influenza A viruses isolated from waterfowl in two wildlife management areas of Pennsylvania.	Alfonso CP, Cowen BS, van Campen H	J Wildl Dis	 1995 Apr;31(2):179-85	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-312179	A survey was conducted at two wildlife management areas of Pennsylvania (USA) to evaluate an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA) for the detection of avian influenza viruses (AIV) in cloacal swabs from waterfowl and to determine the influenza A virus subtypes and the distribution of these viruses among waterfowl. We collected 330 cloacal swabs from hunter-killed waterfowl in the fall of 1990 and from cage-captured waterfowl in the summer of 1991. Thirty-one hemagglutinating agents were isolated by chicken embryo inoculation (CEI) of which 27 were influenza A viruses and four Newcastle disease viruses (NDV). The prevalence of AIV infection was 8.2%. Compared to CEI, AC-ELISA was only 15% sensitive and 61% specific. Based on the distribution of AIV by species of waterfowl, mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American wigeons (Anas americana) were at equal risk of AIV infection even though most of the AIV isolates came from mallards. Although significant crude effects of sampling site and season on AIV recovery could be established, juvenile age was identified as the primary risk factor of AIV recovery. Twelve AIV subtypes were identified by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) tests. The most prevalent subytpes were H4N8 and H6N8. We concluded that AC-ELISA was not useful for the detection of AIV in cloacal swabs from waterfowl and that CEI, HI, and NI tests remain as the method of choice for AIV screening in waterfowl. Based on the results AIV infected preferentially the young which represent the high risk group in waterfowl populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1012	8583634	Effects of Mycoplasma anatis and cold stress on hatching success and growth of mallard ducklings.	Samuel MD, Goldberg DR, Thomas CB, Sharp P	J Wildl Dis	 1995 Apr;31(2):172-8	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-312172	We inoculated game-farm mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) eggs and 1-day-old birds with Mycoplasma anatis to determine its effect on hatching success and growth rates of ducklings. Inoculations of eggs reduced hatching success, hatchling size, and duckling growth rates, compared to controls. Intratracheal inoculations of 1-day-old birds did not affect growth rates. Hatchlings and 1-day-old ducklings grew much slower for the first 7 to 10 days when raised at 17 to 19 C, compared to controls raised at 30 to 35 C. The effect of cold stress on growth was greater than the effect of M. anatis infection; we found no synergistic effects between cold stress and M. anatis infection.
1013	7793009	Pathogenesis of avian mycobacteriosis in the domestic goose (Anser anser f. domestica) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica)	Hejlicek K, Treml F	Vet Med (Praha)	 1995 Apr;40(4):117-21		Experimental infections enabled to test susceptibility of the goose and duck to M. avium. After intramuscular implantation of M. avium suspension, local lesions were observed at the spot of puncture in the geese, and miliary tuberculosis of spleen in 35 days, as well as miliary tuberculosis of liver after 69 days. In the ducks, local lesions were found at the spot of puncture in 35 days and miliary tuberculosis of liver and spleen in 69 days. Cultivation demonstrated mycobacteria in various tissues and organs since day 12 after infection. Peroral infection with contaminated feed caused lesions in spleen and intestine in the geese in 106 days, and then in liver and lungs in 133 days. The ducks had lesions in the intestine in 106 days, and in liver and spleen in 133 and 136 days, resp. Cultivation proved sporadic mycobacteria in liver, spleen, lungs and/or bone marrow and brain in both species. No tuberculous lesions were observed in the geese or ducks within 253 days of the experiment after infections by contacts with the TBC fowl. Cultivation demonstrated sporadic mycobacteria in liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs and bone marrow. The goose and the duck are very resistant to M. avium infection. The duck seems to be less susceptible than the duck.
1014	7733242	Adaptive differentiation of avian exocrine cells alters their pHi response to mAChR activation.	Bentz C, Hildebrandt JP	Am J Physiol	 1995 Apr;268(4 Pt 1):C944-51	 doi: 101152/ajpcell19952684C944	Muscarinic receptor-mediated changes in intracellular pH (pHi) were measured in isolated 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-loaded cells, suspended in bicarbonate-containing media, from the exocrine nasal gland of freshwater-fed ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos). The pHi recovery from an acid load was sensitive to amiloride, required sodium ions in the external medium, and was independent of added bicarbonate. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the pHi recovery was mediated by a Na+/H+ exchanger. Muscarinic activation of cells resulted in a sustained cytosolic alkalinization that was sensitive to atropine and that was blocked by amiloride. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or inhibition of protein phosphatases mimicked the effect of receptor activation on pHi, whereas inhibitors of PKC blocked the response, indicating that phosphorylation of a major pHi control mechanism results in a shift of pHi to more alkaline values. In contrast, fully differentiated salt gland cells isolated from nasal glands of salt-stressed ducklings responded to muscarinic receptor activation with a transient cytosolic acidification. These findings raise the question whether the cytosolic alkalinization in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-activated naive cells may serve as a signal or a permissive factor for the initiation of adaptive growth and/or differentiation processes observed in the salt glands of salt-stressed birds.
1015	7893758	Linkage and expression of the argininosuccinate lyase/delta-crystallin genes of the duck: insertion of a CR1 element in the intergenic spacer.	Li X, Wistow GJ, Piatigorsky J	Biochim Biophys Acta	 1995 Mar 14;1261(1):25-34	 doi: 101016/0167-4781(94)00211-k	delta-Crystallin is the major component of the lenses of most birds and reptiles. In the chicken there are two closely linked, tandemly oriented genes. Almost all of the delta-crystallin of the embryonic chicken lens is produced by the 5' delta 1 gene. This high lens activity has been attributed to an enhancer in intron 3. The 3' delta 2 gene encodes the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) which is expressed at a low level in the chicken lens. Both chicken delta-crystallin genes are also expressed slightly in heart and brain, with ASL/delta 2 predominating over delta 1. In the duck (Anas platyrhynchos), ASL/delta 2-crystallin serves as both enzyme and crystallin, resulting in very high levels of ASL activity in the lens. Here we show by genomic cloning that the ASL/delta- crystallin locus is highly conserved between duck and chicken, with the two duck delta-crystallin genes closely linked in tandem. The 4.6 kbp intergenic spacer in the duck locus is 79% identical to the 4 kbp chicken spacer, except for the existence of a 615 bp CR1 element, highly reiterated in the duck genome, 1.8 kbp upstream of the duck ASL/delta 2 gene. The CR1 sequence is a truncated LINE element containing the 3' half of an open reading frame for a retroviral pol-like reverse transcriptase. Sequence analysis revealed (i) that intron 3 of the duck ASL/delta 2 gene is very similar (80%) to intron 3 of the chicken delta 1 and ASL/delta 2 genes, especially in the region of the chicken delta 1 enhancer core (93% identical) and (ii) that the 3' boundary of exon 2 of the duck ASL/delta 2 gene has undergone a recent splice-site slippage event, resulting in a two amino acid insertion in the encoded polypeptide. Finally, reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction experiments established that both delta-crystallin genes are equally expressed to a high level in the embryonic duck lens; by contrast, both delta-crystallin genes produce a low amount of mRNA in the heart and brain of the embryonic duck, with the enzymatically active ASL/delta 2 being preferentially expressed.
1016	15091521	Accumulation in and effects of lead and cadmium on waterfowl and passerines in northern Idaho.	Blus LJ, Henny CJ, Hoffman DJ, Grove RA	Environ Pollut	 1995;89(3):311-8	 doi: 101016/0269-7491(94)00069-p	Waterfowl and passerines in northern Idaho in 1987 had high levels of lead in their blood and tissues that originated primarily from mining and smelting activities. Four Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and one common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) found dead contained 8 to 38 microg/g (wet mass) of lead in their livers. These levels exceed the lower lethal limit of 5 microg/g in experimental birds. Two of the Canada geese (one each from the contaminated and reference areas) died with ingested lead shotgun pellets (shot) in their gizzards, whereas the other three birds from the contaminated area contained no ingested shot and evidently died from ingesting environmental lead in sediment or biota. Lead burdens in most American robins (Turdus migratorius) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were high, whereas those in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were slightly elevated. Lead accumulated to potentially hazardous levels in blood and tissues of some nestling robins (maxima of 0.87 microg/g in blood and 5.6 microg/g in liver) and mallards (maxima of 10.2 microg/g in blood and 2.8 microg/g in liver). In mallards, lead levels and associated physiological characteristics of blood were significantly different in juveniles (HY) versus adults (AHY). Activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) was about 87 to 95% lower than values for control birds in experimental studies. Activity of ALAD was significantly inversely correlated with blood lead levels. Cadmium was detected in kidneys of most birds, but even the maximum concentration of 7.5 microg/g in an AHY mallard was below known harmful levels.
1017	9319469	Hydroplaning by ducklings: overcoming limitations to swimming at the water surface	Aigeldinger T, Fish F	J Exp Biol	 1995;198(Pt 7):1567-74	 doi: 101242/jeb19871567	Rapid escape behavior by mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings is restricted to burst swimming at the water surface. Maximum speed may be limited because of the pattern of waves created as the duckling's body moves through the water (hull speed). Burst speeds for 9-day-old ducklings were compared with predicted hull speeds, based on the waterline length of ducklings either resting in water or actively swimming. Kinematic analysis of video tapes showed a mean maximum burst speed of 1.73 m s-1, which was four times greater than the predicted hull speed. At burst velocities, stroke frequency was 1.9 times higher than the stroke frequency measured during steady low-speed paddling. Transition to burst speeds from steady paddling occurred near predicted hull speed. The paddling motions of the webbed feet were used to generate both thrust and lift. By using lift to raise the body above the water surface, the influence of waves in restricting maximum swimming speed is negated. The duckling's body becomes a planing type of hull and skims on the water surface.
1018	8568228	Regional differences in the blood-brain-barrier of the subfornical organs of rats and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Schmid HA	J Hirnforsch	 1995;36(4):565-74		Recently published electrophysiological data investigated the effect of blood borne and brain intrinsic substances on the activity of neurons in the duck subfornical organ (SFO). This study defines histologically the region in the duck SFO, where blood borne substances can possibly influence neuronal activity. Intravenous injection of Evans blue, a dye which labels brain structures devoid of a blood brain barrier (BBB), resulted in diffuse labelling of the duck SFO from the anterior commissure to the end of the organ in rostrocaudal extension. In addition, specifically labelled neurons could be observed just rostral to the diffuse Evans blue labelling and in an area dorsomedial to the large central blood vessel. The majority of the somata of these heavily stained neurons were located inside the BBB, whereas in the areas with diffuse Evans blue labelling, thus being outside the BBB, labelled cells were rarely observed. Intravenous injection of Evans blue in rats resulted similarly in diffuse labelling of the parenchyma of the medial and caudal part of the SFO, with only a few, but heavily stained cells with fusiform somata. The rostral region of the rat SFO, which is known to have a functional BBB, shows hardly any diffuse labelling, but there the majority of neurons show strong Evans blue fluorescence. It is concluded that the heavily labelled somata inside the BBB have axonal or dendritic projections to BBB-free areas, where they can take up the dye. This study gives a functional description of the extension of the SFO areas without a BBB of rats and ducks. It is concluded that blood borne agents can affect those SFO neurons which have their somata located outside the BBB as well as those located inside the BBB which have terminals projecting to BBB free regions.
1019	7620877	Domestication and plasticity of brain organization in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Ebinger P	Brain Behav Evol	 1995;45(5):286-300	 doi: 101159/000113557	The sizes and histological differentiation of structures in the central nervous system of wild and domestic ducks were compared using allometric methods. Whole brain volume is 14.3% less in domestic ducks than in wild birds, and the size of certain brain structures is more variable in domestic ducks than in the wild birds. These findings are consistent with results of studies in other domestic birds and in domestic mammals. Although the brain subdivision volumes are not reduced to the same extent, the relative composition of the brain is maintained in domestic ducks. The overall reduction in rhombencephalic parts of the brain (16.3%) is greater than that in the prosencephalon (13.5%). Within sensory centers the nuclei of the trigeminal system undergo the most marked decrease (21.3%). Optic (13.3%) and limbic (11.1%) structures are less reduced, and the olfactory regions do not show any differences in volume compared to these regions in wild mallards. Reductions in the volumes of brain structures in domesticated animals have been thought to be processes of functional adaptation controlled by artificial selection. Our observations are discussed with regard to hypotheses about trends in domestication and evolutionary plasticity.
1020	7989756	One gene encodes the heavy chains for three different forms of IgY in the duck.	Magor KE, Higgins DA, Middleton DL, Warr GW	J Immunol	 1994 Dec 15;153(12):5549-55		IgY, the major Ab of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos), exists in two secreted forms and a transmembrane (TM) form. To investigate the genetic relationships of the multiple IgY we cloned the gene encoding the IgY (upsilon) heavy chains. The heavy chain of the smaller (5.7S) IgY, which lacks the third and fourth constant domains, results from the use of a unique terminal exon found in the intron between the second and third C region exons. Alternate pre-mRNA processing pathways also produce a full-length upsilon-chain and a TM form, each having four C region domains. Although the number of secretory exons and the inferred positions of intramolecular disulfide bonds indicate structural similarity between IgY and IgE, the TM exons of duck IgY share high sequence identity and a similar pattern of RNA processing with those of IgG. These results suggest that IgG and IgE may have diverged from an ancestral molecule resembling IgY.
1021	7768317	cDNA sequence and organization of the immunoglobulin light chain gene of the duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Magor KE, Higgins DA, Middleton DL, Warr GW	Dev Comp Immunol	 1994 Nov-Dec;18(6):523-31	 doi: 101016/s0145-305x(06)80006-6	A cDNA was cloned which encoded an immunoglobulin (Ig) light (L) chain of the White Pekin duck. The organization of the variable (V) and constant (C) domains was analyzed by genomic Southern blotting. The duck L chain gene has a similar chromosomal organization to that of the chicken, with a single lambda-like C region and multiple VL, hybridizing elements. The amino acid sequence of the VL region of the White Pekin duck L chain showed 88% identity with the Muscovy duck and 87% identity with the chicken, the JL region showed 92% identity with these species, and the CL region showed 88% identity with Muscovy duck and 66% with chicken. The constraints imposed by the gene-conversion mechanism of generating antibody diversity might account for the similarities of the avian V region sequences.
1022	7760480	Use of sentinel mallards for epizootiologic studies of avian botulism.	Rocke TE, Brand CJ	J Wildl Dis	 1994 Oct;30(4):514-22	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-304514	Captive-reared mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were used as sentinels to study the epizootiology of avian botulism at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, Willows, California (USA) from 1986 to 1989. Sentinel mallards were wing-clipped, and 40 to 50 birds were confined in 1.6-ha enclosures in 11 selected wetlands (pools). Enclosures were searched intensively three to four times weekly from July through October. Sick and dead wild and sentinel birds were collected, necropsied, and tested for type C botulism toxin. Botulism epizootics occurred in sentinel mallards in 1986, 1987, and 1989, but only a few isolated cases of botulism were detected in 1988. In most epizootics, botulism also was detected simultaneously in wild birds using the same pool outside the enclosure. Epizootics in sentinels were initiated and perpetuated in the absence of vertebrate carcasses. A sex-specific trend in the probability of intoxication was detected, with males contracting botulism at a higher rate than females. Daily mortality rates of sentinels during botulism epizootics ranged from 0.0006 to 0.0600, with a mean of 0.0190. These rates would result in the daily loss of 0.6 to 60 birds per thousand at risk. The use of sentinel birds provided an effective means of gathering site-specific epizootiologic data.
1023	7702525	Hemosporid parasitism of mallards at the southern periphery of their breeding range.	Fedynich AM, Pence DB	Avian Dis	 1994 Oct-Dec;38(4):885-6		Thin blood smears from 37 juvenile mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) collected in the Playa Lakes Region of Texas during summers 1990 and 1991 were examined for hemosporids. Only one bird was infected with a Plasmodium sp. Parasite intensity was seven per 10,000 erthrocytes. The low prevalence of Plasmodium sp. and the lack of other blood parasites in resident mallards suggests that hemosporid parasitism at the southern periphery of their breeding range is very different from that at the northern breeding grounds.
1024	7828009	Genetic parameters from factorial cross breeding in two duck strains (anas platyrhynchos) Brown Tsaiya and Pekin, for growth and fatty liver traits.	Rouvier R, Guy G, Rousselot-Paillet D, Poujardieu B	Br Poult Sci	 1994 Sep;35(4):509-17	 doi: 101080/00071669408417716	1. A total of 655 mule ducklings were produced in three hatches by artificial insemination of common duck females Brown Tsaiya and Pekin "Alienor" and of their 2 reciprocal crossbreds with Muscovy semen. 2. They were fed ad libitum until 6 weeks, then restricted to one meal per day until day 75 and afterwards preforce fed until day 84 and subsequently forced fed by 2 crammers, twice a day, from the age of 85 d and for a maximum of 13 d. 3. Body weight at hatching, 28 d, 56 d, 75 d, 84 d and at slaughter, the number of force-fed meals, the "paletot" weight, the fatty liver weight, the fat release rate after sterilisation of a 60 g portion of liver and the serous melting rate were measured individually. 4. Significant dam genotype and hatch effects were present for all traits. The crammer effect on force feeding traits was also significant. For mule ducks from Brown Tsaiya, Tsaiya x Pekin, Pekin x Tsaiya and Pekin dams respectively, mean body weight was 2356, 3219, 3137 and 3801 g at 12 weeks, "paletot" weight was 1585, 2111, 2110 and 2470 g, fatty liver weight was 441, 585, 563 and 641 g, fat release rate was 35.1, 40.5, 38.2 and 46.0%. 5. The estimated differences between Pekin and Tsaiya genetic effects in their mule progeny were significant and in favour of the Pekin, except for the number of force fed meals and for the serous melting rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1025	7803160	Location of premotor neurons of the motor nuclei innervating craniocervical muscles in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Tellegen AJ, Dubbeldam JL	Eur J Morphol	 1994 Aug;32(2-4):138-41		Reticular premotor neurons of craniocervical muscles in the duck were localized with the retrograde tracer HRP and the anterograde tracer WGA-HRP. In the reticular formation neck premotor neurons were found in the gigantocellular reticular nucleus and in the ventromedial part of the parvocellular reticular nucleus rostral to the obex, and caudal to the obex in the nucleus centralis ventralis of the medulla. Results were compared with premotor areas of jaw muscles. The ventromedial part of the parvocellular reticular formation contains neck as well as jaw premotor neurons. This area may serve as the neural substrate for the coordination of neck and jaw movements.
1026	7803159	The reticular premotor neurons of the jaw muscle motor nuclei in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Bout RG, Dubbeldam JL	Eur J Morphol	 1994 Aug;32(2-4):134-7		The trigeminal and facial motor nuclei in the mallard comprise several subnuclei which innervate tongue, jaw and other head muscles. The premotor cells of the subnuclei innervating jaw muscles are distributed in two longitudinal cell columns within the parvocellular reticular formation (RPc). The ventromedial part of RPc contains cells projecting to subnuclei innervating either jaw-closer muscles or jaw-opener muscles. In the dorsolateral part of RPc three subdivisions may be recognized: a rostral part which projects to two trigeminal subnuclei innervating jaw-closer muscles, an intermediate part which does not serve as premotor area for any of the jaw motor subnuclei and a caudal part of RPcdl which projects to the trigeminal and facial motor subnuclei innervating jaw-opener muscles. Exteroceptive information from mechanoreceptors in the beak reaches all three parts of RPCdl. Muscle spindles in jaw-closer muscles may influence the activity of premotor cells of jaw-opener muscles through their projection upon the caudal part of RPcdl.

Bergan JF, Radomski AA, Pence DB, Rhodes OE Jr	J Wildl Dis	 1994 Jul;30(3):351-8	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-303351	Tetrameres (Petrowimeres) striata is an uncommon and incompletely described nematode from North American and Eurasian waterfowl. Specimens collected from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from the Playa Lakes Region (PLR) in western Texas (USA), the mottled duck (A. platyrhynchos fulvigula) in Florida (USA), the mallard in the Amur River Basin of eastern Russia and the blue-winged teal (Anas discors) from western Texas (USA) provide the basis for redescription of T. (P.) striata. This species is differentiated from the closely related T. (P.) zakharowi and T. (P.) galericulata by the size of the left spicule and the prominent cuff on the proximal end of the right spicule. In mallards from the PLR, one to several adult males and a single female occurred within distended mucosal glands or, more rarely, in cystic cavities in the submucosal tissue of the proventriculus; intensities ranged from one to seven nematodes per host (mean +/- SE = 2.9 +/- 0.8). Infected proventricular gland mucosae were compressed as a result of pressure atrophy by the large gravid females. In addition to nematodes, some lesions also contained necrotic debris with inflammatory cells and were surrounded by an intense inflammatory response of eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, epithelioid cells and fibroblasts. Other lesions had little or no inflammatory response. Lesions in the submucosa were surrounded by a thin fibrous cyst with or without adjacent inflammatory cells.

Astorga RJ, Leon L, Cubero MJ, Arenas A, Maldonado A, Tarradas MC, Perea A	Avian Pathol	 1994 Jun;23(2):339-44	 doi: 101080/03079459408419001	The indirect ELISA was used to detect antibodies to influenzavirus A in the sera of wildfowl from the Donana National Park. Of the 712 birds examined, 44 (6.2%) were seropositive. Positive birds belonged to 10 of the 13 species studied. Infection rates varied widely: spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia, 32.2%), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos, 9.9%), gadwall (Anas strepera, 8.6%), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina, 8.1%), pochard (Aythya ferina, 6.4%), shoveler (Anas clypeata, 5%), great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus, 4.3%), avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta, 3.1%), grey heron (Ardea cinerea, 3.1%) and coot (Fulica atra, 0.8%). Although infection rates were not high, the wide range of avian species susceptible to influenzavirus A suggests circulation of the virus amongst wildfowl at Donana.

Rose TM, Schultz ER, Sasaki GC, Kolattukudy PE, Shoyab M	DNA Cell Biol	 1994 Jun;13(6):669-78	 doi: 101089/dna199413669	A computer-aided homology search of the GenBank nucleotide database using the amino acid sequence of human acyl CoA-binding protein (ACBP)/diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)-endozepine as a probe revealed that a genomic fragment containing the gene encoding the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase also contains sequences which encode the duck homolog of ACBP/DBI. The duck ACBP/DBI gene is positioned downstream of the thioesterase gene in a tail-to-tail orientation separated from the 3' end of the thioesterase gene by only several hundred nucleotides. Three exons were identified that have strong homology to the published cDNA sequences of human and bovine ACBP/DBI. These exons define all of the coding region except for the amino-terminal domain, which was subsequently cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The encoded amino acid sequence of the duck ACBP/DBI is 62-68% homologous to mammalian ACBP/DBI sequences. While the mammalian ACBP/DBI is expressed mainly in the liver, with smaller amounts in the brain and heart, mRNA transcripts of duck ACBP/DBI were detected only in the brain with no evidence for expression in the liver or heart. The close proximity of the genes for ACBP/DBI and S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase raises the possibility of co-regulation of expression.

Stephenson R, Jones DR, Bryan RM Jr	Am J Physiol	 1994 Apr;266(4 Pt 2):R1162-8	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19942664R1162	The cerebrovascular response to submergence asphyxia was studied in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos var.) by use of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) tracer [14C]isopropyliodoamphetamine and quantitative autoradiography. Blood flow of the whole brain was 158 +/- 14 (SE) ml.min-1 x 100 g-1 (n = 7) in control animals. There was a doubling of flow to 320 +/- 61 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1 (n = 6) during submergence asphyxia. The hypothesis that CBF is redistributed within the brain during asphyxia was not supported. There were no regional reductions in CBF during submergence asphyxia. Mean arterial blood pressure was similar (approximately 140 mmHg), but heart rate, arterial blood gas tensions, and arterial pH were significantly different in control and submerged ducks at the time CBF was measured. The differences in CBF among submerged animals correlated strongly with arterial PCO2 and mean arterial blood pressure. The smallest proportional difference in regional CBF between control and submerged ducks occurred in the ectostriatum (+141%) and the largest in the locus ceruleus (+241%). The largest absolute difference in regional CBF was in the nucleus ruber (+322 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1). These are the first measurements of blood flow in discrete nuclei and regions of the avian brain.

Tai C, Poivey JP, Rouvier R	Br Poult Sci	 1994 Mar;35(1):59-64	 doi: 101080/00071669408417670	1. Fertility traits in 348 Brown Tsaiya female ducks were analysed following intergeneric crossbreeding by artificial insemination (AI) with pooled Muscovy semen. The females descended from 18 sires and 107 dams. At 50 weeks of age, the ducks were intra-vaginally inseminated once with 0.03 ml of pooled Muscovy semen. Subsequently eggs were collected for 15 d and set for incubation up to candling 10 d later. 2. Average fertility decreased from 87% at day 2 after AI to 53% at day 6 and less than 7% from day 10 onwards. 3. The best criterion of selection for duration of fertility seems to be the number of fertile eggs from 2nd day up to the 15th day after AI. Heritability estimates for this trait were hs2 = 0.29 +/- 0.18., hD2 = 0.38 +/- 0.22.
1032	8173581	Trichobilharzia franki n. sp.--the cause of swimmer's dermatitis in southwest German dredged lakes	Muller V, Kimmig P	Appl Parasitol	 1994 Feb;35(1):12-31		Ocellate furcocercariae from the lymnaeid snail Radix auricularia have been identified as causative agents of swimmer's itch, which has become increasingly common in the 'Tunisee' near Freiburg. On an average 11.0%, maximally 25.0%, of the snails were parasitized with these trematode larvae. The Trichobilharzia parasitizing rate in the intermediate hosts found here was thus approximately 10-100 times higher than the Trichobilharzia prevalence described so far. Dwarf mallards (Anas platyrhynchos, blood red) were experimentally infected with Trichobilharzia cercariae from the 'Tunisee'. From the 13th day p.i. miracidia could be found in their faeces by means of the hatching method. The trematode eggs had the shape of an elongated spindle, with a pointed and a rounded end. The sexually differentiated adult worms were localized only in the hepatic and enteric veins. They had an average length of 4.0 mm (3.2-4.6 mm) and a width of 125 microns. Their tegument was strongly folded and had tegumental spines in the oral and ventral suckers, in males in addition along the canalis gynaecophorus. The most striking internal organ was the gut filled with hematin and separated in 2 caeca at its anterior end. Its form and localisation as well as those of the sexual organs were important criteria for the differentiation of the different Trichobilharzia species. The Trichobilharzia species found in the 'Tunisee' clearly differed from Trichobilharzia szidati both morphologically and physiologically. The latter has been considered, until now, to be the main causative agent of swimmer's itch in Germany. Moreover, the adult trematodes from the 'Tunisee' could not be associated with any other species of this genus. We propose therefore the name Trichobilharzia franki n. sp. for the species from the Tunisee.
1033	8142956	Experimental infection of the mule duck by Eimeria mulardi sp. nov.: effects on body weight and modifications of different hematologic and biochemical parameters	Pascalon-Pekelniczky A, Chauve CM, Gauthey M	Vet Res	 1994;25(1):37-50		Eleven-day-old female Mule ducks (Cairina moschata x Anas platyrhynchos) were individually infected per os with a single inoculation containing 10(4), 10(5) or 10(6) sporulated oocysts of E mulardi, or kept as uninfected controls. No mortality was observed. Growth rate was not modified at lower doses, but was reduced in the other 2 groups, with weight loss on d 7 post inoculation (PI). Blood was detected in feces by chemical characterization of hemoglobin as early as d 3 PI with the highest infecting dose, while oocyst excretion began on d 6 PI in all infected groups. With 10(5) and 10(6) oocysts, the authors observed a significant increase in sedimentation rate and a slight anemia. Total protein and lipid concentrations in the plasma decreased in the 3 infected groups. These results show the pathogenic effect of E mulardi in Mule duckling, with dose-dependent changes. All parameters, except sedimentation rate, showed maximal variations during the acute phase of infection, between d 6 and d 9 PI, and returned to normal values early, in relation to the infecting dose, except that the weight remained lower than in the uninfected group at the final control (d 28 Pl). These perturbations have been described in avian coccidiosis.
1034	7983373	Organization of the motor innervation of craniocervical muscles in the Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos L.	Zijlstra C, Dubbeldam JL	J Hirnforsch	 1994;35(3):425-40		The organization of the motorsystem supplying the craniocervical muscles in the mallard was investigated. Firstly, the distribution of peripheral nerves supplying these muscles was macroscopically examined. Each muscle was found to be innervated by several spinal nerves, and each nerve to contact various muscles. Secondly, the position of neck motoneurons was studied by means of retrograde tracer transport. Labeled motoneurons were found in the supraspinal nucleus of the lower brainstem and in the ventral horn of the upper cervical cord. Each of the craniocervical muscles appeared to be innervated by a separate motorpool, and pools supplying different muscles were found to overlap considerably. Despite this overlap, some organization pattern could be recognized: the most ventral muscles are innervated by motoneurons that occupy dorsomedial positions, while more dorsal muscles are innervated by neurons at ventro-lateral positions. Thirdly, the arrangement of motoneurons innervating different parts of three craniocervical muscles was investigated by means of retrograde tracer transport. This indicated that each muscle part is also innervated by a separate motor column, and that columns supplying parts of the same muscle have similar positions in transverse sections but are shifted with respect to each other in the longitudinal direction. The separate columns of one muscle mingle to form one main motorpool. These results are discussed with respect to observations in other animals.
1035	7928022	Heart and body growth in ducks.	Gille U, Salomon FV	Growth Dev Aging	 1994 Summer;58(2):75-81		Growth of body and heart weight in drakes was measured to 154 days of age in Mallards, 2 lines of White Pekins (Anas platyrhynchos), Muscovys (Cairina moschata), and a Muscovy x White Pekin cross. Allometric heart growth was slightly negative in the Mallard and its domestic forms (allometric exponent 0.895 < b < 0.943) whereas no significant difference from isometry was detected in Muscovy ducks and its cross. The relation between heart and body weight, using all stocks combined, yielded an exponent b = 0.937, being significantly smaller than 1. Coefficients of determination were high varying between 0.981 and 0.992. Breaks, i.e. changes of the slope during the postnatal development, could not be detected in any of the stocks. Using the modified Janoschek growth curve, both heart and body weight showed a similar growth pattern with respect to time. The degree of maturity at hatching and at the point of inflection (ui) was similar within stocks for both weights. This was also true for the age at maximum growth. The similarity between heart and whole body growth patterns, which is not found in most of the other internal organs, implies strong functional constraints. The ui values varied between 32 and 50% which should be taken into account when choosing an appropriate model. Differences among the various types of ducks resulting from their origin or domestication are discussed.
1036	8258848	Effect of intravenous inoculation of avian influenza virus on reproduction and growth in mallard ducks.	Laudert EA, Sivanandan V, Halvorson DA	J Wildl Dis	 1993 Oct;29(4):523-6	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-294523	An avian influenza virus isolate, A/Mallard/Ohio/184/86 (H5N1), was evaluated for its effects on reproduction in isolation-reared adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and growth rate in juvenile mallards after intravenous inoculation. There was a significant decrease in egg production in the experimental group during the first week after inoculation, but it returned to the normal production level during the second week. No effect was seen on egg weight, shape, or fertility. Ducklings receiving this influenza virus isolate did not differ from controls in their rate of growth.
1037	8220576	The effect of praziquantel on Trichobilharzia (Digenea, Schistosomatidae), a cause of swimmer's dermatitis in humans	Muller V, Kimmig P, Frank W	Appl Parasitol	 1993 Sep;34(3):187-201		Cases of swimmer's itch caused by cercariae of the genus Trichobilharzia have spread during the last years in Southwestern Germany and increased in intensity. The only consequence was to forbid swimming because no effective strategies are known which would be ecologically or financially acceptable. In this examination we therefore tried, by means of medication of ducks, the possible final hosts, to kill the different stages of Trichobilharzia in patency and prepatency in order to interrupt the parasitic cycle. For this the effectiveness of praziquantel on the parasitic stages in the final host (preadults, adults, eggs or fully developed miracidia) was tested in experimentally infected dwarf mallards (Anas platyrhynchos, hemerot.) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos). During therapy of ducks with patent Trichobilharzia infection, onefold or twofold application of this drug (1 x 500 mg/duck, 1 x 300 mg/duck, 2 x 200 mg/duck) only prevented the releasing of eggs with hatchable miracidia for up to 24 h. Only a threefold application of 200 mg/duck in 24 h intervals led to a permanent reduction of detectable miracidia. Application of praziquantel in low doses (30 or 40 mg per duck and day) did not reduce the number of released miracidia. Medication with praziquantel led to a strong shift of adult worms located in the enteric veins of the ducks to the liver veins in a little as 3 h; examinations by scanning electron microscopy revealed changes in the worms' surface and damage of the tegument. During prepatency doses of 22.5 mg praziquantel per duck and day, given continuously for one week, were sufficient to completely stop the release of miracidia. In this low dosage, a special preparation of the bitter drug was voluntarily swallowed by the ducks, thus providing in principal a simple, cheap and ecologically sound method of controlling cercarial dermatitis.

Lee DC, Kim RY, Wistow GJ	J Mol Biol	 1993 Aug 20;232(4):1221-6	 doi: 101006/jmbi19931476	alpha B-crystallin is multifunctional, serving as both a major structural protein in the lens and a small heat-shock protein (shsp) in other tissues in mammals. Cloning and Northern analysis show similarly that alpha B-crystallin mRNA is present in all mature tissues examined in a bird (Anas platyrhynchos), although there are some differences in the pattern of transcripts seen. Interestingly, sequence analysis not only shows that duck alpha B-crystallin is a member of the shsp family, as expected, but that this family shares more distant similarity with another heat shock protein family, the highly conserved HSP70s of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This raises the possibility that large and small hsps may share structural and perhaps functional features.
1039	8257373	Biological and molecular characterization of H13N2 influenza type A viruses isolated from turkeys and surface water.	Laudert E, Sivanandan V, Halvorson D, Shaw D, Webster RG	Avian Dis	 1993 Jul-Sep;37(3):793-9		The pathogenicity potential of two H13N2 influenza viruses, one isolated from turkeys and the other isolated from surface water, was evaluated in turkeys, chickens, and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) after intracranial and oculonasal inoculation. Both isolates replicated in turkey poults, causing depressed weight gain, morbidity and mortality; both also caused histopathological lesions, such as mild to severe pancreatitis, hepatitis, and nephritis in turkeys. These isolates replicated in mallard ducklings but not in chickens. There was depressed weight gain in ducklings given the H13N2 isolate from water. Neither isolate caused morbidity or mortality in ducklings or chicks after inoculation.
1040	8257370	Comparative evaluation of tissue trophism characteristics in turkeys and mallard ducks after intravenous inoculation of type A influenza viruses.	Laudert E, Halvorson D, Sivanandan V, Shaw D	Avian Dis	 1993 Jul-Sep;37(3):773-80		Ten avian type A influenza viruses consisting of seven waterfowl-origin, one pheasant-origin, and two turkey-origin viruses were evaluated for their pathogenicity potential after intravenous inoculation into domestic turkeys and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The replicative abilities and tissue trophism properties of each virus isolate were examined in both species. The overall virus-isolation rate and histopathological lesion score were greater in the turkeys than in the ducks. The waterfowl-origin viruses caused more tissue damage in turkeys than in ducks but had a narrower tissue distribution range. The pheasant isolate was extremely pathogenic in turkeys but had limited distribution and little effect in ducks. The turkey isolates were more pathogenic in turkeys than in ducks. The pancreas was the most severely affected organ in turkeys, followed by kidney and liver. The spleen and bursa were the most commonly affected organs in ducks.
1041	7690719	An examination of the immune system of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) for factors resembling some defined mammalian cytokines.	Higgins DA, Cromie RL, Srivastava G, Herzbeck H, Schluter C, Gerdes J, Diamantstein T, Flad HD	Dev Comp Immunol	 1993 Jul-Aug;17(4):341-55	 doi: 101016/0145-305x(93)90006-c	Duck lymphoblasts generated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) did not respond to recombinant or Jurkat cell line human interleukin (IL)-2 or possess surface antigens resembling mammalian IL-2 receptors or IL-1 beta. Supernatant fluids from normal and PHA-stimulated duck lymphocyte cultures, and normal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes, gave negative results in a range of assays for biological activity and immunochemical presence of factors resembling mammalian IL-1 and IL-2. However, supernatant fluids from LPS-stimulated duck monocytes contained IL-6-like activity (up to 35 units/mL) assessed on the 7TD-1 murine cell line. We were unable to demonstrate mRNA that would hybridize to cDNA probes for human IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in extracts of blood and lymphoid organs from normal and antigen-stimulated ducks. Because homologous serum or plasma is essential for duck lymphocytes and macrophages to respond to mitogens in vitro, we asked whether this growth-factor-like activity might be caused by substances resembling mammalian cytokines. Serum and plasma were examined for activity consistent with IL-1 and IL-6 on mammalian target cells. None was detected. Instead, both serum and plasma contained inhibitors of human IL-1 beta and IL-6, detected at dilutions up to 1:100. Inhibition by serum was heat (56 degrees C, 30 min) labile but inhibition by plasma was heat stable. The identities and biological functions of these inhibitors remain to be defined.
1042	24201552	Survival and behaviour of captive Mallard broods exposed to carbofuran-sprayed vegetation: a field experiment.	Martin PA, Forsyth DJ	Ecotoxicology	 1993 Jun;2(2):79-92	 doi: 101007/BF00119433	: A field study was undertaken to determine the effects of exposure to vegetation sprayed with carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranylmethyl carbamate) on the survival and behavior of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings. Pairs of captive hens with newly hatched broods of five to eight ducklings were released into sprayed or control 200 m long walkways leading directly to 0.1 ha pond enclosures. Carbofuran was applied at 132 and 264 g a.i. ha(-1) during five and four replicate trials, respectively. Broods were observed during the walk, and activity was recorded systematically during four 2-h periods over the following two days. Dead or abandoned ducklings were retrieved and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was determined. Carbofuran did not affect the rate of duckling loss on the day of exposure at either spray rate compared with that of controls (3/34 versus 3/38 ducklings and 3/31 versus 0/31 ducklings, respectively). Nevertheless, one and three of the abandoned or dead ducklings in the low and high spray-rate trials, respectively, exhibited depression of brain AChE activity associated with mortality caused by anticholinesterase compounds (16 to 47% of mean control activity). Although no significant differences were detected in duckling behaviour between treated and control broods at either exposure level, treated broods tended to spend a larger proportion of time hidden in emergent vegetation. The ingestion of carbofuran by ducklings walking through sprayed vegetation appears to be the critical mode of intake, with dermal absorption being minimal.
1043	8373659	Are Merkel and Grandry cells two varieties of the same cell in birds-	Toyoshima K	Arch Histol Cytol	 1993 Jun;56(2):167-75	 doi: 101679/aohc56167	For over a century it has been held that the Grandry corpuscle and the Merkel corpuscle are unique sensory organs in aquatic and nonaquatic birds, respectively. In other words, the Grandry and the Merkel cells are two varieties of the same receptor cell and never coexist together. Contrary to what has been believed, we found unmistakable Merkel cells in addition to Grandry cells in the lingual mucosa of the duck, Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica, an unprecedented observation in an aquatic bird. This study concerns the fine structure of these cells in the tongue of the duck. Although some ultrastructural features are shared by the Grandry and the Merkel cells, i.e., the presence of numerous dense-cored granules and microvillous projections at the cell surface, the morphology of these two types of cells clearly differ, especially in their size. Cells suggestive of stages intermediate between these two cells have never been recognizable. The present study indicates that the Grandry and the Merkel cells are not two varieties of the same cell in birds. It is suggested that the Merkel cell may exist in every vertebrate species, while the Grandry cell is unique to aquatic birds.

Hildebrandt JP, Shuttleworth TJ	J Membr Biol	 1993 Apr;133(2):183-90	 doi: 101007/BF00233798	Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activation in isolated cells from the nasal salt gland of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) results in a rapid increase in the rate of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and pronounced intracellular calcium signals. Both responses can be elicited by treating these cells with fluoroaluminate (AlF4-) indicating the involvement of a heterotrimeric G protein in the transmembrane signaling process. To characterize this G protein, electrophoretically separated membrane proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters and probed with peptide-antibodies raised against portions of different alpha-subunits of mammalian G proteins. We could demonstrate the presence of at least four different G proteins in salt gland cell membranes. Two of these proteins (40 and 41 kD) were ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin and were recognized by an antiserum against a common sequence in all G protein alpha-subunits. One protein (46 kD) was a cholera toxin-substrate and was recognized by a Gs-specific antiserum; the other (42 kD) was recognized by Gq-specific antisera and was resistant to ADP-ribosylation. Since the initial inositol phosphate production upon receptor activation with carbachol and the resulting calcium signals were not affected by pertussis toxin-pretreatment of salt gland cells, we conclude that muscarinic receptors are coupled to phospholipase C by a Gq-type G protein.
1045	8487381	Serum enzymes as indicators of capture myopathy in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Dabbert CB, Powell KC	J Wildl Dis	 1993 Apr;29(2):304-9	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-292304	Serum concentrations of the enzymes creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured in captive and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) as indicators of muscle damage. Baseline values for both enzymes were determined from six captive male mallards. During winter 1990 to 1991, six diets (including controls) representative of food available in the Mississippi alluvial valley were fed to captive female mallards housed in an outdoor aviary at the White River National Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas County, Arkansas (USA). Controlled handling of penned mallards resulted in elevated serum CK (means = 1,352 IU/liter; SD = 1,212) and AST (means = 101 IU/liter; SD = 95) concentrations consistent with myopathies. These serum enzyme elevations were not affected (P > 0.3) by dietary selenium concentrations in the six diets or by energy malnutrition suffered by birds fed soybeans. Capture of wild mallards with an entanglement type rocket net resulted in serum CK and AST concentrations (means = 12,035 and 330 IU/liter; SD = 8,125 and 171, respectively) that were higher (P < 0.001) than those reported after capture with an enveloping type rocket net. Baseline values, controlled handling values, and entanglement rocket net values for serum CK and AST all differed (P < 0.0001).
1046	8489048	The innervation of the syrinx of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos)	Scala G, Corona M, Pelagalli GV, de Girolamo P	Anat Histol Embryol	 1993 Mar;22(1):59-66	 doi: 101111/j1439-02641993tb00342x	The innervation of the Syrinx was studied in 15 female Peking Ducks of 10 to 12 months old by using L.M. and E.M. In this organ a nervous plexiform net is present located in the connective below the epithelium along the membrana tympaniformis medialis. This net-work is made of the nervous trunks which repeatedly anastomise among themselves and display during their course acapsulate ganglions. However, no specialized contact device were encountered at the periphery.
1047	15091819	Reproduction of mallards following overwinter exposure to selenium.	Heinz GH, Fitzgerald MA	Environ Pollut	 1993;81(2):117-22	 doi: 101016/0269-7491(93)90075-y	Forty pairs of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed 15 ppm selenium as selenomethionine for about 21 weeks during winter. Twenty pairs served as controls. At the end of 21 weeks, which coincided with the onset of the reproductive season, selenium treatment was ended. Four birds died while on selenium treatment. Treated females lost weight, and their egg-laying was delayed. Hatching success of some of the first eggs laid by selenium-treated females was lower than that of controls, and a few of these early eggs contained deformed embryos, but, after a period of about two weeks off the selenium-treated diet, reproductive success returned to a level comparable with that of controls. The return to normal reproductive success was the result of a corresponding decrease in selenium concentrations in eggs once selenium treatment ended.
1048	8404053	Recombination nodules and axial equalization in the ZW pairs of the Peking duck and the guinea fowl.	Solari AJ, Pigozzi MI	Cytogenet Cell Genet	 1993;64(3-4):268-72	 doi: 101159/000133591	The meiotic Z and W chromosomes of the Guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and the Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) show features similar to those described previously for 3 species of Phasianidae: chicken, Japanese quail and bobwhite quail. Axial equalization in the gonosomes of the Peking duck involves lengthening of the W axis along with shortening of the Z axis. A single recombination nodule is constantly found in the synaptic, terminal region of the ZW pairs stained with phosphotungstic acid. The localization of this nodule is significantly different in these two species, but the length of synaptonemal complex harboring the nodules is not significantly different. Based on the phylogenetic distance between the observed species, the present data support the hypothesis that the presence of a pseudoautosomal region is a general property of ZW pairs in carinate birds.
1049	18670984	Incidence of Toxoplasma gondii in populations of wild birds in the Czech Republic.	Uterak I, Hejlicek K, Nezval J, Folk C	Avian Pathol	 1992 Dec;21(4):659-65	 doi: 101080/03079459208418887	The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii was isolated from 193 individuals of 25 wild avian species, in a survey between 1981 and 90 in which 5880 individuals, comprising 76 species, were examined. The incidence of T. gondii was 18% in rooks (Corvus frugilegus), 12% in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), 8% in common buzzards (Buteo buteo), 2% in pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and 0.5% in house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and differed significantly in these species (X(2) test, P<0.001). In rooks, the cysts of T. gondii were found in the heart, brain, sex organs, skeletal muscle and liver.
1050	1494141	Development of brainstem auditory pathway in mallard duck embryos and hatchlings.	Dmitrieva LP, Gottlieb G	J Comp Physiol A	 1992 Dec;171(5):665-71	 doi: 101007/BF00194114	The development of the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) was studied in mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) embryos and hatchlings from 5-6 days before hatching through two days after hatching in response to tone pips of different frequencies. BAEPs showed a different time of onset and a different rate of development for low, middle, and high frequencies. Although auditory sensitivity in the mid-frequency range (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 kHz) appeared 1-2 days later than in the low-frequency range, development of the BAEPs in the mid-frequency range was almost complete by hatching. In contrast, the development of auditory sensitivity in the low- and high-frequency ranges continued to develop after hatching. Accelerated development of BAEPs to middle frequencies during the embryonic period and to high frequencies after hatching was correlated with the ducklings' exposure to their own mid-frequency and high-frequency vocalizations before and after hatching, respectively.
1051	1490583	A comparison of the responses of dispersed steroidogenic cells derived from embryonic adrenal tissue from the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus), the domestic Pekin duck and the wild mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and the domestic muscovy duck (Cairina moschata).	Collie MA, Holmes WN, Cronshaw J	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1992 Dec;88(3):375-87	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(92)90232-9	The steroidogenic responsiveness of adrenal cell suspensions prepared from domestic chicken adrenal tissue at the end of embryogenesis was compared to the responses of similar preparations derived from the wild and domesticated mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and the domesticated muscovy duck (Cairina moschata). In all cases, the masses of corticosterone (B), aldosterone (Aldo), and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) released from cells incubated in medium containing 1-24 ACTH exceeded the estimated hormone content of the freshly dispersed cells; the induced rates of corticosteroid release were, therefore, presumed to reflect de novo hormone synthesis. When chicken cells were incubated in medium containing 1-24 ACTH, there were progressive, dose-dependent increases in B and DOC synthesis over a range of concentrations spanning two orders of magnitude; only small, non-dose-related, albeit significant, increases in Aldo release were observed. The 1-24 ACTH-induced increases in B and Aldo synthesis by the mallard and Pekin duck cells exposed to the same range of concentrations were up to 40 and 60 times greater than the corresponding responses of the chicken cells. The rates of 1-24 ACTH-induced B and DOC release from muscovy duck cells were similar to those from the Pekin duck cells; compared with the mallard duck cells, however, the muscovy duck cells were less sensitive and the maximum inducible rate of B release was significantly lower. The pattern of 1-24 ACTH-induced Aldo release from the muscovy duck cells was indistinguishable from that of the mallard duck cells, although the maximum inducible increase occurred at a lower concentration. Angiotensin II (AII) induced very small, but significant increased in B, Aldo, and DOC release from the chicken cells but in a nondose-related fashion. In contrast, mallard, Pekin, and muscovy duck cells all responded in a dose-dependent manner when incubated in medium containing AII. In each instance the maximum rate of Aldo synthesis induced by AII was about one-tenth of the corresponding rate induced by 1-24 ACTH. The maximum rates of B synthesis induced by AII, however, were extremely low compared with the rates induced by 1-24 ACTH. Thus, when maximally stimulated with AII the B:Aldo output ratio ranged from 1.0 to 1.9, whereas the corresponding ratio was between 9.0 and 17.0 when the cells were maximally stimulated with 1-24 ACTH.
1052	29865604	Cruciate ligaments of the avian knee: Insight into a complex system.	Fuss FK, Gasser CR	J Morphol	 1992 Nov;214(2):139-151	 doi: 101002/jmor1052140204	The avian cruciate ligaments were examined in Gallus domesticus, Anas platyrhynchos, Meleagris gallopavo, and Struthio camelus australis. The ligaments proved to be deviated around the intercondylar groove (cranial cruciate) and around the medial femoral condyle (caudal cruciate). Four functionally different fiber groups could be differentiated: fibers taut only in maximal extension, fibers taut only in maximal flexion, fibers taut in ranges from an intermediate position to an extreme position, and fibers taut throughout the entire range of motion (guiding bundles). Hence the cruciates serve the guiding of the joint and the restriction of motion, whereby the majority of the cranial cruciate fibers are taut in extension while those of the caudal cruciate are in flexion. No differences were found between the species examined with respect to fiber arrangement and function. The avian mechanical model proved to be more complex than the relatively simple mammalian four-bar link model as the avian guiding bundles change their shape due to deflection during motion.

1053	1492526	Detection of aflatoxin B1 in tissues of free-living game animals (Lepus europaeus, Phasianus colchicus, Capreolus capreolus, Anas platyrhynchos)	Bukovjan K, Hallmannova A, Karpenko A, Prosek J	Zentralbl Veterinarmed B	 1992 Nov;39(9):695-708	 doi: 101111/j1439-04501992tb01224x	This contribution states concentrations of products of toxogenic mould fungus Aspergillus in livers, kidneys and testes of specific game animals. In hares (Lepus europaeus), there was determined an average concentration in livers of 0.407 microgram.kg-1 +/- 0.29, in kidneys 0.658 microgram.kg-1 +/- 0.60, in testes 0.523 microgram.kg-1 +/- 0.27 and in the ovaries 0.207 microgram.kg-1 +/- 0.19. Higher values were found in those animals with silage pits, hayricks and liquid manure pits nearby. In roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), average concentration of Aflatoxin showed the following results:livers--0.696 microgram.kg-1 +/- 0.59, kidneys--0.794 microgram.kg-1 +/- 0.48, testes--0.367 microgram.kg-1 +/- 0.22. The different values found in the organs are likely to be dependent upon the varying resistance of species when digesting, and also upon the wide-spread variance of intaken food. Average concentration of Aflatoxin B1 in pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) were recorded to be in livers 0.329 micrograms.kg-1 +/- 0.38, and in kidneys 0.676 micrograms.kg-1 +/- 0.59. Controlled contents of mycotoxin in livers of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) was found to be 0.840 micrograms.kg-1, in kidneys 0.594 micrograms.kg-1 +/- 0.85. Animals living in ecologically strained localities showed maximum values of 3.605 micrograms.kg-1 in kidneys and 2.484 micrograms.kg-1 in livers. An alimentary and inhalatory path for mycotoxin or for solely mould fungus into the organism could be found in the rearing of chicken. Detection of Aflatoxin B1 was performed by the means of proved radioimmunological screening method (33) that had been accompanied by routine chromatographic methods.
1054	1455688	Duck lymphocytes. VI. Requirement for phagocytic and adherent cells in lymphocyte transformation.	Higgins DA	Vet Immunol Immunopathol	 1992 Nov;34(3-4):367-77	 doi: 101016/0165-2427(92)90176-q	Preparations of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) spleen and blood lymphocytes depleted of cells capable of phagocytosing carbonyl iron gave lower transformation responses to the mitogens phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), Bandeiraea simplicifolia seed lectin (BSS), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), lentil lectin (LL) and phorbol ester (PMA) than intact cell preparations. When cell populations were fractionated on the basis of their adherence to plastic, it was found that the adherent cells were responsive to PHA, Con A, BSS, WGA and PMA, while the non-adherent cells responded to LL. These observations confirm the expected requirement for phagocytic accessory cells in the induction of in vitro mitogen-driven duck lymphocyte responses. The responses of plastic-adherent populations of cells to most mitogens are believed to reflect the generally close physical relationship between the adherent accessory cells and the lymphocytes, although it remains possible that duck monocytes respond to some of the mitogens employed. The data also suggest that LL stimulates a population of cells different to those responding to other mitogens.
1055	1401901	Structural relationship between the two IgY of the duck, Anas platyrhynchos: molecular genetic evidence.	Magor KE, Warr GW, Middleton D, Wilson MR, Higgins DA	J Immunol	 1992 Oct 15;149(8):2627-33		cDNA clones encoding the H chains of the 7.8S and 5.7S IgY of the White Pekin duck have been isolated and sequenced. The H chain of the 7.8S IgY possesses four C region domains and thus resembles the H chain of chicken IgY with which it shows, in the C region, 54% inferred amino acid sequence identity, and complete conservation of the C region cysteine and tryptophan residues. The H chain of the 5.7S IgY possesses only two C region domains, that are virtually identical to CH1 and CH2 of the 7.8S IgY H chain. Although Southern blot genomic analysis did not resolve whether the two transcripts encoding the H chains of the 7.8S and 5.7S IgY are derived from one or two H chain-encoding genes, the CH 1, 2, 3, and 4 exons are apparently colinear, and no evidence was found for a separate locus in which CH1 and 2 exons were present and CH3 and 4 exons were lacking. The VH domain-encoding sequences of the cDNA for the two IgY H chains showed high similarity in the inferred VH gene (93% nucleotide and 91% inferred amino acid identity) and in the inferred JH segment (89% nucleotide and 93% inferred amino acid identity) but low similarity in the D region (26% nucleotide and 7% inferred amino acid identity). Genomic Southern blot hybridization analysis showed multiple VH-hybridizing sequences represented on up to 20 restriction fragments.
1056	1485860	Sarcocystis in mallards on the Southern High Plains of Texas.	Fedynich AM, Pence DB	Avian Dis	 1992 Oct-Dec;36(4):1067-9		Two hundred thirty-one mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) collected during 1989-91 on the Southern High Plains of Texas were examined for macroscopically detectable Sarcocystis spp. Only eight adult mallards were infected. Based on small quantified tissue samples, five, one, and two birds had light, medium, and heavy infections, respectively. Prevalences were 4%, 8%, 9%, and 0% across two consecutive summer and winter periods, respectively. A new locality record for Sarcocystis spp. was established in both migratory and breeding populations of mallards. Our data suggest that geographic regions other than the Southern High Plains are more important in the transmission of Sarcocystis spp. in mallards.
1057	1415660	Baroreflex control of arterial blood pressure during involuntary diving in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var.).	Smith FM, Jones DR	Am J Physiol	 1992 Sep;263(3 Pt 2):R693-702	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19922633R693	The dynamic role of arterial baroreceptors in control of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), hindlimb vascular (HLVR) and total peripheral (TPR) resistance responses to forced dives was investigated in acutely and chronically barodenervated ducks. To activate the baroreflex, the proximal end of one aortic nerve was stimulated electrically with bipolar electrodes that had been implanted under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia. Predive nerve stimulation caused CO to fall (by reducing HR; stroke volume remained constant), producing a decrease in MAP to half the prestimulation level. During diving (for 2.5-min periods) nerve stimulation did not affect HR and MAP after the first minute of submersion. Neither HLVR nor TPR contributed to the fall in MAP during aortic nerve stimulation before or during diving. The effects of nerve stimulation on HR and MAP were maintained to the end of dives in animals given 100% O2 to breathe before diving. In separate experiments, increasing arterial chemoreceptor input by perfusing one vascularly isolated carotid body with venous blood caused a reduction in the effects of aortic nerve stimulation on MAP. Arterial baroreceptors may thus act on HR to alter MAP early in the dive, but as the dive progresses the baroreflex is attenuated by an increase in peripheral chemoreceptor drive.
1058	1514839	Interactive effects of selenium, methionine, and dietary protein on survival, growth, and physiology in mallard ducklings.	Hoffman DJ, Sanderson CJ, LeCaptain LJ, Cromartie E, Pendleton GW	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1992 Aug;23(2):163-71	 doi: 101007/BF00212270	Concentrations of over 100 ppm (100 mg/kg) selenium (Se) have been found in aquatic food chains associated with irrigation drainwater. Both quantity and composition of dietary protein for wild ducklings may vary in selenium-contaminated environments. Day-old mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings received one of the following diets containing 22% protein: unsupplemented (controls), 15 ppm Se (as selenomethionine), 60 ppm Se, methionine supplemented, 15 ppm Se with methionine supplement, or 60 ppm Se with methionine supplement. In a second concurrent experiment the above sequence was repeated with a protein-restricted (11%) but isocaloric diet. In a third concurrent experiment all ducklings received 44% protein with 0, 15, or 60 ppm Se added. After 4 weeks, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical and histological examination. With 22% protein and 60 ppm Se in the diet, duckling survival and growth was reduced and histopathological lesions of the liver occurred. Antagonistic interactive effects occurred between supplementary methionine and Se, including complete to partial alleviation of the following Se effects by methionine: mortality, hepatic lesions, and altered glutathione and thiol status. With 11% protein, growth of controls was less than that with 22% protein, Se (60 ppm) caused 100% mortality, and methionine supplementation, although protective afforded less protection than it did with 22% protein. With 44% protein, ducklings experienced physiological stress, and Se was more toxic than with methionine-supplemented 22% protein. These findings suggest the potential for antagonistic effects of Se, methionine, and protein on duckling survival and physiology.
1059	24234343	Organochlorine residues in New York waterfowl harvested by hunters in 1983-1984.	Foley RE	Environ Monit Assess	 1992 Apr;21(1):37-48	 doi: 101007/BF00400056	Thirteen organochlorine compounds were detected in fat and breast muscle tissues of Canada goose and five species of ducks that were shot by sportsman in New York. Residues of DDE and PCB occurred most frequently and were positively identified along with DDT, heptachlor epoxide, trans-nonachlor, and hexachlorobenzene. Compounds that were detected but not positively confirmed by mass spectrometry were dieldrin, mirex, heptachlor, chlordane, oxychlordane, and endrin. Wood duck (Aix sponsa) and Canada goose (Branta canadensis) had significantly lower levels of DDE and PCB than black duck (Anas rubripes), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), scaup (Athya sp.), and bufflehead (Bucephala albeola). Birds collected from Long Island and the Hudson River-Lake Champlain corridor carried highest concentrations.
1060	1602572	Starvation, staphylococcosis, and vitamin A deficiency among mallards overwintering in Saskatchewan.	Wobeser G, Kost W	J Wildl Dis	 1992 Apr;28(2):215-22	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-282215	During January to March 1991, 38 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) found dead from a group of approximately 600 overwintering on the South Saskatchewan River were examined. Thirty birds died from starvation, four had disseminated Staphylococcus aureus infection, and the cause of death of four birds was not determined. All six birds from which the esophagus was examined microscopically, including the four birds with staphylococcosis, had squamous metaplasia of the submucosal glands, a lesion pathognomonic for vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency may occur in mallards and other waterfowl that overwinter north of traditional wintering areas and rely on grains deficient in carotenoids.
1061	1313230	Calcium-sensitivity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate metabolism in exocrine cells from the avian salt gland.	Hildebrandt JP, Shuttleworth TJ	Biochem J	 1992 Mar 15;282 ( Pt 3):703-10	 doi: 101042/bj2820703	The generation of inositol phosphates upon muscarinic-receptor activation was studied in [3H]inositol-loaded exocrine cells from the nasal salt glands of the duck Anas platyrhynchos, and the metabolism of different inositol phosphates in vitro was studied in tissue homogenates, with particular reference to the possible interaction of changes in intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) with the metabolic processes. In intact cells, there was a rapid (within 15 s) generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, followed by an accumulation of their breakdown products, Ins(1,3,4)P3 and inositol bis- and monophosphates. Ca(2+)-sensitivity of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was demonstrated in tissue homogenates, with the rate of phosphorylation increasing 2-fold at free Ca2+ concentrations greater than 1 microM. However, addition of calmodulin or the presence of the calmodulin inhibitor W-7 (up to 100 microM) had no effect. 3-Kinase activity increased proportionally with the initial Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration up to 1 microM, but a 10-fold higher substrate concentration produced only a doubling in the phosphorylation rate. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was dephosphorylated to Ins(1,3,4)P3, which accumulated in the homogenate assays as well as in intact cells. Depending on its concentration, Ins(1,3,4)P3 was phosphorylated [in part to Ins(1,3,4,6)P4] or dephosphorylated. To investigate the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of the 3-kinase in intact cells, excess quin2 was used to buffer the receptor-mediated transient changes in [Ca2+]i in [3H]inositol-loaded cells. These experiments revealed that increasing [Ca2+]i from less than 100 to approx. 400 nM (i.e. within the physiological range) has no effect on the partitioning of Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolism (phosphorylation versus dephosphorylation) and on the accumulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. This indicates that activation of the 3-kinase by physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations may not play a major role in the generation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 signals upon receptor activation in these cells. The latter are mainly achieved by the receptor-mediated increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the cell and its phosphorylation by the 3-kinase in a substrate-concentration-dependent manner.
1062	1554253	Interactive effects of arsenate, selenium, and dietary protein on survival, growth, and physiology in mallard ducklings.	Hoffman DJ, Sanderson CJ, LeCaptain LJ, Cromartie E, Pendleton GW	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1992 Jan;22(1):55-62	 doi: 101007/BF00213302	High concentrations of arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) have been found in aquatic food chains associated with irrigation drainwater. Total biomass of invertebrates, a major source of protein for wild ducklings, may vary in environments that are contaminated with selenium. Day-old mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings received an untreated diet (controls) containing 22% protein or diets containing 15 ppm Se (as selenomethionine), 60 ppm Se, 200 ppm As (as sodium arsenate), 15 ppm Se with 200 ppm As, or 60 ppm Se with 200 ppm As. In a concurrent experiment, the same sequence was repeated with a protein-restricted (7%) but isocaloric diet. After 4 weeks, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical and histological examination. With 22% protein and 60 ppm Se in the diet, duckling survival and growth was reduced and livers had histopathological lesions. Arsenic alone caused some reduction in growth. Antagonistic interactive effects occurred between As and Se, including complete to partial alleviation of the following Se effects: mortality, impaired growth, hepatic lesions and lipid peroxidation, and altered glutathione and thiol status. With 7% protein, survival and growth of controls was less than that with 22% protein, Se (60 ppm) caused 100% mortality, and As (200 ppm) caused mortality, decreased growth, and liver histopathology. These findings suggest the potential for antagonistic effects of Se and As on duckling survival, growth, and physiology with adequate dietary protein but more severe toxicological effects when dietary protein is diminished.
1063	1295558	Geometrical differences between neck motoneurons located in the brainstem and spinal cord in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos L.; a Golgi study.	Zijlstra C, Dubbeldam JL	Eur J Morphol	 1992;30(3):219-31		The dendrite geometry of neck motoneurons located in the upper cervical cord and lower brainstem of the mallard was studied in Golgi silver impregnated material. Measurements were obtained from camera lucida drawings and concerned the extent and orientation of dendritic trees. Dendrites were found to be oriented predominantly parallel to the sagittal plane, and projections were asymmetric in the dorso-ventral direction. Comparison between motoneurons located in the supraspinal nucleus of the brainstem and motoneurons in the ventral horn of the upper spinal cord showed that dendrites of motoneurons in the first cell group branch more often than those of neurons in the latter group. In addition, dendritic trees of ventral horn motoneurons preferentially project into the field dorsal to the cell body.
1064	1838776	Functional morphological interpretation of the distribution of muscle spindles in the jaw muscles of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Bout RG, Dubbeldam JL	J Morphol	 1991 Dec;210(3):215-26	 doi: 101002/jmor1052100302	The morphology and distribution of muscle spindles of jaw and tongue muscles in the mallard were examined in serial transverse sections of single muscles and in horizontal sections of a whole head. Our observations on spindle morphology are in agreement with previous descriptions of spindles in birds. Some spindles differ in their innervation and the pattern of intrafusal muscle fibers. The spindles of individual adductor and pterygoid muscles are distributed unevenly. Some adductor muscles lack spindles, whereas those of other muscles are confined to limited areas. Jaw opening muscles and extrinsic tongue muscles lack spindles. The stretch of extrafusal muscle fibers could be estimated from the difference in sarcomere length for birds with the beak open and closed. Not all muscle fiber groups are stretched evenly over the whole range of jaw opening. Only those fiber groups that are continuously stretched during jaw opening contain spindles.
1065	1786030	Cranial teratomas in two domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).	Homer BL, Riggs MW	Avian Dis	 1991 Oct-Dec;35(4):994-8		Teratomas are rare tumors in domestic fowl, and none have been reported in the cranial area of ducks. Clinical signs and gross and microscopic findings associated with a cranial teratoma in two domestic ducks are reported. One tumor arose within the cranial vault and was associated with neurologic signs. The other tumor was subcutaneous and invaded the parietal bone but did not extend into the brain. Both tumors were tridermic.

Kasserra CE, Jones DR, Hughes MR	Respir Physiol	 1991 Sep;85(3):383-93	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(91)90076-u	The effects of acute changes in plasma osmolality on blood acid-base status and ventilation were investigated in the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos. Hyperosmolality due to intravenous infusion of hypertonic NaCl or sucrose caused a prolonged acidosis (so-called dilution acidosis), which was attributable to a decrease in estimated strong ion difference due to a fall in the plasma [Na+]:[Cl-] ratio. Ventilation did not increase in response to the acidosis, and was actually depressed in some birds. PaCO2 increased by 3.5 +/- 1.5 Torr and PaO2 decreased by 4 +/- 2 Torr over the 2 h experimental period in all animals. It is suggested that the extracellular acidosis due to hyperosmolality is accompanied by an intracellular alkalosis which may suppress chemoreceptor stimulation, resulting in no ventilatory increase. Hyposmolality had no effect on acid-base status or respiration.
1067	1772445	Avian tandem repeats: nuclear protein binding sites and the origins of short tandem repetitive DNAS.	Zhu XY, Testori A, Oh S, Skinner JD, Burgoyne LA	Biochem Int	 1991 Sep;25(1):191-8		A 14 bp repeat isolated from the genome of a Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and a 13 bp repeat isolated from the genome of a Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) were both tandem and genus-specific. There were 2.1 x 10(6) copies of the 14 bp repeat in the Mallard duck genome and 1.3 x 10(6) copies of the 13 bp repeat in the Muscovy duck genome. These two repeats were not obviously homologous but each contains different transcription protein binding sites. Experimentally, the two repeats were also observed to bind nuclear proteins specifically. A sequence-selective mechanism for the expansion of short tandem repeats from single ancestral sequences containing nuclear protein binding sites is presented.
1068	1872367	Inositol phosphates and Ca2+]i signals in a differentiating exocrine cell.	Hildebrandt JP, Shuttleworth TJ	Am J Physiol	 1991 Aug;261(2 Pt 1):C210-7	 doi: 101152/ajpcell19912612C210	Generation of inositol phosphates and changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) upon muscarinic receptor activation were studied in isolated cells from the nasal salt gland of Anas platyrhynchos, comparing responses in the poorly differentiated cells from ducks drinking only tap water (naive cells) with the more fully differentiated actively secreting cells from ducks drinking 1% NaCl solution for 48 h before the experiment (stressed cells). On stimulation, naive cells showed a rapid five- to sevenfold increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3], accompanied by similar changes in Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, whereas both values increased only twofold in stressed cells. [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding experiments revealed that these differences in inositol phosphate production were correlated with differences in the numbers of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Continuous recordings of [Ca2+]i revealed that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores upon stimulation was similar in both cell types, but the sustained [Ca2+]i signal (dependent on Ca2+ entry) was three times more pronounced in stressed cells. The results suggest that the adaptive differentiation of salt gland cells is associated with the increased expression of the receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry mechanism. In addition, the high rate of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in naive cells upon receptor activation may have a significance in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, which are elements of the development of the salt transport capabilities in these cells.
1069	1921325	A percutaneous liver biopsy technique in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) experimentally infected with duck hepatitis B virus.	Varagona G, Ellis LA, Moore D, Penney D, Dusheiko GM	Lab Anim	 1991 Jul;25(3):254-7	 doi: 101258/002367791780808400	Aylesbury ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) chronically infected with the duck hepatitis B virus provide a useful model for studying hepadna-virus infection, replication and the effects of antiviral therapy. In these studies, it is necessary to have an effective method for obtaining repeat liver specimens for histological and molecular analyses. We have therefore developed a percutaneous liver biopsy technique which has a low rate of complications, can be performed at repeated intervals, and provides sufficient quantities of liver tissue for histological and nucleic acid hybridization analysis.
1070	1920662	Inflammatory cell stimulation and wound healing in Sphaeridiotrema globulus experimentally infected mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Mucha KH, Huffman JE	J Wildl Dis	 1991 Jul;27(3):428-34	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-273428	Thirty laboratory-reared mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were experimentally infected with Sphaeridiotrema globulus. Host cell-mediated immunity and wound healing in S. globulus infected ducks were evaluated by gross and histological examination. Establishment, location, and life span of S. globulus differed from previous reports of sphaeridiotremiasis in both naturally and experimentally infected waterfowl. No worms were recovered from the ceca, and worm migration occurred anterior to the ileo-cecal valve with greater dispersion (less worm crowding) at higher rates of infectivity. Parasite death and host lesion resolution were evident at days 8 to 10 postinfection (PI) in ducks fed a moderate dose (200 metacercariae, group A) with a 5% mean parasite recovery rate. Host death occurred at days 3 to 6 in ducks fed a high dose (550 metacercariae, group B) with a 16% mean parasite recovery rate. Mast cells increased significantly (P less than 0.005) in group A ducks from days 4 to 10 PI. Eosinophil proliferation was greater in group B than in group A on day 4 PI, but comparatively fewer eosinophils were identifiable in group B ducks on day 6 PI.
1071	1889740	The interspersed DNA repeat conserved in water birds' genomes.	Zhu X, Burgoyne LA, Skinner JD	Genome	 1991 Jun;34(3):493-4	 doi: 101139/g91-075	A putative old and ubiquitous interspersed DNA repeat family was identified from TaqI restriction, M13 cloning, and sequencing of the genomic DNA of a Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), a Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata), a Toulouse Goose (Anser anser), and a Black Swan (Cygnus atratus). A 425-bp consensus core sequence was obtained for the interspersed family. The 425-bp unit was about 2% of the avian genome and was found to be conserved in at least four genera of the order Anseriforme: Anas, Anser, Cairina, and Cygnus.
1072	1879657	Steroid hormone binding in the Harderian gland of birds: characteristics of the androgen, estrogen, and progestin receptors of Anas platyrhynchos and Gallus domesticus.	Vilchis F, Chavez B, Perez-Palacios G	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1991 Jun;82(3):425-33	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(91)90317-y	A series of experiments was carried out in immature female chicks and ducks to establish whether the avian Harderian gland contains specific receptors for sex steroids. Cytosol preparations of Harderian glands were submitted to hormone saturation analysis using radiolabeled estradiol, ORG-2058, and dimethylnortestosterone as ligands. In addition, the sedimentation characteristics of the hormone-receptor complexes were studied by ultracentrifugation of linear sucrose gradients. The presence of high affinity binding sites for estrogens (Kd = 2.4 and 1.6 nM), progestins (0.8 and 1.0 nM), and androgens (1.0 and 1.0 nM) was indicated in the chick and duck glands, respectively. The sedimentation coefficients were 7-7.5 S, 7-8 S, and 8 S for estrogen, progestin, and androgen receptor-ligand complexes, respectively. The concentration of the androgen receptor was significantly higher in chick than in duck Harderian glands whereas the estrogen and progestin receptor concentrations were similar in both species. A striking finding was the presence of progestin receptors, which apparently do not exist in the glands of many mammals. Priming with estrogens did not modify the concentration of ORG-2058 binding sites in either species studied, indicating that gland progestin receptor is not estrogen-regulated. Overall the data suggest intracellular mechanisms whereby circulating gonadal hormones regulate avian Harderian gland function.
1073	2067053	Brain acetylcholinesterase activity in botulism-intoxicated mallards.

AChE levels for both groups were within the range reported for normal mallards, and there was no significant difference in mean AChE activity between birds that ingested botulism toxin and died and those that did not.
1074	2016754	Subchronic hepatotoxicity of selenomethionine ingestion in mallard ducks.	Hoffman DJ, Heinz GH, LeCaptain LJ, Bunck CM, Green DE	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1991 Apr;32(4):449-64	 doi: 101080/15287399109531495	Two-year-old male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) received a control diet (0.2 ppm Se) or diets containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 ppm Se as selenomethionine for 14 wk. Se accumulated readily in the liver in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a mean concentration of 29 ppm (wet weight) in the 32 ppm group. Dietary Se of 2 ppm or greater increased plasma glutathione peroxidase activity. Mortality (10%) and histopathological effects, including bile duct hyperplasia and hemosiderin pigmentation of the liver and spleen, occurred in the 32 ppm group. These histopathological effects were accompanied by lower hemoglobin concentrations (16 and 32 ppm groups) and hematocrit (32 ppm group), and elevated plasma alkaline phosphatase activity (32 ppm group) indicative of cholestatic liver injury. Other manifestations of hepatotoxicity included significant linear dose responses for hepatic oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations and ratio of GSSG to reduced glutathione (GSH). Means for both of these responses differed from controls in groups receiving 8-32 ppm Se. Mean hepatic GSH and malondialdehyde (a measure of lipid peroxidation) concentrations were significantly elevated in the 16 and 32 ppm groups. Subchronic effects of selenomethionine, which occurs in vegetation, are of particular interest with respect to the health of wild aquatic birds in seleniferous locations.
1075	1770434	Partial uncoupling of salt gland blood flow and secretion in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Gerstberger R	J Physiol	 1991 Apr;435:175-86	 doi: 101113/jphysiol1991sp018504	1. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the blood flow through and the secretion by the salt glands of conscious, salt-water-adapted Pekin ducks. 2. Intravenous loading with hypertonic saline induced a steady-state secretion from the salt glands with a concomitant increase in whole-organ blood flow. The distribution of elevated local glandular blood flow was, however, uneven and in addition demonstrated vasomotor patterns that ranged from constant to rhythmic. 3. During on-going salt gland secretion, the infusion of three vasoactive agents, 5Val-angiotensin II (ANG II), 8Arg-vasotocin (AVT) and noradrenaline, via the carotid artery had differential effects on salt gland blood flow and secretion. 4. ANG II (80 pmol min-1 (kg body wt)-1) had no effect on mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), produced a transient 30% decrease in glandular blood flow and strongly diminished salt gland secretion (retention of 6.4 mosmol NaCl). 5. AVT (20 pmol min-1 (kg body wt)-1) had no effect on MABP and did not alter salt gland secretion despite a 35% reduction in blood flow. 6. Noradrenaline (20 nmol min-1 (kg body wt)-1) elevated MABP by 15 mmHg, reduced salt gland blood flow by more than 50%, but diminished salt gland secretion only slightly (retention of 2.7 mosmol NaCl). 7. Using ANG II, AVT and noradrenaline as hormonal tools, integrated changes in blood flow rate did not correspond with integrated changes in salt gland excretion. The partial dissociation between both parameters shows that control of secretion by the salt gland is more complex than simply being linearly dependent upon blood flow through it.
1076	29865521	Configuration of the medial and lateral segments of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) salt glands.	Butler DG, Youson JH, Campolin E	J Morphol	 1991 Feb;207(2):201-210	 doi: 101002/jmor1052070211	Salt glands of the domestic duck Anas platyrhynchos differ from those of the herring gull Larus argentatus and other birds. In ducks, each salt gland consists of distinct medial and lateral segments. Centrally located drainage ducts that extend along the entire length of these medial and lateral segments collect hypertonic fluid secreted by an array of lobules. Each lobule is formed by a single mass of branched tubules in which the direction of capillary blood flow is opposite to that of the secreted fluid. This fluid drains from the medial segment through an external duct that opens into the nasal cavity at the base of the vestibular fold. A duct from the lateral segment loops and opens onto the surface of the nasal septum. The structure and function of the secretory cells is reviewed briefly within the context of our study of the configuration of duck nasal salt glands.
1077	2015005	Interactive effects of boron, selenium, and dietary protein on survival, growth, and physiology in mallard ducklings.	Hoffman DJ, Sanderson CJ, LeCaptain LJ, Cromartie E, Pendleton GW	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1991 Feb;20(2):288-94	 doi: 101007/BF01055918	High concentrations of boron (B) and selenium (Se) have been found in aquatic food chains associated with irrigation drainwater. Total biomass of invertebrates, a major source of protein for wild ducklings, is sometimes diminished in agricultural drainwater ponds contaminated with Se and B. Day-old mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings received an untreated diet (controls) containing 22% protein or diets containing 15 ppm (microgram/g) Se (as selenomethionine), 60 ppm Se, 1,000 ppm B (as boric acid), 15 ppm Se with 1,000 ppm B, or 60 ppm Se with 1,000 ppm B. In a concurrent experiment, the above sequence was repeated with a protein-restricted (7%) but isocaloric diet. After four weeks, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical and histological examination. With 22% protein and 60 ppm Se in the diet, duckling survival and growth was reduced and histopathological lesions of the liver occurred. Boron alone caused some reduction in growth. Several interactive effects occurred between B and Se, including further reduction in growth, and increases in plasma glutathione reductase activity, hematocrit, hemoglobin and plasma protein concentrations. With 7% protein, the growth of controls was less than that with 22% protein, 60 ppm Se caused 100% mortality, and growth effects of 15 ppm Se and 1,000 ppm B alone were more pronounced than with 22% protein. Selenium accumulation increased in the liver with 7% protein. Interactive effects were greater for Se and B with 7% protein than with 22% protein and included significant mortality and enhanced accumulation of Se in the liver. These findings suggest the potential for more severe toxicological effects of Se and B independently and interactively on duckling survival and development when dietary protein is diminished.
1078	1850807	Cutaneous herpesvirus infection in a mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wojcinski ZW, Wojcinski HS, Barker IK, King NW Jr	J Wildl Dis	 1991 Jan;27(1):129-34	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-271129	Investigations of mortalities involving wild mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) revealed the presence of a herpesvirus associated with skin lesions on the plantar surface of the foot web of one duck. Ultrastructurally, the paracrystalline arrays of viral core particles and unencapsidated nucleoids in the nucleus, and the enveloped viruses in cytoplasmic vacuoles are compatible with a herpesvirus. This appears to be the first report of cutaneous lesions in a mallard duck attributable to a herpesvirus. Whether this lesion is due to duck virus enteritis (DVE), suggesting that cutaneous shedding is possible, or due to another uncharacterized herpesvirus of ducks is unclear.
1079	2023309	Age-dependent changes in activity of mallard plasma cholinesterases.	Bennett RS, Bennett JK	J Wildl Dis	 1991 Jan;27(1):116-8	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-271116	Plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity was measured repeatedly in 27 mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings between 7 and 85 days of age to determine age-dependent changes in enzyme activity. Plasma AChE, BChE, and total cholinesterase (ChE) activity decreased significantly with age. The relative proportion of AChE in total ChE activity also decreased slightly with age. Since some anti-ChE chemicals can selectively inhibit AChE or BChE activity, characterization of age-dependent changes in the activity of each enzyme may be necessary to accurately identify the occurrence of pesticide exposure.
1080	2023304	Effects of lead shot ingestion on selected cells of the mallard immune system.	Rocke TE, Samuel MD	J Wildl Dis	 1991 Jan;27(1):1-9	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-2711	The immunologic effects of lead were measured in game-farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) that ingested lead shot while foraging naturally, mallards intubated with lead shot, and unexposed controls. Circulating white blood cells (WBC) declined significantly in male mallards exposed to lead by either natural ingestion or intubation, but not females. Spleen plaque-forming cell (SPFC) counts were significantly lower in mallards intubated with lead pellets compared to controls. Declines in WBC and SPFC means with increasing tissue lead concentrations provide further evidence that lead exposure reduced immunologic cell numbers. Hormonal activity and diet may have influenced the immunologic effects of lead exposure in this study.
1081	1989497	Developmental changes in the expression of S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase gene and lipid composition in the uropygial gland of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Kolattukudy PE, Bohnet S, Sasaki G, Rogers L	Arch Biochem Biophys	 1991 Jan;284(1):201-6	 doi: 101016/0003-9861(91)90284-p	Developmental changes in the composition of the uropygial gland secretory lipids of the postembryonic mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were determined. During the first 3 weeks after hatching, the composition of the secretory lipids remained constant; the lipids consisted of long-chain wax esters composed of a complex mixture of n-, monomethyl, and dimethyl fatty acids esterified to n-C16 and n-C18 fatty alcohols. Afterward, as the ducks began to acquire adult feathers, short-chain wax esters composed of 2- and 4-monomethyl fatty acids began to appear with 2-methylhexanoyl and 4-methylhexanoyl as the major acyl components; esters of short-chain monomethyl fatty acids (less than or equal to C12) constituted 90% of the lipids when the ducks were 2 months old and had acquired adult plumage. The appearance of the short-chain acids in the acyl portion of the wax esters was accompanied by the appearance of S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase, which can hydrolytically release short-chain acids from fatty acid synthase in the gland. Northern blot analysis showed that the gland-specific thioesterase gene transcripts began to appear in the gland only 3 weeks after hatching. The appearance of the transcripts and immunologically detectable thioesterase protein reached maximum levels 2 months after hatching, with the acquisition of the adult plumage. Thus, the developmental changes in lipid composition correlated with the changes in the level of expression of the thioesterase gene. Expression of other gland-specific genes has been previously found to begin just prior to hatching. The gland-specific thioesterase is the first case of delayed expression of a gland-specific gene.
1082	1781603	Gasometric determination of carbon dioxide in carbano-apatites of calcified tissue	Chaigneau M	Ann Pharm Fr	 1991;49(4):209-13		The determination of carbon dioxide in carbonato-apatites is carried out a new gasometric method. Its application, in this paper, concerns the bones of skull and mandibles of Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) and Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). The results lead to appreciable differences between some organs of this two species.
1083	1773860	Duck lymphocytes. IV. Collective effects of mitogens.	Higgins DA	Dev Comp Immunol	 1991 Fall;15(4):357-68	 doi: 101016/0145-305x(91)90028-w	Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) blood lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), lentil lectin (LL), Roman snail lectin (HP), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Bandeiraea simplicifolia seed lectin (BSS), peanut agglutinin (PNA), horseshoe crab lectin (HSC) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mitogens were used individually, in pairs, and in multiple combinations. Some pairs resulted in synergism; transformation, assessed by uptake of [3H]thymidine, was much greater than a direct addition of the effects of the two mitogens used separately. Best results were obtained when PHA or LL were paired with a second mitogen. In general, combinations of lectins at slightly suboptimal concentrations gave highest transformation, and all strongly synergistic combinations elicited a similar pattern of dose response through different concentrations of PHA. If a third mitogen was included, some combinations gave some further synergism, in other combinations the synergism of two mitogens was reduced by including a third, and if a pair of mitogens did not demonstrate synergism then none was generated when a third mitogen was included. Inclusion of more mitogens to successfully synergistic trios reduced transformation. The system could provide a useful model for in vitro enhancement of responses among lymphocytes from a species with a weak immune system.
1084	1752216	Neuronal lysosome accumulation in degrading synapses of sensory-motor and limbic subsystems in the duck Anas platyrhynchos: indication of rearrangements during avian brain development-	Teuchert-Noodt G, Breuker KH, Dawirs RR	Dev Neurosci	 1991;13(3):151-63	 doi: 101159/000112153	Brains of developing duck embryos and ducklings were analysed daily by light microscopy after complete serial brain sectioning and lysosome staining (Gallyas technique), providing insight into synaptic degradation and degeneration during short periods of synaptogenesis. Both regional and temporal shifting pattern of lysosome accumulation (LA) in degraded synapses were detected in sensory-motor pathways during the course of development. LA occurred in sensory projections of embryos, and proceeded from forebrain sensory fields toward limbic regions and finally motor projections. LA disappeared from these structures at the age of 4-6 weeks. LA was analysed ultrastructurally in selected sensory, limbic and motor regions indicating that lysosomes selectively accumulated in transient synapses, leaving parts of either pre- or postsynaptic elements untouched. In no case did denervated neurons exhibit any signs of cell death. Apparently, the LA phenomenon seems critical in terms of both irreversible elimination and remodelling of persisting synapses. Thus, neuronal rearrangement mediated by lysosomal degradation, i.e. degeneration of synaptic components, is supposed to be an integral constituent of synaptogenesis during adaptive processes in sensory-motor systems. These results are discussed with regard to developing brain functions during behavioural adaptation of this precocious bird.
1085	2269436	Gene conversion and splice-site slippage in the argininosuccinate lyases/delta-crystallins of the duck lens: members of an enzyme superfamily.	Wistow GJ, Piatigorsky J	Gene	 1990 Dec 15;96(2):263-70	 doi: 101016/0378-1119(90)90262-p	Argininosuccinate lyase(ASL)/delta-crystallin is a prominent example of an enzyme-crystallin with roles as both a catalyst and a major structural component of the eye lens in birds and reptiles. In chicken it appears that gene duplication and separation of function may have occurred with one gene product acting primarily as a crystallin and one primarily as an enzyme. However, two delta-crystallin-encoding genes are abundantly expressed in the lens of the embryonic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) which has extremely high ASL activity. Here the isolation and sequence analysis of full length cDNA clones for both duck delta-crystallins are described. The two delta-crystallins are highly similar (94% identical in predicted aa sequence), probably as a result of gene conversion. However, the cDNA for duck delta 2-crystallin contains an in-frame insertion of two codons, probably the result of a recent intron boundary slippage. ASL/delta-crystallin belongs to a superfamily of lyases, including fumarases, aspartases and adenylosuccinate lyase which possess some highly conserved blocks of aa sequence. There may be some clues to the tertiary structures of these conserved motifs in otherwise unrelated proteins for which three-dimensional structures are known.
1086	2280898	The identification of the motor nuclei innervating the tongue muscles in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); an HRP study.	Dubbeldam JL, Bout RG	Neurosci Lett	 1990 Nov 13;119(2):223-7	 doi: 101016/0304-3940(90)90839-2	Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry was used to identify the motoneurons innervating the tongue muscles in the mallard. Four nuclei are involved: the intermediate motor nucleus of N.VII innervating the stylohyoid, serpihyoid and ceratohyoid muscles, the retrofacial nucleus of N.IX innervating the m. geniohyoideus and the n. intermedius or motor nucleus of N.XII that innervates the mm. ceratoglossus and hyoglossus anterior and obliquus. The m. intermandibularis is innervated by a trigeminal motor subnucleus. There is no clear intranuclear organization. The results are summarized in Table I and discussed in connection with the role of each of the muscles during movements of the tongue.
1087	2169398	Atrial natriuretic factor controls salt gland secretion in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) through interaction with high affinity receptors.	Schutz H, Gerstberger R	Endocrinology	 1990 Oct;127(4):1718-26	 doi: 101210/endo-127-4-1718	Marine birds possess supraorbital salt-secreting glands in addition to the kidneys as osmoregulatory organs to excrete a strongly hypertonic salt solution of mainly NaCl. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-like peptides could be demonstrated immunocytochemically in duck atria, but not in the salt glands. To elucidate the putative role of bird-specific ANF (cANF) in the control of salt gland function, conscious saltwater-acclimated Pekin ducks received 15 pmol/min.kg BW cANF for 10 min at two states of salt gland activity. During steady state diuresis and salt gland secretion induced by systemic infusion of 1.0 ml/min isotonic Krebs-Ringer solution, cANF applied iv enhanced the secretion rate from 0.20 to 0.29 ml/min and the osmolality of secretion from 870 to 920 mosmol/kg. At threshold conditions of salt gland activity, cANF infused intracarotideally stimulated the secretion rate from 0.07 to 0.15 ml/min at elevated osmolality of 760 compared to 480 mosmol/kg. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate remained unchanged. Receptor autoradiography with [125I]Bolton-Hunter-cANF as ligand demonstrated specific binding sites throughout the salt gland tissue of both freshwater and saltwater ducks. Scatchard analysis using an enriched membrane fraction revealed high affinity (Kd = 0.9 nM) binding sites of 270 fmol/mg protein density. Displacement studies with unlabeled cANF and human ANF showed comparable Ki values for both peptides in freshwater and saltwater ducks. The combined results indicate an important role for cANF in the control of avian salt gland function.
1088	2380872	Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) experimentally infected with Echinostoma trivolvis (Digenea).	Mucha KH, Huffman JE, Fried B	J Parasitol	 1990 Aug;76(4):590-2		Of 8, day-old mallard ducklings, each fed 50 encysted metacercariae of Echinostoma trivolvis, 4 (50%) were infected 15-31 days postinfection (PI) with a total of 10 (2.5%) worms. The worms were attached loosely to the mucosa of the lower ileum and rectum-cloaca, and some were ovigerous by day 15 PI. Ducklings, 4-14 days old when fed encysted metacercariae, became infected with E. trivolvis adults, but ducks 150 days old were refractory to infection. Compared to our previous studies on experimental infections of echinostomes, mallard ducklings were less susceptible than golden hamsters to E. trivolvis.

McCarthy AM	Parasitology	 1990 Aug;101 Pt 1:35-42	 doi: 101017/s0031182000079725	Evidence for the existence of 2 first intermediate host-specific sibling species of the 45 collar-spined echinostome Echinoparyphium recurvatum is presented. Experimental studies on their life-cycles were carried out under controlled laboratory conditions. The two entities were found to be morphologically indistinguishable in all major respects, yet they exhibited distinct biological characteristics. One of the sibling species utilizes the freshwater lymnaeid pulmonate snail Lymnaea peregra as first intermediate host, and the adults occur in the anterior small intestine of the wildfowl experimental definitive host Anas platyrhynchos. The other utilizes the freshwater mesogastropod prosobranch snail Valvata piscinalis as first intermediate host, and the adults occur in the posterior small intestine and rectum of A. platyrhynchos. The existence of the two sibling species in sympatry may be explained by the fact that the life-cycles of the two forms represent two distinct cycles of transmission serving to reduce excessive competition between them.

The observed mtDNA clones grouped into two phylogenetically distinct arrays that we estimate differ by about 0.8% in nucleotide sequence. Genotypes in one clonal array were present in both species, while genotypes in the other array were seen only in Mallards. In terms of the mtDNA "gene tree," the assayed Mallards exhibit a paraphyletic relationship with respect to Black Ducks, meaning that genealogical separations among some extant haplotypes in the Mallard predate the species separation. Evidence is advanced that this pattern probably resulted from demographically based processes of lineage sorting, rather than recent, secondary introgressive hybridization. However, haplotype frequencies were most similar among conspecific populations, so the Mallard and Black Ducks cluster separately in terms of a population phenogram. The results provide a clear example of the distinction between a gene tree and a population tree, and of the distinction between data analyses that view individuals versus populations as operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Overall, the mtDNA data indicate an extremely close evolutionary relationship between Mallards and Black Ducks, and in conjunction with the geographic distributions suggest that the Black Duck is a recent evolutionary derivative of a more broadly distributed Mallard-Black ancestor.
1091	2388354	Effects of ingested lead on antibody production in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Trust KA, Miller MW, Ringelman JK, Orme IM	J Wildl Dis	 1990 Jul;26(3):316-22	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-263316	We examined the effects of lead ingestion on in vitro and in vivo indices of immune function in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Twenty-four mallard drakes were randomly divided into three groups (I, II, III), then assigned to treatment or control subgroups (n = 4). On day 0, all treatment birds were dosed orally with one number 4 lead shot (mean = 0.2 g). We challenged all individuals in each group with washed sheep red blood cells (SRBC) injected intraperitoneally on days 0 (Group I), 7 (Group II) or 14 (Group III), and collected blood for analyses 7 and 8 days after SRBC challenge. We measured and compared blood lead concentrations, in vitro lymphocyte transformation responses to phytohemagglutinin A and lipopolysaccharide, and hemagglutination titers to SRBC. Mean blood lead concentrations were elevated (P less than or equal to 0.04) in treatment birds at each sampling period. Large individual variability in lymphocyte stimulation responses precluded further analysis of those data. Hemagglutination titers to SRBC were lower (P less than 0.0001) in lead-poisoned ducks than in controls, suggesting that ingested lead may have immunosuppressive effects on mallards.
1092	2388353	Immune response of mallard ducks treated with immunosuppressive agents: antibody response to erythrocytes and in vivo response to phytohemagglutinin-P.	Schrank CS, Cook ME, Hansen WR	J Wildl Dis	 1990 Jul;26(3):307-15	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-263307	The ability of two in vivo tests to assay immune competence of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) treated with various immunomodulatory agents was examined. Skin responses to phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P) injected intradermally and serum antibody levels produced in response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were measured. As measured by the skin response to PHA-P, ducks injected intramuscularly with cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine did not respond differently from control-injected ducks. Dexamethasone injected intramuscularly significantly suppressed the skin response to PHA-P. As measured by antibody levels in response to SRBC, ducks injected intramuscularly with cyclophosphamide responded with antibody titers similar to controls. Cyclosporine injected intramuscularly reduced the level of immunoglobulin (Ig) G significantly in one of two experiments. Dexamethasone injected intramuscularly reduced peak total and IgG titers. These experiments provide information on the viability of these two in vivo tests to reflect immune competence of mallard ducks.
1093	2167392	Mortality from duck plague virus in immunosuppressed adult mallard ducks.	Goldberg DR, Yuill TM, Burgess EC	J Wildl Dis	 1990 Jul;26(3):299-306	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-263299	Environmental contaminants contain chemicals that, if ingested, could affect the immunological status of wild birds, and in particular, their resistance to infectious disease. Immunosuppression caused by environmental contaminants, could have a major impact on waterfowl populations, resulting in increased susceptibility to contagious disease agents. Duck plague virus has caused repeated outbreaks in waterfowl resulting in mortality. In this study, several doses of cyclophosphamide (CY), a known immunosuppressant, were administered to adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to determine if a resultant decrease in resistance to a normally sub-lethal strain of duck plague virus would occur, and induce mortality in these birds. Death occurred in birds given CY only, and in birds given virus and CY, but not in those given virus only. There was significantly greater mortality and more rapid deaths in the duck plague virus-infected groups than in groups receiving only the immunosuppressant. A positively correlated dose-response effect was observed with CY mortalities, irrespective of virus exposure. A fuel oil and a crude oil, common environmental contaminants with immunosuppressive capabilities, were tested to determine if they could produce an effect similar to that of CY. Following 28 days of oral oil administration, the birds were challenged with a sub-lethal dose of duck plague virus. No alteration in resistance to the virus (as measured by mortality) was observed, except in the positive CY control group.
1094	2364664	Auditory basis of maternal attachment in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) under simulated naturalistic imprinting conditions.	Dyer AB, Gottlieb G	J Comp Psychol	 1990 Jun;104(2):190-4	 doi: 101037/0735-70361042190	The presence of broodmates during the imprinting process results in peer imprinting that interrupts a visually mediated maternal attachment. We sought to determine the conditions in which group-trained mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) acquire a maternal attachment. At 48 hr of age, ducklings were allowed to follow a vocal, stuffed mallard hen individually or in groups of 4. Individual ducklings showed a preference for the silent, familiar mallard over an unfamiliar pintail. Ducklings trained in groups did not show a preference. When the mallard maternal call was present during testing, group-trained ducklings overwhelmingly responded to it regardless of whether it came from the familiar mallard or an unfamiliar pintail. Training ducklings in groups, which simulates the natural social context of imprinting, results in peer imprinting. Thus, early in development the young become visually imprinted to each other, and the maternal call mediates attachment to the mother.
1095	2189020	Microvasculature of the nasal salt gland of the duckling, Anas platyrhynchos: quantitative responses to osmotic adaptation and deadaptation studied with vascular corrosion casting.	Hossler FE, Olson KR	J Exp Zool	 1990 Jun;254(3):237-47	 doi: 101002/jez1402540302	The three-dimensional microvasculature of the nasal salt gland of the duckling was studied by vascular corrosion casting and scanning electron microscopy. Changes in the vascular volume of the gland in response to osmotic stress were also determined using cast weights and densities. The richly vascularized gland is supplied on its medial surface by large branches of the supraorbital and ethmoidal arteries. Numerous arterial branches enter the gland and distribute to lobes via the interlobar connective tissue. Lobar arterioles penetrate to the periductal areas of the lobes before dividing into capillaries supplying the ductal epithelium and secretory tubules. Capillaries envelope the secretory tubules and run radially from the ducts toward the lobe periphery, so that blood flows counter to the tubular secretion. Blood is collected via venous plexuses seen as distinct drainage units on the periphery of each lobe. Veins exhibit large numbers of bicuspid valves. Following 1 day and 4 days of osmotic loading (feeding 1% NaCl), vascular volume of the gland increased fivefold and ninefold, respectively, a response that precedes and exceeds that of the gland weight or Na,K-ATPase activity. When salt water-adapted ducklings were fed fresh water for only 24 hr (deadaptation), vascular volume fell to 2.8 times the control level. Changes in blood flow to the gland during osmotic adaptation and deadaptation are rapid and dramatic and may represent the initial steps in the control of gland secretion.
1096	2353836	Selenium accumulation and elimination in mallards.	Heinz GH, Pendleton GW, Krynitsky AJ, Gold LG	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1990 May-Jun;19(3):374-9	 doi: 101007/BF01054981	Selenium accumulation and loss were measured in adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) fed selenomethionine during two experiments. In Experiment 1, both sexes were fed a diet containing 10 ppm selenium for 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks on untreated feed. Selenium accumulation in liver and muscle of females was described by C = A(1-e-bt). Concentrations of selenium were predicted to reach 95% of equilibrium faster in liver (7.8 days) than in muscle (81 days). The loss of selenium from liver and muscle of females was described by the exponential loss rate equation: C = Ae-bt, with half-times of 18.7 and 30.1 days, respectively. Males reached similar levels of selenium in liver and breast muscle as females and declined to similar levels once selenium treatment ended. In Experiment 2, females were fed increasing levels of selenium until some died. Survivors were switched to an untreated diet and selenium was measured in blood, liver, and breast muscle over 64 days. The same equation as in Experiment 1, C = Ae-bt, was used to describe the loss of selenium from blood and muscle. Half-times were 9.8 and 23.9 days, respectively. For liver, the equation C = A1e-b1t + A2e-b2t was used. Selenium initially decreased in liver by one-half in 3.3 days, with subsequent half-times of 3.9, 6.0, and 45.1 days.
1097	1700518	The genetic variability in the amylase isoenzymes of hybrid muscovy (Cairina moshata) and domestic (Anas platyrhynchos) ducks compared to the initial species	Steklenev EP, Rozhkov IuI	Tsitol Genet	 1990 May-Jun;24(3):56-8		Genetically conditioned polymorphism of alpha-amylases in musk ducks, domestic ones and their hybrids has been described. Two isoenzymes (AMY-1, AMY-2) are in blood serum of the ducks. One of them is apparently formed in crope gland and other--in pancreas. AMY-2 is monomorphic in both species. AMY-2 is polymorphic with three alleles (Amy-1A, Amy-1B, Amy-1B) in musk ducks and monomorphic in domestic ducks (Amy-1C). The hybrids have also allele obtained by them from domestic ducks.
1098	2331033	Effects of acute and chronic baroreceptor denervation on diving responses in ducks.	Smith FM, Jones DR	Am J Physiol	 1990 Apr;258(4 Pt 2):R895-902	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19902584R895	To investigate the effects of barodenervation on the cardiovascular responses to forced submersion, we implanted snares around the aortic nerves innervating the baroreceptors in anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 35-45 mg/kg) ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Snares were withdrawn 1 wk after surgery to effect barodenervation in the absence of complications from surgical trauma or anesthesia. After barodenervation, resting heart rate (HR), hind limb vascular resistance (HLVR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) all increased, with different time courses, over the 16-day observation period. Bradycardia developed during forced submersion in ducks before and after barodenervation, although this response was reduced for 1-3 days after nerve section. The HR response to diving intensified 4-5 days after denervation, and the level of dive bradycardia at 16 days was similar to that before denervation. End-dive MAP fell further, as a proportion of predive MAP, with time after baroreceptor loss. The absolute level of HLVR reached during diving was unaffected by barodenervation. These results show that diving responses develop in the absence of baroreceptors, but MAP in the dive is not maintained as well in barodenervates as in baroreceptor-intact animals.
1099	2134364	Fine structure of the retinal pigment epithelium of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Braekevelt CR	Histol Histopathol	 1990 Apr;5(2):133-8		As part of a comparative morphological study, the fine structure of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the choriocapillaris and Bruch's membrane (complexus basalis) has been investigated by light and electron microscopy in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). In this species the RPE consists of a single layer of cuboidal cells which display numerous very deep basal (scleral) infoldings and extensive apical (vitreal) processes which enclose photoreceptor outer segments. The RPE cells are joined laterally by prominent basally-located tight junctions. Internally smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the most abundant cell organelle with only small amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum present. Polysomes are abundant as are basally-located mitochondria which often displayed a ring-shaped profile. The cell nucleus is large and vesicular. Melanosomes are plentiful only within the apical processes of the RPE cells in the light-adapted state. Myeloid bodies are large and numerous and very often have ribosomes on their outer surface. Bruch's membrane (complexus basalis) shows a pentalaminate structure but with only a poorly represented central elastic lamina. Profiles of the choriocapillaris are relatively small and the endothelium of these capillaries while extremely thin facing the retinal epithelium is but minimally fenestrated.
1100	2134363	Retinal photoreceptor fine structure in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Braekevelt CR	Histol Histopathol	 1990 Apr;5(2):123-31		The retinal photoreceptors of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) consist of rods, single cones and double (unequal) cones present in a ratio of about 1:2:1. The rods have relatively large cylindrical outer segments which in the light-adapted state reach to the retinal epithelial (RPE) cell bodies and are surrounded by the pigment-laden apical processes of these RPE cells. The inner segment displays an apically located ellipsoid of mitochondria and plentiful polysomes, some rough ER and Golgi zones. The rod nucleus is located within the outer nuclear layer and the synaptic pedicle displays both invaginated (ribbon) and superficial (conventional) synaptic sites. Single cones display a thin tapering outer segment, a large often heterogeneous oil droplet in the apical region of the inner segment, an ellipsoid of mitochondria and a prominent paraboloid of glycogen. Double cones consist of a larger chief member which shows a thin tapering outer segment, a large heterogeneous oil droplet and a prominent paraboloid. The small accessory cone shows a thin outer segment, a small granular oil droplet and a paraboloid. As in the single cone, polysomes, RER and Golgi zones are also present within the inner segment. Near the outer limiting membrane the two members of the double cone show a membrane specialization on their contiguous surfaces. Both single and double cones display several invaginated (ribbon) synapses as well as numerous superficial synaptic sites.
1101	15092218	Embryotoxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in three domestic avian species, and of PAHs and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the common eider.	Brunstrom B, Broman D, Naf C	Environ Pollut	 1990;67(2):133-43	 doi: 101016/0269-7491(90)90078-q	The embryotoxicity of an artificial mixture of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was tested by injection into the yolk sacs of eggs of four avian species: chicken Gallus domesticus, turkey Meleagris gallopavo, domestic duck Anas platyrhynchos and common eider Somateria mollissima. A dose of 2.0 mg kg egg(-1) of the PAH mixture increased the mortality among the embryos of all four species. In the domestic duck, but not in the three other species, there was a significantly increased embryonic mortality at a dose of 0.2 mg kg(-1) of this mixture. All 18 individual compounds in the mixture were tested for embryotoxicity in the chicken. The compound most toxic to chick embryos was benzo[k]fluoranthene. This substance also proved to be highly embryotoxic in the three other species. Previous studies have shown coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to be much more embryotoxic in the chicken than in other avian species studied. In accordance with this, eider duck embryos proved to be considerably less sensitive to 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl than was previously found for chick embryos. For PAHs, however, chick embryos did not have a higher sensitivity than the other species tested.
1102	2364668	Biliary bile acid profiles of domestic fowl as determined by high performance liquid chromatography and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.	Elkin RG, Wood KV, Hagey LR	Comp Biochem Physiol B	 1990;96(1):157-61	 doi: 101016/0305-0491(90)90356-x	1. The biliary bile acid profiles of domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). 2. Chenodeoxycholyltaurine and cholyltaurine were the predominant bile acids in chicken and turkey bile, whereas duck bile contained primarily chenodeoxycholyltaurine and phocaecholyltaurine. 3. Allocholyltaurine was also detected in chicken and turkey bile, but not in duck bile. 4. FAB-MS analyses of individual HPLC peak fractions from chicken and duck bile extracts confirmed the presence of either taurine-conjugated dihydroxy- or trihydroxycholanoates. 5. Direct FAB-MS analyses of avian bile extracts not subjected to HPLC permitted a rapid assessment of the relative proportion of taurine-conjugated dihydroxy- to trihydroxycholanoates.
1103	2304203	Differential white blood cell values of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) across different ages and reproductive states.	Fairbrother A, O'Loughlin D	J Wildl Dis	 1990 Jan;26(1):78-82	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-26178	Differential white blood cell counts were recorded for adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of both sexes during several stages of reproduction: pre-egg laying, egg laying, incubating, molting, and postreproductive. Similar counts were made for young birds from 5 to 60 days of age. No significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) differences amongst the cell ratios due to sex or reproductive state of the adult birds were noted. Nonlaying and laying birds had similar numbers of thrombocytes which were significantly greater than thrombocyte numbers of incubating, molting or postreproductive birds. Young birds had a decrease in the percent lymphocytes from 50 to greater than 60 days of age and a concomitant, compensating increase in percent heterophils. Thrombocyte numbers increased from 5 days of age to a peak at 18 days of age, after which they did not vary significantly.
1104	2304202	Changes in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) serum chemistry due to age, sex, and reproductive condition.	Fairbrother A, Craig MA, Walker K, O'Loughlin D	J Wildl Dis	 1990 Jan;26(1):67-77	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-26167	Selected serum constituents were analyzed from 50 adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) of both sexes during several stages of reproduction: pre-egg laying, egg laying, incubating, molting, and postreproductive. Similar assays were conducted on sera from ducklings aged 5 to 58 days. Values for total protein (TPR), albumin (ALB), glucose (GLU), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), calcium (CA), phosphorus (PHOS) and magnesium (MG) differed by sex. When all data were combined and analyzed for sex-related differences within each reproductive condition separately, all assays except lactate dehydrogenase (LD-L), cholinesterase (CHE), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (CRN) and direct bilirubin (BIDI) differed between sexes during one or more reproductive periods. Each assay showed differences among the various reproductive conditions regardless of gender. The pattern of change differed between sexes. All assays except ALB, GLU, CA and MG showed age-related changes. Lipemia in the sample interfered with all chemistries except TPR, LD-L and CA. Results indicate that when using clinical chemistry as a diagnostic tool in the mallard, age and reproductive condition should be determined in order to compare the data to appropriate control values.
1105	2260767	The blood vessel supply of the testis in Pekin drakes (Anas platyrhynchos L.). Macroscopic, light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic studies	Kremer A, Budras KD	Anat Anz	 1990;171(2):73-87		Testes of Pekin ducks were macerated following injection with plastic at the period of maximal spermatogenesis which occurs during spring. The right and left A. testicularis arise from the A. renalis cranialis. The right testis is additionally supplied by an irregularly occurring A. testicularis accessoria. After penetrating the testicular capsule the arteries run to the centre of the testis and terminate as branching Aa. radiatae centrifugales. The seminiferous tubules are surrounded by intertubular and peritubular capillaries forming a rope-ladder-like system. Venules and veins run peripherally to enter the vein converge into the testicular hilus, and unite to form 2 Vv. testiculares which empty into the V. cava caudalis. Regulation of testicular blood supply is achieved by throttle devices depending on the avian seasonal cycle. The coiled and step-like course of the vessels results in a sufficient contact between blood and seminiferous tubules. Testicular veins surrounding the arteries might be an equivalent of the steroid transfer mechanism in the mammalian spermatic cord.
1106	2085951	Yolk-sac transmission and post-hatching ontogeny of serum immunoglobulins in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Liu SS, Higgins DA	Comp Biochem Physiol B	 1990;97(4):637-44	 doi: 101016/0305-0491(90)90100-8	1. To investigate the immunoglobulin (Ig) class which is active in yolk-sac transmission of maternal antibodies in ducks, sera from laying ducks, yolks from their eggs, and sera from ducklings 0-87 days of age were examined by immunoelectrophoresis (IE), and Na2SO4-precipitated Igs from these sera and yolks were run in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions. 2. In yolk, 7.8S IgG was greatly enriched compared to 5.7S IgG and IgM, and was the only Ig to reach the sera of newly hatched ducklings. 3. The levels of maternally derived 7.8S IgG in duckling sera decreased after 5 days of age, reaching minimum levels at about 14 days of age. 4. Increases in the serum levels of 7.8S IgG, 5.7S IgG and IgM occurred after 20 days of age, reflecting de novo synthesis by the duckling, and the adult serum profile was achieved by 71 days of age. 5. The involvement of 7.8S rather than 5.7S IgG in yolk-sac transmission was probably determined by the additional heavy chain components of this molecule.
1107	1977550	Effects of ingested crude oil on thyroid hormones and on the mixed function oxidase system in ducks.	Jenssen BM, Ekker M, Zahlsen K	Comp Biochem Physiol C Comp Pharmacol Toxicol	 1990;95(2):213-6	 doi: 101016/0742-8413(90)90106-j	1. Ingestion of Statfjord A crude oil from the North Sea has no apparent effect on the metabolic rate of ducks (Jenssen, 1989). This may be because this particular oil does not affect plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones and enzyme activities in the mixed function oxidase (MFO) system of ducks. 2. To test this hypothesis, plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine), and levels of hepatic cytochrome P-450 and enzyme activities (NADPH cytochrome C reductase and GSH-S-transferase) in the MFO system were measured in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) which had ingested this crude oil. 3. Daily oral of 5 ml crude oil per kg body weight for 6 consecutive days resulted in a 53% increase in plasma triiodothyronine concentration and a 56% increase in the hepatic cytochrome P-450 level. The changes in these parameters were apparently not sufficient to cause any rise in metabolic heat production. 4. This apparent contradiction is probably because activation of the MFO-system is energetically inexpensive. Also, possible metabolic effects caused by increased plasma-triiodothyronine concentration and activation of the MFO-system may have been masked by an inhibitory effect of the crude oil on mitochondrial electrontransport and coupled phosphorylation.
1108	2611861	Pre-natal development of the adrenal gland in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Cronshaw J, Holmes WN, Ely JA, Redondo JL	Cell Tissue Res	 1989 Dec;258(3):593-601	 doi: 101007/BF00218872	The differentiating nephrotome in the 10-day-old mallard duck embryo is able to synthesize corticosterone, aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone even though an adrenal anlage cannot be identified histologically until the 12th day of incubation. At this time, sudanophilic cells containing much smooth endoplasmic reticulum and numerous mitochondria with tubular cristae are located adjacent to the developing mesonephros. Chromaffin cells appear in this region on about the 14th day of embryogenesis. A discrete glandular structure containing measurable quantities of corticosteroids can be identified on the 15th day, and during the next 2 days the tissue becomes encapsulated. Concomitantly, the ACTH-inducible rates of corticosteroid hormone synthesis increase several fold. The corticotropic responsiveness of the developing adrenal steroidogenic tissue increases progressively during the remainder of embryogenesis.
1109	2596581	Intracellular Ca2+] and inositol phosphates in avian nasal gland cells.	Shuttleworth TJ, Thompson JL	Am J Physiol	 1989 Nov;257(5 Pt 1):C1020-9	 doi: 101152/ajpcell19892575C1020	Isolated cells from the nasal salt gland of ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) were evaluated as a model system for the study of the muscarinic activation of exocrine ion secretion. Cells loaded with the fluorescent probe indo-1 were used to study changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) after stimulation. Changes in inositol phosphate generation and oxygen consumption were also determined. Loading with the acetomethoxy ester form of indo-1 (indo-1/AM) was rapid, and intracellular cleavage of the ester was essentially complete. Leakage of the dye was negligible over the time course of measurements (up to 20 min). Resting [Ca2+]i was approximately 100 nM. Stimulation with carbachol resulted in progressive increases in the generation of inositol phosphates and rapid four- to fivefold increases in [Ca2+]i. At normal extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, [Ca2+]i remained elevated (approximately 3 times resting levels) for as long as stimulation continued. Experiments showed that the increases in [Ca2+]i were comprised of a combination of release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and an enhanced entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. It is specifically this latter process that produces the sustained elevations in [Ca2+]i that are the essential signal for secretory activity.
1110	2810550	Antigenic and phenotypic variants of a virulent avian influenza virus selected during replication in ducks.	Philpott MS, Easterday BC, Hinshaw VS	J Wildl Dis	 1989 Oct;25(4):507-13	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-254507	To evaluate the replication of a highly virulent avian influenza A virus in a potential reservoir host, mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were inoculated with the virulent strain A/Ty/Ont/7732/66 (H5N9). Viruses recovered from the ducks were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found to possess antigenically altered viral hemagglutinins. Plaque formation on the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line and on primary chicken embryo cells was investigated, and isolates recovered from the ducks differed from the wild type by being unable to form plaques on MDCK cells without trypsin. This phenotype did not appear to be due to inefficient cleavage of the hemagglutinin by host cell proteases since hemagglutinin immunoprecipitated from cell lysates was cleaved. Although the plaquing phenotype suggested attenuation of the isolates from the ducks, they were not significantly altered in their virulence for chickens shown by infectivity studies in vivo. These results indicate that replication of influenza A/Ty/Ont/7732/66 virus in ducks can produce antigenic and phenotypic variants which are still highly virulent for domestic poultry.
1111	2817509	Verminous pancreatitis in Anas platyrhynchos	Popp A, Schuster R	Angew Parasitol	 1989 Aug;30(3):193-4		9 helminth species were found in a young mallard by helminthological dissection of its alimentary tract. The severe pathological alterations in the gut were caused by Filicollis anatis. One female acanthocephalan had entered the pancreas with its proboscis via one of the efferent ducts and caused an inflammation.
1112	2759358	Maternal and peer imprinting in mallard ducklings under experimentally simulated natural social conditions.	Dyer AB, Lickliter R, Gottlieb G	Dev Psychobiol	 1989 Jul;22(5):463-75	 doi: 101002/dev420220505	Previous studies revealed that if socially reared mallard ducklings actively follow a stuffed mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) hen, they later show a visual preference for the familiar mallard hen over an unfamiliar redhead (Aythya americana) hen. The present study determined that the experience of actively following the hen is essential to the induction of a visually controlled, species-typical, maternal preference. Domestic mallard ducklings that had not been given the opportunity to follow the mallard hen were "passively" reared in social groups consisting of a stuffed mallard hen and seven same-aged siblings for either 24, 48, or 72 hr after hatching. These birds were largely unresponsive to the hen in a later choice test, even when they were passively exposed to the mallard hen for as long as 72 hr prior to testing. The question arose as to whether passive exposure to the ducklings induced a preference for them that interfered with establishment of maternal imprinting under these simulated natural nest conditions. Results indicated that socially reared ducklings do prefer stuffed ducklings to a stuffed mallard hen in a simultaneous choice test even when the hen is present and vocalizing during social rearing. Further, even ducklings reared individually with the mallard hen were unresponsive to her in the later choice test. That there is something special about the stimulation provided by ducklings was further demonstrated by the finding that stuffed ducklings were preferred over the mallard hen (1) when the social rearing situation precluded active physical interaction with live ducklings and (2) when reared with inanimate stuffed ducklings. Thus, the ineffectiveness of the stuffed mallard hen in inducing visual imprinting under simulated nesting conditions cannot be attributed to the fact that she was not alive or reciprocally interactive. The present results suggest that mallard ducklings do not become visually imprinted to their hen until after departure from the nest, that the visual component of maternal imprinting likely involves active following subsequent to nest departure, and that early in postnatal development siblings are more visually attractive than is the hen.
1113	2737449	Steroid C-20 oxidoreductase activity of duck intestinal mucosa: the interrelations of the enzymatic activity with steroid binding.	DiBattista JA, Mehdi AZ, Sandor T	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1989 Apr;74(1):136-47	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(89)90122-6	The binding of corticosterone and aldosterone to domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos)-dispersed colonic mucosal cells at 37 degrees was investigated. It was found that in contrast to experiments using cell-free intestinal preparations, corticosterone was extensively metabolized and it was the metabolite, not the native steroid that became receptor bound and all the bound ligand was in the nuclear fraction. The metabolite turned out to be identical with 4-pregnene-11 beta,20 beta, 21-triol-3-one (20 beta-dihydrocorticosterone, 20 beta-DHB). Binding experiments with [3H]corticosterone yielded the following kinetic parameters: Kd = 87.6 nM, Nmax = 337,900 sites/cell. When synthetic [3H]20 beta-DHB was used as the ligand a curvilinear-binding isotherm was obtained. This could be resolved into a high affinity-low capacity (HA) and a low affinity-high capacity (LA) component with the following binding parameters: Kd,HA = 91 nM, Nmax,HA = 130,800 sites/cell; Kd,LA = 5.4 x 10(-6) M, Nmax, LA = 3.7 x 10(6) sites/cell. Binding of the metabolite to cell-free preparations, at 0 degree, gave the following results: for cytosol, linear-binding isotherm, Kd = 14.0 nM, Nmax = 26.5 fmol/mg protein; and for crude nuclei, curvilinear-binding isotherm, Kd,HA = 45.0 nM, Nmax, HA = 5.33 pmol/mg DNA; Kd,LA = 2.2 x 10(-6) M, Nmax,LA = 286.6 pmol/mg DNA. [3H]Aldosterone was also bound by the dispersed whole cells and again, this binding was only nuclear (Kd = 9.3 nM, Nmax = 10,042 sites/cell). The bound ligand was unchanged aldosterone. Competition experiments have shown that aldosterone did not compete with 20 beta-DHB for binding sites and vice versa. The intracellular 20 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase responsible for the transformation of corticosterone was found mostly in the cytoplasm. Kinetic studies with the enzyme yielded classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 15.7 microM, Vmax = 2.6 nmol/min/mg protein). The enzyme had an apparent Mr of 35 kDa and a Rs of 25.5 A. It is believed that our results might explain the binding of aldosterone to mineralocorticoid-binding sites in the presence of overwhelming concentrations of corticosterone and that experiments with cell-free tissue preparations, performed at 0 degree, do not reflect the true cellular-binding events.
1114	2716116	A comparison of two methods to establish the prevalence of lead shot ingestion in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from The Netherlands.	Lumeij JT, Scholten H	J Wildl Dis	 1989 Apr;25(2):297-9	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-252297	Two collection methods for screening the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population in the Netherlands for the ingestion of spent lead shot were compared. One method consisted of examination of gizzards from mallards shot by hunters (n = 2,859) and the other method consisted of examination of gizzards from mallards caught in duck traps (n = 865). The 95% confidence interval of lead shot ingestion in the mallard population estimated by the first method was 1.7 to 2.9% and by the second method 1.1 to 3.1%. These values were not significantly different. From the numbers of lead pellets embedded in the gizzard wall in hunter-killed and trapped mallards it was estimated that at least 22 to 68% of the trapped ducks had been hit by lead shot previously, but survived. Furthermore, this study shows that it is reasonable to assume that a substantial part of the pellets which are identified (in this study and other studies) as ingested, may well have been shot into the gizzard lumen at some time before the birds were actually killed. To avoid lead poisoning in mallards and in raptors depredating waterfowl hit by lead shot, a change to steel shot is advocated.
1115	2716102	Concentration of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase in the blood of wild mallards following capture by three methods for banding.	Bollinger T, Wobeser G, Clark RG, Nieman DJ, Smith JR	J Wildl Dis	 1989 Apr;25(2):225-31	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-252225	The concentration of the enzymes creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), that are released from damaged muscle, was measured in the blood of wild adult male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) captured for banding in decoy and bait traps and by rocket net. The concentration of CK and to a lesser extent AST was elevated markedly in ducks captured by all methods, indicating muscle injury. The level of CK was significantly greater in ducks captured in decoy traps and rocket net than in those captured in bait traps. This elevation appeared to be related to the length of time the birds were restrained and to the method of restraint.
1116	2716097	Comparative toxicity of lead shot in black ducks (Anas rubripes) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Rattner BA, Fleming WJ, Bunck CM	J Wildl Dis	 1989 Apr;25(2):175-83	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-252175	In winter, pen-reared and wild black ducks (Anas rubripes), and game farm and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), maintained on pelleted feed, were sham-dosed or given one number 4 lead shot. After 14 days, dosed birds were redosed with two or four additional lead shot. This dosing regimen also was repeated in summer using pen-reared black ducks and game farm mallards. Based upon mortality, overt intoxication, weight change, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity and protoporphyrin concentration, black ducks and mallards were found to be equally tolerant to lead shot. However, captive wild ducks were more sensitive than their domesticated counterparts, as evidenced by greater mortality and weight loss following lead shot administration. This difference may be related to stress associated with captivity and unnatural diet.
1117	2707492	Alarm call responsivity of mallard ducklings: VIII. Interaction between developmental history and behavioral context.	Blaich CF, Miller DB, Hicinbothom G	Dev Psychobiol	 1989 Apr;22(3):203-10	 doi: 101002/dev420220302	Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call of their species. The present study assesses the interaction of the ducklings' experiential history with the environment in which they are tested. If ducklings are reared and tested to the alarm call in small social groups, they respond by dramatically inhibiting their vocalizations. If, however, socially reared ducklings are tested to the alarm call individually in an open field, responsiveness drops precipitously. In addition, individually reared ducklings respond at a far greater level to the alarm call when tested individually, not in groups. Thus, there is an interaction between the rearing history and the testing environment such that the same rearing history leads to different behavioral outcomes depending on the context in which the ducklings are observed. This demonstrates the importance of behavioral context, in addition to developmental history, as one of the determinants of behavior.
1118	29865628	Mechanics of drinking in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos, anatidae).	Kooloos JGM, Zweers GA	J Morphol	 1989 Mar;199(3):327-347	 doi: 101002/jmor1051990308	Water drinking in the mallard is accomplished by a fine-tuned set of movements of upper and lower jaw and of the tongue. During immersion of the tips of the bill, the oral cavity is formed into smaller volumes containing water and into connecting tubes. Two mechanisms serve the water transport: (1) lingual and jaw movements press water from the water-containing spaces into the tubes; (2) a quantitative simulation of the shape of the oral cavity during immersion shows that the two tubes are so narrow that capillary action also contributes to water transport. Thereafter, the tips of the bill are raised until they point upward. In this "tip-up" position, water flows into the esophagus because of gravity. We conclude that, in addition to normal tip-up drinking observed in almost all Passeriformes and Galliformes, a second type of tip-up drinking may be distinguished in Anseriformes. The integration of the drinking mechanism, keeping the water inside the mouth, and the straining mechanism, expelling the water along the beak rims, is effected by specific actions of the elaborate lingual apparatus.
1119	2925188	Hormonal correlates of male attractiveness during mate selection in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Klint T, Edsman L, Holmberg K, Silverin B	Horm Behav	 1989 Mar;23(1):83-91	 doi: 101016/0018-506x(89)90076-7	The aims of the present study were (1) to examine if feeding condition prior to mating influences male hormone levels and behavior, (2) to evaluate the effect of age on male hormone levels, (3) to examine a possible association between male social display activity and four steroid hormones (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrogen, and corticosterone), and (4) to examine if female behavior influences male hormone levels. Thirty male and fifteen female mallards were used in this study. Observations were made on a mixed flock of mallards for 10 consecutive days in autumn. Five weeks before the observations, males were randomly assigned to a feeding regime with either an unlimited food supply (UL group) or a limited food supply (L group). Males in the UL group showed significantly greater social display activity compared to the L group males. Females never incited (courted) males from the L group. Dihydrotestosterone levels were significantly higher in males showing social display activity as compared to males not showing these behavior patterns. Testosterone levels were significantly higher in males incited by females compared to males not incited by females.
1120	2704698	Renal function in freshwater and chronically saline-stressed male and female Pekin ducks.	Hughes MR, Roberts JR, Thomas BR	Poult Sci	 1989 Mar;68(3):408-16	 doi: 103382/ps0680408	Hematocrit (Hct) and plasma ionic and osmotic concentrations were measured in Pekin Ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, drinking freshwater (FW), during rapid acclimation to sea water (RA), and after 6 mo exposure to 180-mM NaCl (SW). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) were measured in FW and SW ducks. Estimated renal plasma flow (ERPF) was measured in SW ducks. During RA, Hct and plasma concentration increased significantly (P less than .05) when drinking water sodium concentration ([Na]dw) was 300 mM; body mass decreased (P less than .01) when [Na]dw was 375 mM. The Hct and plasma ionic or osmotic concentrations of FW and SW ducks were the same, except that female SW ducks had lower (P less than .05) plasma chloride concentrations than FW female ducks. Relative to body mass, the FW female duck ECFV (26.88%) was larger (P less than .01) than that of the male (17.50%). The ECFV was not affected by SW in either sex. Mean (+/- SE) GFR determined using inulin and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the same five FW ducks, were the same, 4.4 +/- .7 and 4.7 +/- .6 mL(min.kg)-1, respectively. In female FW ducks, the GFR (PEG) was 5.00 +/- .30 mL(min.kg)-1, significantly (P less than .001) greater than that of the male, which was 3.07 +/- .21 mL(min.kg)-1. Female and male SW duck GFR were 3.96 +/- .57 and 2.60 +/- .37 mL(min.kg)-1, respectively, but the decrease in GFR was significant (P less than .05) only for females. The GFR were the same, relative to kidney mass, in both sexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1121	2930449	Characterization of Campylobacter spp. from wild birds	Glunder G	Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr	 1989 Feb 1;102(2):49-52		Bacteria of the genus Campylobacter were isolated from 28 Rooks (Corvus frugilegus), 1 Red Kite (Milvus milvus), 1 Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), 1 Coot (Fulica atra), 1 Common Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) and 1 Northern Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Altogether, C. jejuni biovar 1, was isolated 19x, C. jejuni biovar 2 8x and C. coli 5x. Among C. jejuni biovar 1 and 2 there were 5 isolates tolerating a content of 1.5% NaCl in the medium. H2S proof of 3 C. jejuni biovar 2 and 1 C. coli isolates resulted positive or negative dependent on incubation time of the used bacterial inoculum. Concerning Rooks the findings indicate that nestlings are more often infected with campylobacters than older birds. Only 1 campylobacter isolate could be recovered from altogether 54 birds of prey although 16 Buzzards (Buteo buteo) were investigated as nestlings.
1122	2914566	Effects of ingested crude and dispersed crude oil on thermoregulation in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Jenssen BM	Environ Res	 1989 Feb;48(1):49-56	 doi: 101016/s0013-9351(89)80084-2	Thermoregulatory effects of ingested doses of Statfjord A crude oil and of this oil mixed with the dispersant Finasol OSR-5 were studied in adult domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) exposed to ambient temperatures of +16 degrees C and -17 degrees C. The data show that ingestion of both the crude and the oil-dispersant mixture resulted in an increased body temperature during exposure to the low ambient temperature (-17 degrees C). Neither contaminant had any effect on body temperature during exposure to +16 degrees C. Ingestion of the contaminants had no effect on metabolic heat production at either ambient temperature. The breast skin temperature of the ducks in both contaminated groups was significantly decreased when the ducks were exposed to the low ambient temperature. This indicates that the increase in body temperature observed in the contaminated ducks at the low ambient temperature is due to an increase in peripheral vasoconstriction.
1123	2924542	Classical bile acids in animals, beta-phocaecholic acid in ducks.	Jirsa M, Klinot J, Klinotova E, Ubik K, Kucera K	Comp Biochem Physiol B	 1989;92(2):357-60	 doi: 101016/0305-0491(89)90291-5	1. Bile samples of different animals were analysed and the percentage content of classical bile acids was determined. 2. Herbivorous birds mostly excreted a large proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid. 3. The anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) excreted deoxycholic acid most probably as a primary bile acid. 4. In the bile of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) a large amount of (23R)3 alpha, 7 alpha, 23-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid (beta-phocaecholic acid) was found.
1124	2783741	Experimental infections of waterfowl with Sphaeridiotrema globulus (Digenea).	Huffman JE, Roscoe DE	J Wildl Dis	 1989 Jan;25(1):143-6	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-251143	Sphaeridiotrema globulus in experimentally infected mute swans (Cygnus olor), mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) induced ulcerative hemorrhagic enteritis. Sites of infection include the jejunum and ileum. The digeneans ulcerated the intestine. The inflammatory response was primarily lymphocytic with some eosinophils. Severe hemorrhage from damaged submucosal capillaries provided a blood meal for the parasite and caused anemia in the host. Extra-medullary hematopoiesis occurred in the liver, and an erythroid hyperplasia occurred in the bone marrow of infected birds. Infected birds exhibited muscular weakness and died from shock associated with severe blood loss. Mallards and Canada geese were less susceptible to fatal infection than the mute swan as evidenced by survivors in the higher dose groups.
1125	2721160	Metabolism of aldosterone in the colostomized duck (Anas platyrhynchos): partial characterization of urinary metabolites.	Gorsline J, Morris DJ, Holmes WN	Comp Biochem Physiol B	 1989;92(4):773-7	 doi: 101016/0305-0491(89)90266-6	1. Chronically colostomized ducks were injected with [4-14C]-aldosterone to study the metabolism of aldosterone and the pattern of metabolite excretion via the kidney. 2. Nearly half of the injected dose was excreted as radiometabolites during the first 24 hr; the largest amounts being excreted during the first 3 hr after injection. 3. Ion-exchange chromatography showed that monosulfate, disulfate, glucuronide, acidic, and neutral metabolites were excreted during each collection period, and that their relative proportions changed with time after injection of [4-14C]-aldosterone. 4. HPLC analysis of the neutral radiometabolites revealed 15 major peaks with retention times corresponding to both polar and reduced derivatives of aldosterone. 5. Only small quantities of unaltered labelled aldosterone were excreted. 6. Treatment of the birds with SKF 525-A caused a decrease in the total quantity of radiometabolite excreted and a change in the proportions of neutral and acidic metabolites in the cloacal fluid. 7. The decreases that occurred in the absolute amounts of some of the polar metabolites excreted by the birds treated with SKF-525A suggests that they may be hydroxylated and at least part of the aldosterone metabolizing system in the duck is cytochrome P450 dependent.
1126	2718348	The prevalence of lead shot ingestion in wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the Netherlands.	Lumeij JT, Hendriks H, Timmers A	Vet Q	 1989 Jan;11(1):51-5	 doi: 101080/0165217619899694196	During the hunting season 1986-1987, 2859 gizzards from mallards shot in the Netherlands were collected. Gizzards were selected radiographically and examined visually for ingested lead shot. The 95% confidence interval of the prevalence of lead shot ingestion was calculated to be 1.7 to 2.9%. In some gizzards a large number of lead shot (12-16) were seen. This is an indication for locally heavily contaminated areas. Especially places where mallards are attracted for hunting purposes, by daily feeding of corn, predispose these birds to lead poisoning. A ban with regard to these hunting practices will probably drastically reduce the prevalence of lead shot ingestion. A change from lead shot to steel shot will solve the problem completely.
1127	2644453	Experimental inoculation of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) with Borrelia burgdorferi.	Burgess EC	J Wildl Dis	 1989 Jan;25(1):99-102	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-25199	Birds have been incriminated as disseminaters of Borrelia burgdorferi and have the potential to spread the organism over a wide geographic range. Borrelia burgdorferi has been isolated from the liver and blood of passerine birds and from Ixodes dammini removed from passerines. The objective of this study was to determine if waterfowl, specifically mallards (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos), were susceptible to infection with B. burgdorferi. Eight ducks were inoculated with B. burgdorferi; four orally and four intravenously (i.v.) and two ducks were inoculated with phosphate buffered saline as controls. All eight inoculated birds became infected and developed antibodies to B. burgdorferi. The spirochete was isolated from cloacal material from an orally infected duck on day 22 postinoculation (PI) and from an i.v. infected bird on day 29 PI, from the blood of an i.v. infected bird on day 7 PI, and from the kidney of an orally infected bird. Borrelia burgdorferi was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using the B. burgdorferi specific monoclonal antibody H5332 in kidneys of three orally infected birds and one i.v. infected bird and from the mesentery of one orally infected bird. These findings show that mallard ducks are susceptible to infection by B. burgdorferi and that they can be infected orally and shed the organism in the droppings. Thus, mallards could disseminate B. burgdorferi over long distances without the need of an arthropod vector.
1128	2636811	Histomorphological changes in the oviduct of the mallard (Aves: Anatidae).	Sharma RK, Duda PL	Acta Morphol Neerl Scand	 1989;27(3-4):183-92		Studies on histomorphometrical changes in different segments (infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, shell gland and vagina) of oviduct of mallard, Anas platyrhynchos during active and quiescent phases of the reproductive cycle have been made. The absolute and per cent length and width of each segment showed a marked change. The magnum showed an increase of 280 per cent. Of all the histological parameters studied the number and height of mucosal folds and mucosal epithelium showed more marked increase in all segments of oviduct. The size of tubular glands and frequency of ciliated and secretory cells were studied in relation to oviductal activity.
1129	2565790	Changes in the adrenal steroidogenic responsiveness of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) during early post-natal development.	Holmes WN, Redondo JL, Cronshaw J	Comp Biochem Physiol A Comp Physiol	 1989;92(3):403-8	 doi: 101016/0300-9629(89)90582-3	1. Plasma concentrations of corticosterone (B), aldosterone (Aldo) and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) were measured in mallard ducklings immediately before and after exposure to acute immobilization stress. 2. Except for transient declines in B and DOC between the 4th and 14th days after hatching, the resting concentration of each hormone did not change significantly during post-natal development. 3. The stress-induced in Aldo was maximal at hatching while maximal increases in B and DOC did not occur until one day later. 4. Thereafter the magnitude of the stress-induced increases in the concentrations of all of the hormones decreased steadily and on the 21st and 28th days after hatching only B increased significantly in response to stress.
1130	2543834	Hepatic glutathione metabolism and lipid peroxidation in response to excess dietary selenomethionine and selenite in mallard ducklings.	Hoffman DJ, Heinz GH, Krynitsky AJ	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1989;27(2):263-71	 doi: 101080/15287398909531296	Studies were conducted with mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings to determine the effects of excess dietary selenium (Se) on hepatic glutathione concentration and associated enzymes, and lipid peroxidation. Day-old ducklings were fed 0.1, 10, 20, or 40 ppm Se as seleno-DL-methionine or sodium selenite for 6 wk. Selenium from selenomethionine accumulated in a dose-dependent manner in the liver, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of hepatic-reduced glutathione (GSH) and total hepatic thiols (SH). These effects were accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in the ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH, and an increase in malondialdehyde concentration as evidence of lipid peroxidation. Hepatic and plasma GSH peroxidase activity was initially elevated at 10 ppm Se as selenomethionine, whereas GSSG reductase activity was elevated at higher dietary concentrations of Se. Selenium from sodium selenite accumulated in the liver to an apparent maximum at 10 ppm in the diet, resulting in an increase in hepatic GSH and GSSG accompanied by a small decrease in total hepatic SH. Sodium selenite resulted in an increase in hepatic GSSG reductase activity at 10 ppm and in plasma GSSG reductase activity at 40 ppm. A small increase in lipid peroxidation occurred at 40 ppm. These findings indicate that excess dietary Se as selenomethionine has a more pronounced effect on hepatic glutathione metabolism and lipid peroxidation in ducklings than does selenite, which may be related to the pattern of accumulation. Effects of Se as selenite appear to be less pronounced in ducklings than reported in laboratory rodents. The effects of selenomethionine, which occurs in vegetation, are of particular interest with respect to the health of wild aquatic birds in seleniferous locations.
1131	2522769	Experimental infections in domestic ducks with Cryptosporidium baileyi isolated from chickens.	Lindsay DS, Blagburn BL, Sundermann CA, Hoerr FJ	Avian Dis	 1989 Jan-Mar;33(1):69-73		Oral inoculation of 13 ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) with 1 x 10(6) Cryptosporidium baileyi oocysts produced patent infections but no clinical signs of disease. Intratracheal inoculation of 13 ducks with 1 x 10(6) C. baileyi oocysts produced only mild clinical signs of respiratory disease, no deaths, and gross lesions of airsacculitis in only three ducks. The distribution of developmental stages of C. baileyi in ducks was similar to that observed in experimentally infected chickens and turkeys. Results of this study indicate that ducks are more resistant to experimentally induced respiratory cryptosporidiosis caused by C. baileyi than are chickens and turkeys.
1132	2502359	Precipitating antibodies of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Higgins DA	Comp Biochem Physiol B	 1989;93(1):135-44	 doi: 101016/0305-0491(89)90227-7	1. Ducks do not usually produce precipitating antibodies. However, when hyperimmunized with the dinitrophenyl (DNP)-human IgG (HIgG) conjugate, ducks made precipitating antibodies to the HIgG carrier, though not to the DNP hapten. 2. Precipitation did not require NaCl and occurred over a wide range of molarities and pH. 3. Antigenic and polyacrylamide gel analysis of affinity-purified antibodies, indicated that the major constituent of the antibody population was electrophoretically homogeneous 5.7S IgG. 4. The Ig heavy chains were in two populations, viz MW 37,000 and 41,000; non-precipitating duck 5.7S IgG antibodies to HIgG had only the MW 37,000 heavy chains. 5. It is suggested that duck precipitins belong to a previously unrecognized subclass of duck 5.7S IgG, with minor physical and antigenic differences from their non-precipitating counterparts.
1133	3254886	The arrangement of the muscle at the ileo-caeco-rectal junction of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and the presence of anatomical sphincters.	Mahdi AH, McLelland J	J Anat	 1988 Dec;161:133-42		The arrangement of the muscle at the ileo-caeco-rectal junction of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was studied using light microscopy, three-dimensional reconstruction models and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The junction consists of a papilla-like protrusion of the ileum into the rectum, the 'ileal papilla', lateral to which are the openings of the large right and left caeca. The ileal papilla consists entirely of circular muscle which is not divided into an inner electron-dense portion and an outer electron-lucent portion as is the rest of the ileum. The longitudinal muscle layer does not enter the ileal papilla. The circular muscle at the junction forms three thickenings or sphincters which are continuous with one another: an ileal sphincter in the ileal papilla, and right and left caecal sphincters around the orifices of the caeca. The majority of nerve bundles are found in the circular muscle layer and consist of axons with small granular vesicles, axons with small agranular vesicles and axons with many large granular vesicles. The density of innervation, including the total number of axon profiles and the number of vesiculated axon profiles, is significantly higher in the circular muscle of the sphincters than in the ileum, caecum and rectum 5 mm from the junction.
1134	2906084	In-vitro control of growth hormone secretion by synthetic releasing factors in young and adult ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Foltzer-Jourdainne C, Harvey S, Mialhe P	J Endocrinol	 1988 Dec;119(3):421-9	 doi: 101677/joe01190421	Release of GH from perifused duckling hemipituitaries was stimulated, in a biphasic manner, by synthetic TRH and human pancreatic GH-releasing factor (GRF). At all effective concentrations, the level of GH release was increased within 5 min of TRH or GRF perifusion and was maximal after 10 min of TRH perifusion and after 20 min of GRF perifusion. Although TRH was perifused for 20 min the level of GH release declined during the last 10 min. The most effective dose of TRH (1.0 micrograms/ml; 2.7 mumol/l) and GRF (0.5 micrograms/ml; 110 nmol/l) provoked similar (250-300%) increases in the level of GH release. However, since the effect of TRH was only of short duration, the total release of GH induced by GRF was higher than that elicited by TRH, especially with the low dose. The increase in release of GH induced by TRH or GRF was blunted when pituitaries from adult ducks were used. As in young ducks, the GH response to GRF was higher, whereas the response to TRH was very low. The GH response of perifused adult pituitaries to GRF was, however, potentiated when TRH was perifused simultaneously. The basal release of GH from both young and adult pituitary glands was unaffected by perifusion with somatostatin-14 (SRIF-14) at doses of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml. The perifusion of hemipituitary glands with similar doses of SRIF-14 was also unable to suppress the stimulation of GH release induced by prior perifusion with GRF, although when SRIF-14 and TRH were simultaneously perifused TRH-induced GH release was markedly suppressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Markham OD, Halford DK, Rope SK, Kuzo GB	Health Phys	 1988 Sep;55(3):517-24	 doi: 101097/00004032-198809000-00002	Concentrations of 90Sr, 238Pu, 239,240Pu, 241Am, 242Cm and 244Cm were determined in tissues of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) maintained for 43-145 d on radioactive leaching ponds in southeastern Idaho. Highest concentrations of transuranics occurred in the gastrointestinal tract, followed closely by feathers. Approximately 75%, 18%, 6% and 1% of the total transuranic activity in tissues analyzed were associated with the bone, feathers, GI tract and liver, respectively. Concentrations in GI tracts were similar to concentrations in vegetation and insects in the littoral area of the ponds. The calculated total dose rate to the ducks from both 90Sr and the transuranic nuclides was 0.69 mGy d-1 (69 mrad d-1), of which 99% was to the bone. The potential effective dose equivalent to a human consuming the entire muscle and liver mass of one experimental duck with average nuclide concentrations was 0.46 microSv (0.046 mrem). Based upon average concentrations in experimental ducks and on surveys of wild waterfowl using this area, a conservative estimate of transuranic activity exported by wild ducks using the ponds during one year was 11.3 kBq (305 nCi). Similarly, the total amount of 90Sr exported in muscle, bone and lung of wild ducks in one year was 2.5 MBq (68.7 microCi).
1136	3169377	Alarm call responsivity of mallard ducklings: VII. Auditory experience maintains freezing.	Miller DB, Blaich CF	Dev Psychobiol	 1988 Sep;21(6):523-33	 doi: 101002/dev420210603	Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) freeze upon hearing the maternal alarm call, which the hen issues when there are disturbances (e.g., potential predators) near the nest. Our previous work indicates that ducklings that have been devocalized embryonically and reared in auditory isolation exhibit a significant reduction in the incidence of freezing, as compared to vocal ducklings or to devocal ducklings that have been exposed to duckling sounds throughout the perinatal period up to the time of testing at 12 hr posthatch. The main purpose of this paper is to assess whether there is a prenatal or postnatal sensitive period for such auditory experience. Two groups of 30 devocalized ducklings were either (a) stimulated with duckling sounds prenatally and tested to the alarm call at 12 hr posthatch (Expt. 1), or (b) stimulated from the time of hatching to the time of testing at 12 hr (Expt. 2). These experiments rendered no conclusive evidence of either a prenatal or postnatal sensitive period, but they suggested that auditory experience might be important in maintaining freezing. To test this hypothesis, a third group of 30 ducklings was stimulated from hatching to 12 hr and tested at 24 hr (Expt. 3). Only those ducklings receiving auditory experience contiguous with the time of testing (Expt. 2) showed high levels of freezing. Whenever a gap occurred between the offset of stimulation and the onset of testing (Expts. 1 and 3), the incidence of freezing dropped. Thus, auditory experience is important in maintaining the freezing response. This effect contrasts markedly with traditional conceptions of sensitive periods.
1137	3169376	Development of species identification in ducklings: XV. Individual auditory recognition.	Gottlieb G	Dev Psychobiol	 1988 Sep;21(6):509-22	 doi: 101002/dev420210602	The present experiments examined the ability of domestic mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) to learn individual mallard maternal calls by either repetition-rate differences or spectral (Hz) differences, both of which are present in such calls recorded in nature. The ducklings could learn both kinds of differences within the first 24 hr after hatching, corresponding to the period prior to the exodus from the nest in nature. The hatchlings were able to learn these differences based upon only 12 min of exposure to the maternal calls during the first day after hatching. They were also able to retain (remember) the familiar call for an additional day after exposure. Embryos, on the other hand, could learn the spectral differences after either 12 or 24 min of exposure but could not retain the information under either exposure condition. An additional difference between the auditory learning competence of hatchlings and embryos was that the hatchlings were capable of learning the spectral features of a maternal call even if it was pulsed at different repetition rates during exposure (familiarization) and the subsequent test for recognition. The evolutionary significance of the results was discussed in terms of the general importance of familiarization as a basic behavioral mechanism underlying not only parental attachment but dietary and habitat preferences and the like.
1138	3397835	Hemolytic and coagulation properties of Sphaeridiotrema globulus (Trematoda).	Tabery P, Huffman JE, Fried B	J Parasitol	 1988 Aug;74(4):730-1		Metacercariae of Sphaeridiotrema globulus (Trematoda) were obtained from naturally infected Goniobasis virginica (Pleuroceridae). Excysted metacercariae were placed individually on blood-agar plates. After 8 hr of incubation at 42 C the plates exhibited beta-hemolysis. The reaction zone was approximately 1.5 mm in diameter. Laboratory-reared mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were infected with S. globulus. Mallards developed fatal sphaeridiotremiasis and demonstrated increased prothrombin time on days 3 and 6 postinfection.
1139	3411699	Ecological studies on Cyathocotyle bushiensis (Digenea) and Sphaeridiotrema globulus (Digenea), possible pathogens of dabbling ducks in southern Quebec.	Hoeve J, Scott ME	J Wildl Dis	 1988 Jul;24(3):407-21	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-243407	Over the past 20 yr, recurrent late-summer mortality of dabbling ducks in southern Quebec has been attributed to the digenean parasite Cyathocotyle bushiensis. This study attempted to determine whether this parasite was still implicated in the epizootics, and examined aspects of the ecology of the parasite in the definitive host. Comparison of prevalence and mean intensity of infection of all species of Digenea between salvaged carcasses and hunter-shot ducks revealed that C. bushiensis and a second digenean Sphaeridiotrema globulus were both significantly more prevalent in salvaged ducks. Mean intensity of infection was consistently higher for S. globulus in the salvaged carcasses than in hunter-shot ducks. These data provide strong circumstantial support for the hypothesis that C. bushiensis continues to contribute to the annual mortality, but also strongly suggest that S. globulus may be involved. Comparison of the relative numbers of each species of duck between the salvaged carcass sample and the hunter-shot sample revealed that blue-winged teal (Anas discors) occurred significantly more frequently in the salvaged carcass sample whereas wood ducks (Aix sponsa) were common in the hunter-shot sample but were never found in the salvaged carcass sample. A comparison of susceptibility to experimental infection with C. bushiensis revealed that mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), black ducks (Anas rubripes), blue-winged teal, pintail (Anas acuta) and lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) had similar susceptibilities but that wood ducks were significantly less susceptible to infection. Experimental infections also showed that age of mallards significantly influenced the number of parasites obtained 7 days postinfection; ducklings were most heavily infected. Significant differences were detected in the gross pathology caused by C. bushiensis among duck species. Data obtained from sentinel ducks placed in the field for 24 hr revealed that transmission of both C. bushiensis and S. globulus occurs at least between mid-May and mid-September and that large, potentially lethal, infections can be acquired in as little as 24 hr. Finally evidence is presented to suggest that ducks acquire resistance to challenge infections of C. bushiensis.
1140	3176302	Prevalence and pathology of helminth parasites in domestic ducks of Bangladesh.	Islam MR, Shaikh H, Baki MA	Vet Parasitol	 1988 Jul;29(1):73-7	 doi: 101016/0304-4017(88)90009-x	Parasitism in waterfowl is a very common phenomenon. Two detailed check lists of helminth parasites of waterfowl are available (Lapage, 1961; McDonald, 1969) and many of these parasites are reported to occur in domestic ducks. However, the pathological significance of most of them is unclear. In a preliminary study, Qadir (1979) recorded 13 species of helminths from domestic ducks of Bangladesh. The present paper reports on the prevalence and pathological effects of helminth infections in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) of Bangladesh under natural conditions and on their incidence in two age and sex groups of ducks.
1141	3378677	Social specificity: interaction with own species is necessary to foster species-specific maternal preference in ducklings.	Lickliter R, Gottlieb G	Dev Psychobiol	 1988 May;21(4):311-21	 doi: 101002/dev420210403	Previous studies have shown that if domestic mallard ducklings are allowed social interaction with broodmates after their initial exposure to a stuffed mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) hen, they later show a visual preference for the familiar mallard over an unfamiliar redhead (Aythya americana) hen. Birds kept in social isolation do not make this difficult discrimination. In the present study, we examined whether this social enhancement of imprintability to a natural maternal model is merely the result of social stimulation in its most general sense, or if its effects are specific to social interaction for 30 min (training). This experience resulted in visual preference for the familiar mallard hen over the unfamiliar redhead hen in simultaneous choices tests at 48 hr and 72 hr after hatching only if the birds were allowed social experience with a group of same-age undomesticated mallard hatchings. No visual preference for the familiar mallard hen was found if the ducklings were permitted social experience with a group of same-age chick (Gallus domesticus) hatchlings or muscovy (Cairina moschata) ducklings. Thus, it appears that for ducklings to show a visually imprinted preference for a natural maternal model, they must be allowed social interaction with broodmates of their own species. Social rearing with other precocial bird hatchlings, even other ducklings, is without apparent effect. These results provide further evidence of the importance of nonobvious experimental factors in the development of species-typical behavior. They also suggest that in the evolution of the species-specific learning underlying early species identification, natural selection has operated on the entire (organism-environment) developmental manifold and not merely on genetic, organic, or organismic aspects of that system.
1142	3373631	Effects of botulism on ducks drinking saline water.	Wobeser G	J Wildl Dis	 1988 Apr;24(2):240-5	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-242240	Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings (2 wk old) were given water from natural saline wetlands or fresh water as drinking water for 1 or 2 wk prior to, and after, receiving material containing Clostridium botulinum type C toxin. Water with conductivity ranging from 3,460 to 6,690 mu mhos/cm had no detectable effect on the occurrence or severity of clinical signs of botulism. Ducks drinking water with conductivity of 7,130 mu mhos/cm for 1 wk prior to receiving toxin had more severe clinical signs and greater mortality than did birds drinking fresh water. Ducks given the same water for 2 wk prior to receiving toxin did not differ from the controls in response to toxin. Fewer ducks in groups drinking the most saline water tested (conductivity = 13,500 mu mhos/cm) had clinical signs of botulism than in groups drinking fresh water.
1143	3227895	Parabronchial oxygen extraction in ducks during selective cooling of the spinal cord.	Johannesen H, Bech C	Acta Physiol Scand	 1988 Apr;132(4):563-7	 doi: 101111/j1748-17161988tb08366x	Pekin ducks Anas platyrhynchos were chronically equipped with thermodes in the vertebral canal. Metabolic heat production, parabronchial oxygen extraction, vertebral canal temperature and body temperature were measured simultaneously before and during spinal cooling, at ambient temperatures ranging from 6 to 25 degrees C. Lowering vertebral canal temperature from 41.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C to 35.9 +/- 0.6 degrees C gave a mean increase in metabolic heat production of 1.54 +/- 0.26 W kg-1. Even though the spinal cooling had a clear metabolic effect, there was no concomitant change in parabronchial oxygen extraction. It is concluded that the thermosensitive structures residing in the spinal cord are not involved in the regulation of parabronchial gas exchange. The increase in parabronchial oxygen extraction, which is reported during cold exposure in birds, may therefore be induced by thermal inputs from peripheral thermoreceptors.
1144	28311829	The effect of egg size variability on thermoregulation of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) offspring and its implications for survival.	Rhymer JM	Oecologia	 1988 Feb;75(1):20-24	 doi: 101007/BF00378809	There is a range of egg size phenotypes in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) that has a large genetic component. It was hypothesized that egg size variation could play an important role in survival of newly hatched ducklings during their first few days out of the nest when they are most susceptible to thermal stress and starvation. Precocial young must be physiologically capable of maintaining homeothermy in order to spend adequate time foraging. Duckling size at hatching was highly correlated with egg mass, and those hatching from heavier eggs were able to maintain homeothermy at colder environmental temperatures than those from lighter eggs. Heavy ducklings had significantly lower mass-specific cooling rates, but lower critical temperature did not vary significantly among ducklings of different size. Although insulation and energy reserves were not proportionally greater in larger ducklings, those hatching from heavier eggs can survive starvation longer than those from lighter eggs. The relative cold tolerance of young from light and heavy eggs will affect the ratio of time spent foraging to time spent being brooded by the female parent. Although there is no direct evidence that selection is acting on egg size, variation in this trait within a population could be maintained by fluctuating environmental conditions at hatch.
1145	3411632	Embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of selenium in the diet of mallards.	Hoffman DJ, Heinz GH	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1988;24(4):477-90	 doi: 101080/15287398809531178	Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed a control diet, diets containing 1, 5, 10, or 25 ppm Se as sodium selenite, or a diet containing 10 ppm Se as seleno-DL-methionine in the first of two experiments. Selenium at 10 ppm as selenomethionine or 25 ppm as sodium selenite caused a 40-44% decrease in the total number of eggs that hatched compared to controls. Selenium at 25 ppm (sodium selenite) resulted in a 19% decrease in mean embryonic weight at 18 d of incubation, accompanied by a 6% decrease in crown-rump length. Ten parts per million Se as selenomethionine was more teratogenic than sodium selenite at 25 ppm. Selenomethionine (10 ppm Se) resulted in an incidence of 13.1% malformations that were often multiple, whereas sodium selenite (10 and 25 ppm Se) resulted in 3.6 and 4.2% malformations. The teratogenicity of selenomethionine was confirmed in a second experiment in which mallards received 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 ppm Se as selenomethionine, resulting in 0.9, 0.5, 1.4, 6.8, and 67.9% malformations, respectively. These malformations included hydrocephaly, microphthalmia, lower bill defects, and foot defects with ectrodactyly. Both forms of selenium increased the incidence of edema and stunted embryonic growth. Selenomethionine (10 ppm Se) resulted in a significant increase of approximately 40% in plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and a 70% increase in sorbitol dehydrogenase activity (indicative of hepatotoxicity) in hatchlings. Sodium selenite (25 ppm Se) resulted in fourfold elevation in plasma uric acid concentration, indicative of renal alteration. Selenomethionine accumulated much better in eggs than did sodium selenite. These findings indicate that selenomethionine is considerably more teratogenic and generally more embryotoxic than sodium selenite, probably due to higher uptake of selenomethionine.
1146	3382368	Characterization of an avian cholera epizootic in wild birds in western Nebraska.	Windingstad RM, Kerr SM, Duncan RM, Brand CJ	Avian Dis	 1988 Jan-Mar;32(1):124-31		Avian cholera killed an estimated 2500 birds in western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming from 28 November 1985 to late January 1986. Wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) suffered the most losses. Other wild waterfowl, wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), a few domestic fowl, and a bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) also died. Pasteurella multocida serotype 1 was the predominant isolate from these carcasses. Cold, wet weather persisted throughout the outbreak, but daily losses in the flock of 50,000 mallards using the area were low. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from nasal swabs of 35 of 37 cattle from a feedlot in which many of these mallards were feeding. Eighty percent of the cattle isolates had antigenic characteristics of serotype 3 or serotype 3 with cross-reactivity. Isolates from wild mallards, wild turkeys, and the bald eagle were virulent to game-farm mallards when inoculated subcutaneously, but P. multocida isolates from cattle were not.
1147	3378202	Migratory birds of central Washington as reservoirs of Campylobacter jejuni.	Pacha RE, Clark GW, Williams EA, Carter AM	Can J Microbiol	 1988 Jan;34(1):80-2	 doi: 101139/m88-015	Migratory ducks, Canada geese, and sandhill crane from the Pacific North American Flyway have been screened for Campylobacter spp. Samples (298) from these birds were examined and the incidence of Campylobacter spp. in the samples were as follows: sandhill crane (Grus canadensis tabida), 81%; ducks (Aythya collaris, Anas carolinensis, Aythya americana, and Anas platyrhynchos), 73%; and Canada geese (Branta canadensis), 5%. All isolates were identified as Campylobacter jejuni. To our knowledge this is the first report of the isolation of C. jejuni from sandhill crane. The high frequency of isolation in both the sandhill crane and migratory ducks indicated that these bird populations may play a significant role in the dissemination of the bacterium. Because of their migratory habits, these birds may be particularly important in spreading C. jejuni to remote areas.
1148	3352095	Toxic effects of natural saline waters on mallard ducklings.	Mitcham SA, Wobeser G	J Wildl Dis	 1988 Jan;24(1):45-50	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-24145	Water from 10 saline wetlands in Saskatchewan was provided as drinking water for 1-day-old mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Ducklings given water with conductivity from 3,750 to 7,490 microns hos/cm grew as well as birds on fresh water during a 14-day trial, but birds given water with conductivity of 4,000 microns hos/cm grew poorly during the last 2 wk of a 28-day trial. Ducklings given water with conductivity of 7,720 micron hos/cm grew poorly during a 14-day trial. Six of 10 ducklings given water with conductivity of 20,000 microns hos/cm died, and only two of nine ducklings given water with conductivity of 21,500 microns hos/cm survived 14 days. Survivors were much smaller than controls and had many abnormalities. All ducklings given water with conductivity of 35,000 and 67,000 microns hos/cm died within 60 and 30 hr, respectively. The results indicate that ducklings hatched on many saline wetlands will suffer toxic effects unless they are able to find a source of fresh water shortly after hatching.
1149	3352094	Effects of sodium and magnesium sulfate in drinking water on mallard ducklings.	Mitcham SA, Wobeser G	J Wildl Dis	 1988 Jan;24(1):30-44	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-24130	One-day-old mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings were given drinking water for up to 28 days that contained concentrations of sodium and/or magnesium similar to those found in saline wetlands. Growth, tissue development, and biochemical characteristics of these ducklings were compared to those reared on fresh water. Much of the ingested salt was excreted by passage of voluminous fluid excreta. This effect occurred in birds given water with as little as 500 ppm Mg or 1,000 ppm Na. The supraorbital salt gland was active within 4 days in ducklings drinking water containing greater than or equal to 1,500 ppm of Na. Feather growth was decreased in ducklings drinking water with greater than or equal to 1,500 ppm of either Na or Mg. Ducklings drinking water with 3,000 ppm of either ion, or 1,500 ppm of each, grew more slowly than control birds. Ducklings drinking water with 3,000 ppm of either Na or Mg had reduced thymus size and bone breaking strength. Those drinking water with 3,000 ppm of Mg, or 3,100 ppm Na and 1,300 ppm Mg also had less trabecular bone and enlarged adrenals. Birds drinking the latter water had an elevated concentration of Na and calcium, and a decreased concentration of phosphorus and chloride in their serum, and elevated plasma protein levels. Ducklings reared on fresh or slightly saline water adapted very poorly to an abrupt change to more saline water (specific conductivity = 15,250 microns hos/cm) at 14 days of age. These birds stopped eating, became inactive and some died within 3 days; survivors had many tissue and biochemical abnormalities at 20 days of age. The level of salinity in these trials was similar to that in "brackish" or "moderately saline" wetlands and lower than that previously found to have effects on growth and feathering of ducklings. Many of the sublethal effects were subtle and non-specific manifestations of stress, and would be difficult to detect in wild ducklings on saline wetlands.
1150	2906834	Effects of short-term changes in electrolyte intake on the adrenal steroidogenic responses of juvenile mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Redondo JL, Holmes WN, Cronshaw J	Comp Biochem Physiol A Comp Physiol	 1988;91(3):513-8	 doi: 101016/0300-9629(88)90627-5	1. Adjusting the Na+ and K+ intake of juvenile mallard ducks caused the plasma concentrations of corticosterone (B) and aldosterone (Aldo) to increase independently of one another, but none of these changes in electrolyte intake had a significant effect on the deoxycorticosterone (DOC) concentration. 2. With the exception of DOC in birds consuming the control diet, the plasma concentration of each hormone, regardless of diet, increased significantly following exposure to stress. 3. Stress-induced increases in Aldo concentration were greatest in birds given diets containing low concentrations of Na+. 4. Unlike the mammal and some other species of birds, Na+ may be the primary secretagogue responsible for the regulation of both corticosterone and aldosterone synthesis in the mallard duck.
1151	2964117	Cryptosporidium infections in birds and mammals and attempted cross-transmission studies.	O'Donoghue PJ, Tham VL, de Saram WG, Paull KL, McDermott S	Vet Parasitol	 1987 Dec;26(1-2):1-11	 doi: 101016/0304-4017(87)90071-9	Infections by Cryptosporidium were detected in association with clinical disease in 11 humans (Homo sapiens), 19 calves (Bos taurus), nine common quail (Coturnix coturnix), six mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), five ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and a single budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). Infections in mammals were accompanied by transient diarrhoea and anorexia, whereas infected birds exhibited clinical signs of respiratory distress. Repeated cross-transmission studies revealed apparent strain differences or differences in the host specificity of several mammalian and avian isolates for homologous vertebrate classes only. Oocysts from humans and calves were infective to mice, pigs or lambs, but not to chickens, whereas oocysts from quail and pheasant were infective to chickens, but not to mice.
1152	3691965	Alarm call responsivity of mallard ducklings: V. Age-related changes in repetition rate specificity and behavioral inhibition.	Miller DB, Blaich CF	Dev Psychobiol	 1987 Nov;20(6):571-86	 doi: 101002/dev420200603	Twenty-four-hour-old mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) exhibit a high degree of behavioral freezing (i.e., vocal and locomotor inhibition) upon hearing the maternal alarm call, which the hen utters when potential predators are near the nest. In this study, we assessed age-related changes in alarm call responsivity between 12 and 72 hr after hatching. Experiment 1 revealed that, although a significant reduction in vocal activity occurred upon exposure to the alarm call at all ages tested (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 hr), birds older than 48 hr exhibited lower levels of freezing than younger birds. Furthermore, 12-hr-old ducklings exhibited the greatest level of freezing among the younger-aged groups. In Experiment 2, 12-, and 72-hr-old ducklings were tested to variations of the alarm call that differed in repetition rate (0.2 to 2.6 notes/sec, in increments of 2/10 of a second) to ascertain whether there are age-related changes in perceptual specificity and whether ducklings exhibit perceptual sharpening. Although older ducklings exhibited a slight shift in perceptual specificity toward faster repetition rates, they froze significantly less than younger ducklings at all repetition rates. Therefore, there was no evidence of perceptual sharpening. These data suggest that alarm call responsivity may represent an adaptation that appears to be associated with the timing of the nest exodus.
1153	3451744	Bile immunoglobulin of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). II. Antibody response in influenza A virus infections.	Higgins DA, Shortridge KF, Ng PL	Immunology	 1987 Nov;62(3):499-504		The capacity of the IgM-like bile immunoglobulin (IgX) of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) to express antibody activity to H3N2 influenza A viruses, and the dependence of this activity on the co-existence of serum IgM antibodies were investigated. Ducklings infected orally and intranasally at 15-29 days of age with viruses isolated from different host species were examined for haemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies in biles and sera 16-29 days after infection (p.i.). All biles had antibodies associated with IgX; all sera had antibodies associated only with the 7.8S IgG. Following oral infection of birds 42-days-old with influenza A/duck/HK/7/75 virus, serum HI antibodies were an initial IgM response occurring from 5-12 days p.i., followed by the appearance of 7.8S IgG antibodies. Virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies in serum were also biphasic; isotype classification was not attempted. Bile IgX developed HI and VN activity. HI antibodies reached peak titres 12 days p.i. and fell to low levels by 24 days p.i. VN antibodies also reached peak titres 12 days p.i., but thereafter persisted at quite high levels throughout the experiment. Development of high titres of antibody in bile coincided with the termination of virus excretion in faeces. These experiments confirm that bile IgX of the duck can function as antibody in response to influenza A viruses, and that its activity appears to be independent of serum IgM. Its possible relevance in determining survival of virus in the intestine is discussed.

1155	3694117	Habituation of the cardiac response to involuntary diving in diving and dabbling ducks.	Gabbott GR, Jones DR	J Exp Biol	 1987 Sep;131:403-15	 doi: 101242/jeb1311403	1. Bradycardia in response to forced submergence was habituated in dabbling (Anas platyrhynchos, Linnaeus) and diving (Aythya americana, Eyton) ducks by repetitively submerging the animals, each day for several days, for periods of 40 and 20 s, respectively. The onset of pronounced bradycardia was delayed with each successive trial, until little or no bradycardia occurred during submergence. Diving bradycardia is driven by chemoreceptors in the dabbler and caused by stimulation of narial receptors in the diver. 2. Mean arterial blood pressure in dives was unchanged from pre-dive levels in both naive and trained dabbling ducks. PaO2, PaCO2 and pHa at the end of a dive were similar before and after habituation training. 3. Bradycardia occurred in dives by habituated dabbling ducks if the animal breathed 15% O2 before submergence. The ventilatory responses to breathing high and low levels of oxygen were unaffected by habituation training. 4. The changes in blood gases during dives by naive and habituated dabbling ducks were the same: therefore, in the absence of a demonstrated decrement in receptor chemosensitivity or efferent potency, the locus of habituation must reside in the central nervous system.
1156	3666683	External stimuli affecting incubation behavior and prolactin secretion in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Hall MR	Horm Behav	 1987 Sep;21(3):269-87	 doi: 101016/0018-506x(87)90015-8	The importance of general environmental, including visual and tactile, stimuli on behavior and prolactin secretion during the incubation phase of reproduction in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was investigated. Nest occupancy rapidly increased at the end of egg laying and marked the initiation of incubation. Two recesses from the nest each day were synchronized to dawn and dusk; the median occurrence was 0.23 hr after dawn and 1.17 hr before dusk. Mean recess length was 36.1 +/- 1.9 min at dawn and 40.5 +/- 2.1 min at dusk. Plasma prolactin concentrations during incubation, 25.8 +/- 2.3 ng/ml, decreased to baseline levels, 10.8 +/- 1.9 ng/ml, within 24 hr after nestbox removal. The withdrawal of tactile, but not visual, stimuli of the clutch during incubation by either anesthesia or denervation of the incubation patch caused significant decreases in prolactin plasma concentrations within 24 hr. Prolactin plasma concentrations decreased rapidly at the end of incubation in ducks which successfully hatched young as well as in unsuccessful incubators. Temperature manipulations of the clutch, either above or below normal, caused decreases in plasma prolactin concentrations in parallel with temperature modification.
1157	2961429	Adrenergic and osmotic responses to atrial natriuretic peptide and angiotensin II in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wilson JX	Can J Physiol Pharmacol	 1987 Sep;65(9):1995-9	 doi: 101139/y87-311	There is evidence that analogues of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and angiotensin II (ANG II) occur in birds. The present experiments studied the adrenergic and osmoregulatory responses to synthetic ANP and ANG II in salt-loaded ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Excretion of water and salt through the nasal salt glands was abolished by ANG II. This extrarenal, salt-retaining effect of ANG II was not altered by ANP. However, ANP did augment the diuretic response to ANG II. ANP also potentiated the stimulatory effect of ANG II on plasma norepinephrine. The data are consistent with physiological roles for native analogues of ANP and ANG II in adrenergic and osmotic regulation in the duck.
1158	3618829	Dehydration and arginine vasotocin and angiotensin II in CSF and plasma of pekin ducks.	Gray DA, Simon E	Am J Physiol	 1987 Aug;253(2 Pt 2):R285-91	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19872532R285	Osmolalities and, by radioimmunoassay, the contents of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and angiotensin II (ANG II) in simultaneously collected cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were determined in chronically prepared conscious Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) adapted to either freshwater (FW ducks) or salt water (2% saline, SW ducks) for drinking. In FW ducks the AVT in CSF was approximately 10-fold higher than in plasma; ANG II concentration in CSF was about two-thirds of that in plasma. In SW ducks concentrations of AVT were increased approximately threefold and of ANG II fourfold in both CSF and plasma. Dehydration in FW ducks (24-48 h) increased AVT and ANG II in both CSF and plasma, the relative rise being greater in plasma. Within 150 min after rehydration plasma AVT fell at unchanged CSF AVT, whereas CSF ANG II fell at unchanged plasma ANG II. Hydration of SW ducks with freshwater had similar effects. The results indicate separate avenues of release of central and systemic AVT and ANG II and support the idea of an independent control of central ANG II as a mediator in osmoregulation, with CSF AVT reflecting the state of osmoregulatory activity of the hypothalamopituitary vasotocinergic system.
1159	2442066	Reevaluation of the effect of substance P on nasal salt gland secretion in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wilson JX	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1987 Aug;67(2):256-62	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(87)90155-9	Adrenergic and osmoregulatory responses to substance P (SP) were studied in salt-loaded ducks. SP inhibited nasal salt secretion by decreasing the salt concentration of the nasal fluid, but reversed the inhibitory effect of angiotensin II (ANG II) on nasal water and K secretion. SP also stimulated salivation, urinary water excretion, and urinary salt excretion, but diminished the diuretic and saluretic responses to ANG II. The osmoregulatory effects of SP were accompanied by elevated plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine. The data suggest that SP may contribute to adrenergic and osmotic regulation in ducks.
1160	3625910	A solitary case of duck plague in a wild mallard.	Wobeser G, Docherty DE	J Wildl Dis	 1987 Jul;23(3):479-82	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-233479	Duck plague was diagnosed on the basis of pathology and virus isolation in a wild female mallard Anas platyrhynchos found dead near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Day-old Pekin ducklings and one of two adult mallards died with lesions typical of duck plague following inoculation of tissue from the wild bird. This is believed to be the only reported case of duck plague in a wild bird since a major outbreak occurred in South Dakota in 1973, and the fourth such report in North America.
1161	3625892	Experimental duck plague in blue-winged teal and Canada geese.	Wobeser G	J Wildl Dis	 1987 Jul;23(3):368-75	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-233368	Ten adult blue-winged teal (Anas discors) and six Canada goose (Branta canadensis) goslings were inoculated with liver tissue from a natural case of duck plague in a wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Four additional teal were placed in contact with the inoculated ducks. Inoculated teal died 63.5-68 hr after inoculation; two of the contact teal died 161-162 hr after exposure. Three of the goslings died 119-133 hr after inoculation, the others were killed when moribund 90-133 hr postinfection. The clinical course of disease was extremely rapid in both species. Signs were limited to sudden onset of profound weakness, ataxia, tremors and terminal convulsions. The only consistent gross lesion in the teal was a small dark spleen; half the teal also had inconspicuous foci of epithelial necrosis in the distal esophagus and in the cloaca. Goslings had more severe lesions, with focal hepatic necrosis visible in all, and mucosal necrosis over the intestinal lymphoid tissue, and intestinal hemorrhage in three birds each. Microscopic lesions in both species were similar to those reported in mallards. Duck plague might be overlooked at necropsy of blue-winged teal, because of the paucity of gross lesions.
1162	3040252	The duct system of the avian salt gland as a transporting epithelium: structure and morphometry in the duck Anas platyrhynchos.	Marshall AT, King P, Condron RJ, Phillips JG	Cell Tissue Res	 1987 Jul;249(1):179-88	 doi: 101007/BF00215432	The duct system of the nasal salt gland of the duck comprises central central canals, secondary ducts and main ducts. The secondary and main ducts consist of a layer of columnar cells overlying a layer of small cuboidal cells. The columnar cells have complex intercellular spaces showing evidence of Na+K+-ATPase at the apical regions. Approximately 70% of surface area of the duct system is external to the gland. During adaptation to salt water the duct system increases in size as does the gland. Although the components of the gland of adapted ducks, including the duct system within the gland, increase in size compared with normal ducks, the percentage volume densities of the components remain similar in both categories of ducks, i.e. the duct system increases in size in proportion to the glandular tissue. The volume of the duct system external to the gland is six to seven times larger than the volume within the gland. Thus, if ductal modification of secreted fluid occurs, it will be most likely to take place in the ducts external to the gland. Total surface areas of the duct system were measured from serial sections of glands and ducts from one normal and one adapted duck. These were used to calculate possible flux rates of water and sodium across the duct epithelium, assuming the occurrence of either water reabsorption of sodium secretion. Although these flux rates are high it is shown that they are similar to calculated flux rates across the luminal surface of the secretory tubules.
1163	2888829	Plasma growth hormone, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon inter-relationships during infusion of human pancreatic growth hormone-releasing factor in young and adult ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Foltzer-Jourdainne C, Harvey S, Karmann H, Mialhe P	J Endocrinol	 1987 Jul;114(1):25-32	 doi: 101677/joe01140025	Human pancreatic GH-releasing factor (hpGRF) increased the concentrations of plasma GH when infused i.v. into immature ducks. A dose-dependent increase in plasma GH was observed within 10 min of the start of infusion and was maintained during the 30-min infusion period. Simultaneous infusion of somatostatin S-14 prevented the increase in plasma GH induced by hpGRF, but when the infusion had finished there was a rebound increase in plasma GH. Infusion of the highest dose of hpGRF (800 ng/kg per min) in adult ducks had no significant effect on plasma GH. Plasma somatostatin concentrations were reduced during the infusion of hpGRF in young but not in adult ducks. This observation suggests that the stimulatory effect of hpGRF on GH secretion may be partly due to its inhibitory effect on somatostatin secretion. Infusion of hpGRF in ducklings also increased the concentrations of glucagon and decreased levels of insulin in the plasma. Peripheral plasma glucagon and insulin levels in adult ducks were unaffected by hpGRF infusion. These results indicate that in ducklings, hpGRF increases plasma GH and glucagon concentrations and lowers plasma somatostatin and insulin levels. In the adult, these hormonal responses to hpGRF are not maintained. The highly stimulatory effect of hpGRF on GH secretion in ducklings may explain why plasma GH concentrations are high in these birds.
1164	3618525	Posthatching development of the rete ophthalmicum in relation to brain temperature of mallard ducks (anas platyrhynchos).	Arad Z, Midtgard U, Bernstein MH	Am J Anat	 1987 Jun;179(2):137-42	 doi: 101002/aja1001790206	In posthatching mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), brain cooling improves with growth. To determine whether this may be correlated with growth-related changes in morphology of the rete ophthalmicum, we studied the development of this rete in immature mallards from hatching to 29 days of age. We found that the number of arteries and veins was fixed at hatching. The rete continued to grow, however, in length and vessel diameter during body and brain growth. The vascular surface area for heat exchange in the rete therefore also increased with body and brain mass. The increase in retial heat-exchange area was faster than the simultaneous increase in brain mass. The increase in body-to-brain temperature difference (delta T) described previously occurred nearly in direct proportion to heat-exchange area, such that the ratio of delta T to exchange area was nearly constant at about 0.1 degrees C per mm2 during growth. It is concluded that the increase in heat-exchange area of the rete ophthalmicum plays a major role in the development of brain cooling capacity of posthatching ducks.
1165	3591985	Adrenal gland denervation and diving in ducks.	Mangalam HJ, Jones DR, Lacombe AM	Am J Physiol	 1987 Jun;252(6 Pt 2):R1143-51	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19872526R1143	The extreme elevation in plasma levels of free norepinephrine (NE) and free epinephrine (EP), which occurs during forced diving of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), was studied before and after denervation of the adrenal glands. In intact animals both NE and EP concentration increased by up to two orders of magnitude in a 4-min dive but by a significantly lesser amount if the duck breathed O2 before the dive. Denervating the adrenal glands reduced the amounts of both catecholamines (CA) released during dives, plasma EP decreased to 10%, and NE to 50% of values obtained before denervation. Breathing O2 before a dive virtually eliminated CA release in denervates, indicating that hypoxia was the important non-neural releasing agent. Hypoxia was also the most important neural releasing agent compared with hypercapnia, acidosis, or hypoglycemia. Adrenal denervation did not cause significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, arterial blood gas tensions, pH, or plasma glucose during dives, although denervation caused increased variation in some of these variables. In ducks CA release in dives is largely due to decreasing arterial O2 partial pressure, and full expression of the response is dependent on intact innervation of the adrenal gland.
1166	3582734	Sexually dimorphic and laterally asymmetric development of the embryonic duck syrinx: effect of estrogen on in vitro cell proliferation and chondrogenesis.	Takahashi MM, Noumura T	Dev Biol	 1987 Jun;121(2):417-22	 doi: 101016/0012-1606(87)90178-3	The syrinx, the vocal organ in birds, shows sexual dimorphism in the duck, Anas platyrhynchos. At the cellular level, to examine the role of estrogen in sexually dimorphic and laterally asymmetric development of duck syrinx, cells dissociated from the right and left halves of sexually monomorphic and primitive masculine syrinxes from 10 2/3-day embryos of male and female ducks were cultured by the micromass culture method, with or without estrogen. In the absence of estrogen, primary cell cultures from either side of male syrinx revealed identical abilities in both cell proliferation and chondrogenesis. In the female cell cultures, the right- and left-side cells proliferated equally but the right-side cells accumulated a larger amount of sulfated proteoglycans than the left-side cells did. Both proliferation and chondrogenesis in the male cell cultures were more active than those in the female cell cultures. Estradiol inhibited significantly cell proliferation as well as chondrogenesis in cell cultures from either side of female syrinx. Cultures from right-side cells of male syrinx were less inhibited by estradiol in cell proliferation and especially in chondrogenesis than the other three cultures. Generally, in both sexes the left-side cells of syrinx were more responsive to estrogen than the right-side cells in diminishing proliferation and chondrogenesis. The present results suggest that estrogen inhibits both cell proliferation and chondrogenesis in the female syrinx and that this process may contribute to the development of sexual dimorphism in the duck syrinx.
1167	3598400	Diesters of 3-hydroxy fatty acids produced by the uropygial glands of female mallards uniquely during the mating season.	Kolattukudy PE, Bohnet S, Rogers L	J Lipid Res	 1987 May;28(5):582-8		The uropygial gland secretions produced by female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) throughout the year were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and combined gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Most of the year, the secretion was composed of wax esters. With the beginning of the mating season in the middle of March, a polar component appeared which became the dominant and sole component of the secretion through April and May and as the mating season ended in June, wax esters became the sole component of the secretion. The polar components were identified to be diesters of n-C8, n-C10, and n-C12 3-hydroxy acids with n-C16 and n-C18 alcohols and n-C6 to C16 even chain acids. Immediately after the diester-producing period the female uropygial glands produced very long chain wax esters composed of fatty acids longer than C12. By the end of August, shorter chain wax esters composed of C6 and C12 acids became the dominant components of the secretion and this composition, previously considered characteristic of mallards, remained constant until March. The observed disappearance of the short chain waxes during the postnuptial period is similar to that in males. The dramatic changes in the composition of the uropygial glands similar to those observed in the female mallards during the mating season have not yet been observed in any other species.
1168	3582949	Adrenalectomy fails to block salt gland secretion in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) adapted to 0.9% saline drinking water.	Butler DG	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1987 May;66(2):171-81	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(87)90265-6	Salt-adapted Pekin ducks were observed during a 2-week period following adrenalectomy so as to test the hypothesis that NaCl secretion by the nasal salt glands depends on adrenocortical steroids. Three days after adrenalectomy the total inputs of fluid and Na+ during a 90-min iv infusion of 1000 mOsm/kg NaCl were 77 and 80% respectively, of those in the sham-operated controls; 7 days after adrenalectomy they were 88 and 90%. Two weeks after adrenalectomy, cardiovascular function had deteriorated slightly and the total outputs of fluid and Na+ had fallen to 65 and 64%, respectively, of the control outputs. The onset of cardiovascular deterioration was delayed by feeding the ducks 0.9% NaCl drinking water ad libitum for 1 month before, and 2 weeks after, adrenalectomy. Adaptive hypertrophy of the nasal salt glands was not steroid-dependent since there was no measurable decrease in the weight of the glands during a 2-week period following adrenalectomy.
1169	3110891	Effects of H+ versus CO2 on ventilation in the Pekin duck.	Dodd GA, Milsom WK	Respir Physiol	 1987 May;68(2):189-201	 doi: 101016/s0034-5687(87)80005-1	Measurements were made of ventilation (VE) and arterial blood gases (PCO2 and PO2) and pH in awake Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, exposed to sequential cycles of 1% step changes in inspired CO2 from 0 to 5 and back to 0% CO2, as well as to a sustained period (5 h) of 5% CO2 breathing. Changing the background level of inspired PO2 was used to alter the range of PaCO2 over which CO2 response curves were obtained. The initial increase in minute ventilation following a sustained step increase in inspired CO2 (5%) began to decline immediately at a rate of approximately 1% every 5 min. This was closely paralleled by increases in both pH and [HCO-3] while arterial PaCO2 remained constant or increased slightly. CO2 response curves (VE vs PaCO2) generated in a sequential fashion shifted down and to the right (a paradoxical decrease in VE associated with an increase in PaCO2) while the relationship between VE and pH remained constant. These data suggest that VE is a single function of pH in birds under these conditions and that the relationship between VE and PaCO2 is altered due to metabolic acid-base compensation even during acute CO2 exposure.
1170	2441315	The organization of the nucleus basalis-neostriatum complex of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.) and its connections with the archistriatum and the paleostriatum complex.	Dubbeldam JL, Visser AM	Neuroscience	 1987 May;21(2):487-517	 doi: 101016/0306-4522(87)90137-0	The pattern of connections between the nucleus basalis, neostriatum, hyperstriatum ventrale, paleostriatum complex and archistriatum in the mallard has been analysed using Nissl material and a combination of neuroanatomical tracing procedures (autoradiography, horseradish peroxidase and horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin histochemistry, lesion/degeneration technique). The frontal part of the mallard's telencephalon is characterized by its multilayered organization and the predominantly vertical arrangement of the connecting fiber systems. The nucleus basalis, endstation of the ascending sensory trigeminal system, is a large laminar cell area with a dorsal and a ventral layer. The overlying neostriatum frontale can be subdivided into a medial, a dorsal and a ventral intermediate, and a lateral area. The nucleus basalis has distinct connections with the ventral layer and sparse connections with the dorsal layer of the intermediate neostriatum, and abundant reciprocal connections with the ventral layer of the hyperstriatum ventrale. The ventral intermediate neostriatum also has reciprocal connections with the hyperstriatum ventrale; its projections overlap partly with those from the nucleus basalis. The ventral layer of the intermediate neostriatum frontale has a distinct projection upon the paleostriatum augmentatum. The dorsal layer sends fibers to the lateral neostriatum, to the rostral "sensorimotor" part of the archistriatum and to the lateral zone of the lobus parolfactorius. Another source of archistriatal afferents is the paleostriatum ventrale, an area that may also send fibers to the brainstem. Figure 21 summarizes the connections described in this paper. The functional significance of this organization is discussed in relation to its possible role in the guidance of pecking and other feeding behaviors in the mallard. Differences in the organization of the systems in pigeon and mallard are related to the differing degrees of visual and tactile (trigeminal) contributions to feeding in the two birds. It is suggested that the pattern of reciprocal connections between the hyperstriatum ventrale and the nucleus basalis and ventral intermediate neostriatum frontale forms the neuroanatomical substrate for a "comparator-system".

Wobeser G, Blakley BR	J Wildl Dis	 1987 Apr;23(2):341-3	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-232341	Strychnine poisoning was diagnosed in free-flying mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and a ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) found dead on a pond in a zoo. The probable source of toxin was improperly applied strychnine-treated grain used for control of rodents on adjacent farm land. Ingesta of the birds contained 19.7-85.1 mg/kg of strychnine.
1172	3569179	Mercury accumulation in mallards fed methylmercury with or without added DDE.	Heinz GH	Environ Res	 1987 Apr;42(2):372-6	 doi: 101016/s0013-9351(87)80203-7	Adult female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed a control diet or diets containing 1 ppm methylmercury chloride, 5 ppm methylmercury chloride, 1 ppm methylmercury chloride plus 5 ppm DDE, or 5 ppm methylmercury chloride plus 5 ppm DDE. The presence of DDE in the diet did not affect retention of mercury in breast muscle or eggs. There was a good correlation between the levels of mercury in the breast muscle of females and their eggs, and this correlation was unaffected by the presence of DDE in the diet. This correlation suggests that one could predict mercury levels in female mallards in the field when only eggs have been collected and vice versa.
1173	3035244	An unusual pleomorphic sarcoma in a hybrid mallard.	Roffe TJ	J Wildl Dis	 1987 Apr;23(2):334-7	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-232334	An unusual pleomorphic sarcoma from a hybrid mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is described. Rhabdomyosarcoma was considered in the original differential diagnoses but rejected due to lack of specific characteristics generally seen in these tumors. The histologic characteristics described are consistent with mammalian sarcomas recorded in the literature as malignant fibrous histiocytoma.
1174	2884271	Pancreatic somatostatin, glucagon and insulin during post-hatch growth in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Foltzer C, Harvey S, Mialhe P	J Endocrinol	 1987 Apr;113(1):65-70	 doi: 101677/joe01130065	Pancreatic somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI), immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) were measured during growth in ducks. The content of each hormone increased progressively but at different rates in the dorsal, ventral and splenic lobes of the pancreas. In the almost fully grown duck, the splenic lobe contained 80 and 63% of the total content of GLI and SLI respectively but low levels of IRI (23%), which were highest in the dorsal lobe (53%). In contrast to the hormonal content, only total GLI concentrations increased during development, the SLI concentrations remaining stable and IRI concentrations declining during growth. Gel filtration of pancreatic extracts indicated that most of the SLI in the pancreas of young and adult birds was somatostatin-14, although somatostatin-28 was present in the ventral lobe of young birds and larger molecular forms were present in the ventral and dorsal lobes. These changes in pancreatic hormonal content and concentration are dissimilar to age-related changes in SLI, GLI and IRI previously observed in the plasma of ducks. Plasma levels of pancreatic hormones may thus be controlled by hormonal and/or neutral factors during post-hatch growth.
1175	3101522	Acid-base balance in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) during involuntary submergence.	Shimizu M, Jones DR	Am J Physiol	 1987 Feb;252(2 Pt 2):R348-52	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19872522R348	Measurements of all the major independent variables [arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2); strong-ion difference ([SID]), and total protein content, which approximate total weak acid concentration in plasma] are essential for understanding changes in acid-base balance in plasma. During involuntary submergence of 1, 2, or 4 min, PaCO2 in ducks increased and arterial pH (pHa) decreased. During 1-min dives there were no significant changes in any strong ions. In both 2- and 4-min dives, there was a significant increase in [lactate-], but because of an increase in equal magnitude of [Na+], [SID] did not change. During recovery from all dives the plasma remained acidotic for several minutes, although PaCO2 fell below predive levels in less than 1 min. [Lactate-] increased in the recovery period. There were no changes in total protein content during submergence or recovery. Breathing 100% O2 before 2-min dives caused a reduction in [lactate-] production and release during and after the dive, although due to a marked increased in PaCO2, pHa fell as low as in 4-min dives after breathing air. After 1 min of recovery, pHa returned to normal along with the restoration of the predive level of PaCO2. We conclude that the acidosis during involuntary submergence is due solely to an increase in PaCO2, whereas in recovery it is caused by decreased [SID].
1176	18766636	An unusual intracellular infection in ducks.	Randall CJ, Lees S, Pepin GA, Ross HM	Avian Pathol	 1987;16(3):479-91	 doi: 101080/03079458708436397	An infection causing mortality was encountered on seven occasions in Muscovy (Cairina moschata) and domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). In all cases the principal lesion was a severe pneumonitis associated with the presence of numerous organisms in the cytoplasm of the blood capillary endothelial cells. Cultural examination for bacterial and fungal agents consistently failed to yield significant isolates. In tissue sections the organisms were poorly stained by haematoxylin and eosin but were strongly positive to the periodic acid-Schiff and periodic acid-silver methenamine methods. Electron microscopy showed round (0.5 microm to 1.0 microm diameter) or oval (1 microm x 1.7 microm) forms possessing a complex cell wall, cytoplasmic lamellar bodies and an apparently membrane-bound nuclear structure. On the available evidence, the identity of the organism and its classification as either a prokaryote or eukaryote were not resolved.
1177	15092704	Investigation into the effects of ingestion of zinc shot by Mallard Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	French MC, Haines CW, Cooper J	Environ Pollut	 1987;47(4):305-14	 doi: 101016/0269-7491(87)90150-3	Lead fishing weights and gun shot have been identified as a widespread cause of poisoning of swans and other wildfowl (order Anseriformes). As part of the efforts to find environmentally acceptable substitutes for lead, this paper describes the results obtained from a trial which involved the feeding of zinc shot to groups of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Observations of the mallard during the experimental period, post mortem examination, histo-pathological examination and also chemical analysis of liver, kidney and feathers, revealed no ill effects to the dosed birds and indicated that zinc metal in shot from probably presents no detectable health threat to wild birds if ingested.
1178	3547533	Deposition and phagocytosis of inhaled particles in the gas exchange region of the duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Stearns RC, Barnas GM, Walski M, Brain JD	Respir Physiol	 1987 Jan;67(1):23-36	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(87)90004-1	Little is known about the fate of inhaled aerosol particles in birds; even the anatomical location of phagocytic cells within the lungs has yet to be clearly demonstrated. We exposed 2 anesthetized, spontaneously breathing ducks to a non-toxic iron oxide aerosol (aerodynamic mass mean diameter = 0.18 micron; 460 mg/m3) for 1.75 h and 2 awake, resting ducks to less concentrated aerosol (38 mg/m3) for 6 h on two consecutive days. All 4 ducks were sacrificed 24 h after the end of the last exposure. Their lungs, as well as the lungs from a control duck not exposed to the aerosol, were fixed in situ by insufflation of osmium tetroxide vapor or by intravascular perfusion. Then samples of the gas exchange region were examined with a transmission electron microscope. We found iron oxide particles: trapped within the trilaminar substance that is unique to avian lungs and coats the atria and infundibula; within epithelial cells of the atria and initial portions of the infundibula; and within interstitial macrophages. Only occasionally, small amounts of particles were found in the air capillaries. We conclude that both epithelial cells and interstitial macrophages can phagocytize particles in avian lungs, and that there is some convective transport of aerosol to the atria and the initial portions of the infundibula.
1179	3331054	Avian cranio-cervical systems. Part II: Arthrology of the occipito-cervical system in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Weisgram J, Zweers GA	Acta Morphol Neerl Scand	 1987;25(3):157-66		The arthrology of the muscle-bone apparatus of the occipito-cervical system in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.) was analysed by dissection and from histological microsections of an in toto embedded occipito-atlanto-axial apparatus. The description is primarily concerned with ligaments, membranes and fibrocartilages which were so far incompletely analysed. Several newly described elements such as the ligamentum atlantooccipitale laterale and the ligamentum ventromediale atlantoaxiale were added, as well as additional aspects such as the accurately described attachments, course and shape of most of the studied elements.
1180	3105213	3 beta-Hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenases of the testis and epididymis of the Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos L.)	Tetzlaff G	Acta Histochem	 1987;81(1):19-34		This study is concerned with the histochemical activity of hydrosteroid dehydrogenases (HSD), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) in testis and epididymis of 20 male Pekin ducks. Various 3 beta-HSD, the G6PDH, and the 6PGDH were localized in these organs. 3 beta-etiocholane was much quicker utilized by the 3 beta-HSD than epiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstendiol. The capability of testis Leydig cells of utilizing the 3 beta-etiocholane was higher in winter than in summer. The G6PDH and the 6PGDH in the Leydig cells and basal cell layer of the tubuli seminiferi contorti were active throughout the year. There was weak 3 beta-HSD activity in the epithelia of the ductuli efferentes distales and in the ductus epididymidis from March to June. The G6PDH and the 6PGDH showed positive reaction in the rete testis and ductuli efferentes proximales throughout the year. The 3 beta-HSD activity in testis and epididymis is saisonally different: In summer, there is no 3 beta-HSD activity in both organs. In winter, the 3 beta-HSD is demonstrable in the testis but not in the epididymis. In spring, there is 3 beta-HSD activity in the epididymis but not in the testis.
1181	3034230	Infection of duck plague carriers with Pasteurella multocida and P. anatipestifer.	Mo CL, Burgess EC	Avian Dis	 1987 Jan-Mar;31(1):197-201		Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) and white pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were infected with duck plague virus and challenged with LD20's of Pasteurella multocida and P. anatipestifer. There was no difference between mortality rates of duck plague-infected ducks and controls, suggesting that these organisms do not act synergistically under the conditions of our experiments. There was a difference of about 500-fold between the LD20 of P. multocida for mallards and that for white pekin ducks, indicating that mallards are much more susceptible to avian cholera than white pekin ducks.
1182	2890489	Osmoregulatory actions of angiotensin II are independent of adrenergic receptor mechanisms in the duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Wilson JX	Comp Biochem Physiol C Comp Pharmacol Toxicol	 1987;88(1):57-60	 doi: 101016/0742-8413(87)90046-6	1. Intravenous infusion of a physiological dose of fowl angiotensin II (ANG II) in salt-loaded ducks raised systemic arterial blood pressure, inhibited nasal salt gland fluid and solute secretion, and stimulated renal-cloacal urine production. 2. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol lowered arterial pressure but did not prevent the effects of ANG II on salt and water excretion. 3. Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade by prazosin decreased both arterial pressure and plasma glucose levels, but it did not impair the osmoregulatory actions of ANG II. 4. These observations indicate that redistribution by ANG II of salt and water excretion is independent of adrenergic receptor mechanisms and therefore does not depend on the sympathomimetic activity of the hormone.
1183	2432694	Effect of lindane on eggshell characteristics and calcium level in the domestic duck.	Chakravarty S, Lahiri P	Toxicology	 1986 Dec 15;42(2-3):245-58	 doi: 101016/0300-483x(86)90013-2	Adult laying domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were forced fed lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) 20 mg/kg body weight daily, thrice/week and twice/week for 8 weeks. Significant shell thinning (18-21%) was observed in ducks with daily and thrice/week lindane feeding. SEM studies of thinned eggshells revealed reduced and tightly clustered mammillae with apparent decrease in intermammillary spaces and signs of inhibition of calcite formation. Such structural changes of thinned shells were associated with a significant reduction in the level of calcium both of the plasma and of shell gland of the ducks. Simultaneously, density of the pore in the shell and pore area/cm2 of the shell in these birds were drastically reduced, presumably because of total absence of 'large' pores in such shells. Such porosity change is suggestive of reduced conductivity of eggshell implying impaired hatching success. Diethyl stilboestrol post-treatment neutralized all the adverse effects of lindane on duck eggshell, indicating induced estrogen deficiency in such birds by lindane.
1184	3803724	Training ducklings in broods interferes with maternal imprinting.	Lickliter R, Gottlieb G	Dev Psychobiol	 1986 Nov;19(6):555-66	 doi: 101002/dev420190607	Under natural conditions, if maternal imprinting is to occur it must occur in a social situation which includes the presence of broodmates. In the laboratory it has been shown that social rearing with siblings prior to maternal imprinting interferes with the establishment of maternal imprinting, whereas social experience with siblings after maternal imprinting enhances the imprinting experience. The present study examined the influence of social experience with broodmates during an imprinting trial on the establishment of a visually imprinted maternal preference in domestic mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos). Twenty-four-hour-old ducklings were allowed to follow a stuffed mallard hen for 30 min either individually or in a brood of four same-aged ducklings. The birds trained alone subsequently showed an imprinted preference for the familiar mallard hen over an unfamiliar pintail hen or four stuffed ducklings in simultaneous choice tests at 48 and 72 hr after hatching. Ducklings trained with broodmates did not show a preference for the familiar mallard hen over the unfamiliar pintail hen and displayed a preference for the stuffed ducklings over the mallard hen at 48 and 72 hr choice tests. These results demonstrate that even brief (30 min) experience with siblings during a maternal imprinting trial results in peer imprinting that interferes with the establishment of maternal imprinting. These and other results of a similar sort render dubious the significance of most laboratory studies of imprinting for an understanding of such events in nature.
1185	3774509	Thermally induced changes in neural and hormonal control of osmoregulation in a bird with salt glands (Anas platyrhynchos).	Hori T, Simon-Oppermann C, Gray DA, Simon E	Pflugers Arch	 1986 Oct;407(4):414-20	 doi: 101007/BF00652627	In conscious Pekin ducks adapted to hypertonic saline (1.9%) as drinking water, steady state secretion of the salt glands was established by continuous intravenous salt loading and the effects of hypothalamic thermal stimulation on salt gland activity and on the plasma concentrations of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and angiotensin II (AII) were observed. Hypothalamic cooling depressed salt gland secretion and the plasma level of AVT. Hypothalamic warming caused transient activation and subsequent inhibition of salt gland secretion without consistent changes of the plasma levels of AVT and AII. Whole body cooling by heat extraction with a colonic thermode produced moderate inhibition of salt gland activity, without changes in plasma AVT and AII, which may be explained by peripheral vasoconstriction. The results are consistent with the view that hypothalamic osmoregulation is under an influence of local temperature by combined osmo/thermo-responsiveness of hypothalamic neurons and temperature dependence of signal transmission in hypothalamic neural integration of osmoregulation.
1186	28311797	The role of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in distribution and germination of seeds of the submerged hydrophyteNajas marina L.	Agami M, Waisel Y	Oecologia	 1986 Sep;68(3):473-475	 doi: 101007/BF01036757	The effect of passage ofNajas marina L. seeds through the digestive system of the common mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) on their germinability was investigated. Most of the seeds ( approximately 70%), which were consumed by the birds were digested. However, germination of the remaining seeds was remarkably improved. Germination of seeds whose seed coats were mechanically cracked was also higher than that of the controls and equalled the germination percentage of the mallard-treated seeds. Seeds ofNajas are retained in the diegestive tracts of mallards for over 10 hours. Thus, as mallards are strong flyers, the seeds ofNajas may be distributed over long distances.
1187	3732620	Alarm call responsivity of mallard ducklings: III. Acoustic features affecting behavioral inhibition.	Miller DB, Blaich CF	Dev Psychobiol	 1986 Jul;19(4):291-301	 doi: 101002/dev420190402	Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal and locomotor behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call of their species. This study assesses the effects of varying acoustic features of alarm calls on the ducklings' freezing response (i.e., vocal and locomotor inhibition). Domestic mallard (Peking) ducklings were tested individually to alarm calls that varied either in note duration, frequency modulation, dominant frequency, repetition rate, or repetition rate in combination with these other features. The present study demonstrates that ducklings show a high degree of behavioral specificity to repetition rate (i.e., number of notes per second), relative to other acoustic features. This study also revealed that ducklings also exhibit some degree of behavioral specificity to note duration. Dominant frequency and frequency modulation play only a minor role in affecting behavioral inhibition. The behavioral specificity of mallard ducklings to slow repetition rates (that are typical of maternal alarm calls) provides a basis for the importance of their slow-rate perinatal vocalizations in the development of alarm call responsivity.
1188	3086222	Bile immunoglobulin of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). I. Preliminary characterization and ontogeny.	Ng PL, Higgins DA	Immunology	 1986 Jun;58(2):323-7		Immunoglobulin (Ig) of a single class was found in duck (Anas platyrhynchos) bile. Its molecular weight was 890,000; serum IgM was 800,000. Heavy chains were 75,000 for bile Ig, 86,000 for IgM, 67,000 for 7.8S IgG and 37,000 for 5.7S IgG. Antigenic comparison showed that bile Ig resembled IgM but carried additional determinants. The ontogeny of bile Ig was distinct from that of serum IgM and IgG. Thus, duck bile Ig appears to be an IgM-like molecule secreted independently of serum Ig.
1189	3709981	Visually imprinted maternal preference in ducklings is redirected by social interaction with siblings.	Lickliter R, Gottlieb G	Dev Psychobiol	 1986 May;19(3):265-77	 doi: 101002/dev420190312	This study examined the influence of social interaction with broodmates on a visually imprinted maternal preference in domestic mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) during the first three days of postnatal life. Twenty-four-hour-old ducklings were allowed to follow a stuffed mallard hen for 30 min. This experience resulted in a visually imprinted preference for the familiar stuffed hen over 4 stuffed ducklings in simultaneous choice tests at 48 and 72 hr after hatching, but only if the imprinted birds were kept in social isolation. Imprinted ducklings reared in a social group containing either same-age siblings or the stuffed mallard hen and same-age siblings displayed a visual preference for the stuffed ducklings over the familiar mallard hen at 48 and 72 hr tests. As a first step in the analysis of the features of the social exposure to siblings that are necessary for the redirection of the visually imprinted maternal preference, it was found that direct social interaction is essential to establish the preference for ducklings, but even mere visual exposure to siblings does away with the imprinted maternal preference. These results provide striking evidence of the ready redirection of a species-specific maternal preference in otherwise imprinted ducklings.
1190	2877916	Cardiovascular responses to neurohormones in conscious chickens and ducks.	Wilson JX, West NH	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1986 May;62(2):268-80	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(86)90117-6	Cardiovascular responses (cardiac frequency, fH; mean arterial pressure, Pa; ischiatic arterial blood flow; Qi; ischiatic vascular resistance, Ri) to 1-norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine (ACH), [Asp1, Val5]-angiotensin II (ANG II), and arginine vasotocin (AVT) were studied in conscious chickens (Gallus gallus) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Age-dependent changes, in the cardiovascular variables and the responses to the native avian neurohormones, were also studied in ducks. NE injection caused larger increases in Pa and Ri, and a greater associated fall in fH, in ducks than in chickens. The pressor effect of ANG II was more persistent and developed at a slower rate than the response to NE in both species, although the pressor effect was greater in ducks. Interestingly, ANG II injection caused a tachycardia in these baroreceptor-intact birds. ACH and AVT produced similar rapid falls in Pa and a corresponding tachycardia in both species, although the fH response was greater in ducks. ANG II rapidly increased NE concentration in the arterial plasma of adult ducks, while AVT increased epinephrine (E) concentration. Resting Pa and hematocrit were lower, and fH was higher, in immature ducks. Immature ducks also were less responsive than adults to the cardiovascular actions of NE, ACH, AVT, and ANG II. The results demonstrate differences in the cardiovascular responses to neurohormones in chickens and ducks consistent with a higher level of cardioinhibitory nervous tone and a greater sensitivity to sympathetic stimuli in the aquatic species, which increase during maturation.
1191	3714439	Capsaicin fails to produce disturbances of autonomic heat and cold defence in an avian species (Anas platyrhynchos).	Geisthovel E, Ludwig O, Simon E	Pflugers Arch	 1986 Apr;406(4):343-50	 doi: 101007/BF00590934	Capsaicin was intravenously administered to adult domestic ducks of 1.8-2.6 kg body weight, with a cumulative dose of 1.0 g/kg body weight given in 4-6 single infusions at intervals of 2-3 days. There were no acute, nociceptive or hypothermic effects, as typically seen in mammals. Before and after capsaicin treatment respiratory evaporative heat loss (REHL, w X kg-1), breathing frequency (BF, min-1) and metabolic heat production (M, w X kg-1) were determined in a warm environment (35-38 degrees C) as a function of core temperature, measured in the esophagus (Tes), which was altered by graded heat extraction with a colonic thermode. Capsaicin treatment reduced the rate at which REHL increased with increasing BF, however, this was compensated by a steeper increase of BF with rising Tes so that the relationship between Tes and REHL remained unchanged. The Tes threshold for activation of M was increased by 0.3 degrees C and the slope reduced by 27% after capsaicin, but identical maximum M values were attained before and after capsaicin at identical degrees of hypothermia. Skin temperature measurements revealed no influence of capsaicin on the threshold Tes values for skin vasoconstriction. It is concluded that capsaicin fails to exert effects in birds on those afferents and central neurons which are involved in thermo- and nociception, in contrast to mammals in which these perceptive functions become severely impaired.
1192	2421458	Effect of lindane on clutch size and level of egg yolk protein in domestic duck.	Chakravarty S, Mandal A, Lahiri P	Toxicology	 1986 Apr;39(1):93-103	 doi: 101016/0300-483x(86)90162-9	Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) was administered to laying ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) in 3 doses viz. (1) 20 mg/kg body weight daily, (2) 20 mg/kg body weight thrice weekly and (3) 20 mg/kg body weight twice weekly for 8 weeks. Egg laying was immediately stopped for 3 weeks in the first 2 groups and when resumed it became highly irregular with clutch size drastically reduced (1 against 7 of control ducks). The initial delay was absent in the 3rd group and reduction in clutch size was also marginal (5 against 7). Laying frequencies were 8.3%, 11.7% and 40% in Groups 1, 2 and 3 birds respectively against 50% frequency of the normal ducks. Hepatic, plasma and ovarian vitellogenin levels were substantially reduced in the first 2 groups. At the same time liver RNA level was markedly reduced. Ovary of such birds lack mature vitellogenic follicles and the thecal layer of moderately differentiated oocytes became highly atrophic. Stilbestrol (50 mg/kg body wt--single injection) administration to lindane fed pauci-layer ducks restored egg laying within 24 h, with return of a normal level of plasma vitellogenin and hepatic RNA. The results suggest that lindane induced estradiol insufficiency causes inhibition of hepatic RNA and yolk protein synthesis, thereby preventing transformation of moderately differentiated oocytes to mature vitellogenic follicles, delaying ovulation and thus drastically reducing clutch size.
1193	3958677	The contribution of nasal receptors to the cardiac response to diving in restrained and unrestrained redhead ducks (Aythya americana).	Furilla RA, Jones DR	J Exp Biol	 1986 Mar;121:227-38	 doi: 101242/jeb1211227	In restrained redhead ducks, forced submergence caused heart rate to fall from 100 +/- 3 beats min-1 (mean +/- S.E.M., N = 12) to a stable underwater rate of 35 +/- 4 beats min-1 (N = 12) within 5 s after submergence. Bradycardia was unaffected by breathing oxygen before a dive, but was virtually eliminated by local anaesthesia of the narial region. In contrast, in a dabbling duck (Anas platyrhynchos) bradycardia in short dives was eliminated by breathing oxygen before a dive. In unrestrained diving, on a man-made pond, heart rate in redheads diving voluntarily (y) was related to pre-dive heart rate (x) by the equation y = 76 + 0.29 +/- 0.05x +/- 17 (r2 = 0.71). Chasing, to induce submergence, had variable effects on this relationship. Local anaesthesia of the narial region inhibited voluntary diving but heart rates in chase-induced dives after nasal blockade were significantly higher, by 10-30%, than those obtained from untreated ducks in chase-induced dives. Breathing oxygen before voluntary dives had no apparent effect on heart rate after 2-5 s submergence. Voluntary head submersion by dabbling ducks caused no change in heart rate. We conclude that nasal receptors make only a minor contribution to cardiac responses in unrestrained dives, compared with forced dives, in diving ducks. Furthermore, these results show that little can be learned about cardiac responses in free diving ducks from studies of forced dives in dabblers or divers.
1194	3954224	Myocardial ultrastructural alterations in ducklings with isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicosis.	Okerberg CV, Van Vleet JF	Am J Vet Res	 1986 Feb;47(2):394-400		Fifty-two, 8-week-old, male White Pekin ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were allotted into control (n = 7) and isoproterenol-injected groups (n = 45). One control duck and 5 to 7 isoproterenol-injected (200 mg/kg of body weight) ducklings were euthanatized at postinjection hours (PIH) 1, 12, and 24 and at postinjection days (PID) 2, 4, 7, and 14. The left ventricular myocardium was examined, using electron microscopy. The earliest ultrastructural alteration in damaged myocytes was myofibrillar lysis at PIH 12. At PIH 24, affected myocytes had necrosis with mineralization of mitochondria. By PID 2, macrophages had invaded into areas of myocardial necrosis, mineralization was prominent in myocyte mitochondria, and dedifferentiated myocytes with reduced numbers of myofibrils, increased numbers of polysomes, large nuclei, and prominent nucleoli were first observed. The primary myocardial finding at PID 4, 7, and 14 was 2 populations of sublethally damaged myocytes. One population of injured myocytes had numerous polysomes in the sarcoplasm and large nuclei with prominent nucleoli, indicating attempts at repair of myofibrillar damage. The 2nd population of myocytes with myofibrillar lysis did not have morphologic evidence of myofibrillar repair. Therefore, the sequential ultrastructural alterations of damage and repair induced by isoproterenol in the duckling myocardium provided model for comparative studies of cardiotoxicity.
1195	3007271	Alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms mediate blood pressure control by norepinephrine and angiotensin in ducks.	Butler DG, Wilson JX, Graves LE	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1986 Feb;61(2):323-9	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(86)90209-1	Adrenergic mechanisms for the pressor actions of blood-borne L-norepinephrine (NE) and fowl angiotensin II (ANG II) were studied in barbiturate-anesthetized adult ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). NE (1.5-6.0 nmol X kg-1) or ANG II (0.4-1.6 nmol X kg-1) injected iv caused dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure (Pa) and pulse pressure (Pp) but slowed cardiac frequency (fH); higher doses of ANG II increased Pa, Pp, and fH X beta-Adrenergic blockade by propranolol lowered baseline Pa, completely blocked cardiovascular responses to isoproterenol, augmented the bradycardic effect of NE, and inhibited the stimulation of Pp by ANG II. However, the tachycardiac effect of high-dose ANG II persisted during beta-blockade. alpha-Adrenergic blockade following iv prazosin completely blocked the pressor effect of methoxamine, diminished the pressure response to NE, and decreased Pa sensitivity to ANG II injections. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade decreased both the sensitivity and the maximal Pa response to ANG II. We conclude that (i) beta-adrenergic mechanisms predominate in the maintenance of resting Pa, (ii) NE increases Pa principally by alpha-adrenergic action while beta-adrenergic stimulation buffers the consequent bradycardia, and (iii) although the positive chronotropic effect of high doses of ANG II probably is not mediated by catecholamines, low doses of ANG II elevate Pa and Pp by alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms.
1196	3951061	Gastrointestinal helminths of the Mexican duck, Anas platyrhynchos diazi Ridgway, from north central Mexico and southwestern United States.	Farias JD, Canaris AG	J Wildl Dis	 1986 Jan;22(1):51-4	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-22151	Twenty-five species of helminths, recovered from the gastrointestinal tracts of 129 Mexican ducks from Mexico and the United States, were all new host records. The species included: Echinoparyphium recurvatum, Echinostoma revolutum, Hypoderaeum conoideum, Notocotylus attenuatus, Prosthogonimus cuneatus, Zygocotyle lunata, Anomotaenia ciliata, Cloacotaenia megalops, Diorchis bulbodes, Diorchis sp., Drepanidotaenia lanceolata, Echinocotyle rosseteri, Fimbriaria fasciolaris, Fimbriarioides sp., Hymenolepis sp. 1, Hymenolepis sp. 2, Sobolevicanthus gracilis. Corynosoma constrictum, Polymorphus minutus, Amidostomum acutum, Echinuria sp., Epomidiostomum crami, Hystrichis varispinosus, Rusguniella arctica, and Tetrameres sp. Fimbriarioides sp. occurred predominantly in ducks from south-central Chihuahua, Mexico. The distributions for the other 24 species of the helminths were not significantly different among the four collecting areas. The helminth fauna for the 32 complete specimens and 97 intestinal tracts was distributed relatively evenly among the hosts with a calculated mean evenness of 0.77 +/- 0.15 and 0.89 +/- 0.03 respectively. The parasite fauna was more similar to those of the black duck Anas rubripes Brewster of eastern North America (53%), the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos (L.) (49%), and the mottled duck, Anas fulvigula Ridgway, from Florida (45%), than to the green-winged teal, Anas crecca (L.) (36%), the gadwall, Anas strepera (L.) (30%), and the American wigeon, Anas americana Gmelin (26%), collected in the Southwest.
1197	3940926	Comparative study on the cardiac actions of bovine parathyroid hormone (1-34).	Sham JS, Wong VC, Chiu KW, Pang PK	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1986 Jan;61(1):148-52	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(86)90260-1	The cardiac stimulatory effects of bovine parathyroid hormone (1-34) [bPTH-(1-34)] were studied on isolated atria and ventricular strips from cobra snakes (Naja naja), ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos), pigeons (Columba livia), Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica), laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus), and dogs (Canis familiaris). In all atrial preparations, bPTH-(1-34) caused positive chronotropism. This suggests that the chronotropic effect of PTH is ubiquitous among the terrestrial vertebrates. Only the atria of cobra snakes and ducklings gave positive inotropic responses to PTH. No ventricular preparations showed significant response to bPTH-(1-34). This suggests the absence of cardiac stimulatory PTH receptors in the ventricles. Dog papillary muscle, however, showed slight but significant responses to bPTH-(1-34). The reason for this discrepancy between the responses of papillary muscles and the ventricular strips to PTH is unknown.

Martin GR	Vision Res	 1986;26(8):1303-5	 doi: 101016/0042-6989(86)90112-4	The mallard duck has a retinal visual field giving 360 degrees visual coverage in the horizontal plane and a narrow binocular field of approximately uniform width (approximately equal to 20 degrees) extending through 220 degrees from the bill to directly behind the head. Measurement of the optical fields indicate that the binocular retinal field could be considerably larger than actually found. Eye movements are not of sufficient amplitude to abolish binocularity at any elevation.
1199	3751687	Topographical representation of the jaw muscles within the trigeminal motor nucleus. An HRP study in the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos.	den Boer PJ, Bout RG, Dubbeldam LJ	Acta Morphol Neerl Scand	 1986;24(1):1-17		The location of the trigeminal motoneurons of the jaw muscles has been determined in the brainstem of the mallard utilizing retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Injections with HRP into the jaw muscles or application of HRP to the mandibular nerve showed that the trigeminal motor nucleus can be subdivided into five subnuclei, mV1-mV5. Three functional groups of jaw muscles are represented in separate subnuclei. The most lateral subnucleus mV2 innervates all but one adductor muscles, the intermediate mV1 innervates the pterygoid muscles + one adductor and the medial mV4 the two protractor muscles. The most ventral subnucleus mV3 contains the neurons innervating two extrinsic tongue muscles as well as some perikarya of adductor muscles. Subnucleus mV5 lies dorsomedial to mV4 and contains the motoneurons of the depressor muscle of the lower eye lid. Elements of the proprioceptive system, viz. presumptive gamma-neurons and mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus cells, could also be visualized. The topological and functional aspects of the subdivision of the motor nucleus are discussed.
1200	3540108	Immunohistochemical study of the distribution of vasotocin reacting neurons in avian diencephalon.	Viglietti-Panzica C	J Hirnforsch	 1986;27(5):559-66		Vasotocin (VT)- and neurophysin (NPH)-containing neurons were immunocytochemically demonstrated in the diencephalon of the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), domestic fowl (Gallus gallus), and Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos). In these three avian species, the immunoreactive cells are similarly distributed into three different diencephalic regions: lateral (L), periventricular (P), and dorsal diencephalic (DD). A different number of cell clusters can be easily identified in each region according to its topographical location. Interspecific differences depend on the total number of immunoreactive cells, the cell sizes and the density in each cell cluster. Present results show that the nomenclature of the VT-system originally proposed for the pigeon can be easily applied to all the avian species so far topographically studied. The group nomenclature based only upon the location of immunoreactive elements may avoid potentially inaccurate mammalian homologies, and makes easier the comparison between studies performed in different birds.
1201	3089881	PCB intake and the growth of waterfowl: multivariate analyses based on a reparameterized Richards sigmoid model.	Brisbin IL Jr, White GC, Bush PB	Growth	 1986 Spring;50(1):1-11		Multivariate analyses of the parameters of a modified Richards growth model were used to determine the effects of sex and varying levels of dietary intake of PCB's (0-50 ppm), on the asymptotic size (W infinity), total growing time (T) and shape (m) of the growth curves of game farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and wild wood ducks (Aix sponsa) raised under laboratory conditions. Level of PCB intake did not affect any of the growth parameters of the wood ducks, while sex affected both m and W infinity, with males of this species growing to greater body weights and showing slightly lower shape parameters than females. Growth characteristics of the mallards on the other hand, did not differ between the sexes. PCB intake however, had a significant effect on the shape of the mallard growth curve, but did not affect either W infinity or T. All interactions between sex and PCB treatment level were non-significant in both species. The growth responses of game-farm mallards to PCB intake cannot be assumed to typify that of other wild waterfowl species without additional evidence from comparative studies.
1202	2415525	Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA for S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase from the uropygial gland of mallard duck.	Poulose AJ, Rogers L, Cheesbrough TM, Kolattukudy PE	J Biol Chem	 1985 Dec 15;260(29):15953-8		In vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA from the uropygial glands of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) generated a 29-kDa protein which cross-reacted with rabbit antibodies prepared against S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase (Kolattukudy, P. E., Rogers, L., and Flurkey, W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem., 260, 10789-10793). A poly(A)+ RNA fraction enriched in this thioesterase mRNA, isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, was used to prepare cDNA which was cloned in Escherichia coli using the plasmid pUC9. Using hybrid-selected translation and colony hybridization, 17 clones were selected which contained the cDNA for S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase. Northern blot analysis showed that the mature mRNA for this thioesterase contained 1350 nucleotides whereas the cloned cDNA inserts contained 1150-1200 base pairs. Five of the 6 clones tested for 5'-sequence had identical sequences, and the three tested for 3'-end showed the same sequence with poly(A) tails. Two clones, pTE1 and pTE3, representing nearly the full length of mRNA, were selected for sequencing. Maxam-Gilbert and Sanger dideoxy chain termination methods were used on the cloned cDNA and on restriction fragments subcloned in M13 in order to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA. The nucleotide sequence showed an open reading frame coding for a peptide of 28.8 kDa. Two peptides isolated from the tryptic digest of the thioesterase purified from the gland showed amino acid sequences which matched with two segments of the sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence. Another segment containing a serine residue showed an amino acid sequence homologous to the active serine-containing segment of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase. Thus, the clones represent cDNA for S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase. The present results constitute the first case of a complete sequence of a thioesterase.
1203	4075777	Social interaction with siblings is necessary for visual imprinting of species-specific maternal preferences in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lickliter R, Gottlieb G	J Comp Psychol	 1985 Dec;99(4):371-9		This study was conducted to examine the influence of various social rearing experiences on the development of imprinted visual maternal preferences in domestic mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) during the first 3 days of postnatal life. Twenty-four-hour-old ducklings were allowed to follow a stuffed mallard hen for 30 min. This experience resulted in a visual preference for the familiar mallard hen over an unfamiliar stuffed redhead (Aythya americana) hen in simultaneous choice tests at 48 hr and 72 hr only if the ducklings were reared in conditions allowing unrestricted social interaction with siblings, as would normally occur in nature. No visual preference for the familiar mallard model was found at 48 hr or at 72 hr if ducklings were reared in social isolation but allowed to see another duckling, reared with one duckling, or reared in a group of ducklings but denied the opportunity for direct social interaction. These results demonstrate the importance of normal social experience in the development of the visual imprinting of filial behavior in ducklings. Imprinting studies have traditionally employed isolation rearing and ignored the precocial bird's natural social context. Thus, the present findings raise doubts about the appropriateness of the usual methods of studying imprinting in the laboratory for an understanding of the process of filial imprinting in nature.
1204	3878351	Disease patterns in the Detroit Zoo: a study of the avian population from 1973 through 1983.	Kaneene JB, Taylor RF, Sikarskie JG, Meyer TJ, Richter NA	J Am Vet Med Assoc	 1985 Dec 1;187(11):1129-31		A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate disease patterns in birds at the Detroit Zoo from 1973 through 1983. Data were derived from the zoo's medical and animal census records; the mean (+/- SD) population of birds during the study period was 469 +/- 42. Overall annual morbidity rates were 12.5% to 21.5%, with spring months having the highest morbidity rates. Annual mortality rates were 3.1% to 15.2%; 23.9% of the deaths were caused by microbial agents (particularly Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, hemolytic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Aeromonas spp and Proteus spp), 15.4% by trauma, and 42.5% by nondetermined causes. The mute swan (Cygnus olor), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), common gallinule (Gallinula chloropus), common rhea (Rhea americana), and red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) were the 5 species most frequently affected of the 1,032 deaths from 1973 through 1983. The most frequently isolated parasites were Microtetramere spp, coccidian species, Diplotriaena spp, and Trichomonia spp.
1205	24896699	Mate choice and male behaviour following castration and replacement of testosterone in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos ).	Klint T	Behav Processes	 1985 Nov;11(4):419-24	 doi: 101016/0376-6357(85)90006-3	Male sexual behaviour was controlled by castration and testosterone replacement. The first experiment shows that, within a group of similarly coloured and castrated male mallards, females preferred males treated with testosterone. The second experiment shows that a testosterone-treated male was always preferred by the females, irrespective of plumage colour, in a choice between a wild and a white mallard drake. The results shows that testosterone dependent male cues is important in mate choice in the mallard duck.
1206	2998920	Independence of salt gland function and adrenocortical activity in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Harvey S, Phillips JG, Rees A	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1985 Nov;60(2):210-4	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(85)90316-8	In immature ducklings injected with hypertonic saline the volume of extrarenal salt gland secretion was unaffected by prior treatment (immediately or 4 hr before salt loading) with long-lasting adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH 100 iu/kg, im) or exogenous corticosterone (1.0 mg/kg, im). Pretreatment with metyrapone, an 11-beta-hydroxylase blocker, (80 mg/kg, im) 4 hr before salt loading did not effect the volume of salt gland secretion but delayed the onset of extrarenal excretion. Salt gland function was suppressed in birds pretreated with metyrapone immediately prior to salt loading. The intravenous administration of metyrapone after salt loading immediately reduced salt gland activity, which remained suppressed for at least 40-50 min thereafter. The inhibitory effect of metyrapone on salt gland activity was not counteracted by the subsequent or simultaneous administration of exogenous corticosterone to salt-loaded ducks. These results suggest that acute alterations in adrenocortical activity are not causally responsible for changes in salt gland function.
1207	2414344	Primary sensory ganglion cells projecting to the principal trigeminal nucleus in the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos.	Kishida R, Dubbeldam JL, Goris RC	J Comp Neurol	 1985 Oct 8;240(2):171-9	 doi: 101002/cne902400207	The trigeminal and glossopharyngeal ganglia of the adult mallard were studied following HRP injections into the principal trigeminal nucleus (PrV). The PrV consists of the principal trigeminal nucleus proper (prV) and the principal glossopharyngeal nucleus (prIX). After an injection into the prV, the labeled cells were found in the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion. After an injection into the prIX, labeled cells were found in the ipsilateral distal glossopharyngeal ganglion, but not in the proximal ganglion of the IX and X cranial nerve (pGIX + X). In Nissl preparations, two types of ganglion cells in the trigeminal ganglion, pGIX + X, and distal ganglion of N IX could be distinguished: larger light cells and smaller dark cells. We could not determine whether the HRP-labeled cells belonged to both types or to one of them; but because all the labeled cells were over 20 microns, we concluded that the smallest cells (10-19 microns) in the trigeminal ganglion and distal ganglion of N IX did not project to the PrV. The labeling of the cells in the distal ganglion of N IX (average 34.5 microns) was uniformly moderate. In the trigeminal ganglion there were two types of labeled cells: heavily labeled cells (average 29.1 microns) and moderately labeled cells (average 35.1 l microns). These two types of labeling (moderate and heavy) may reflect two types of primary sensory neurons: cells with ascending, nonbifurcating axons, and cells with bifurcating axons. We speculate that the former are proprioceptive neurons and the latter tactile neurons. Labeled bifurcating axons in the sensory trigeminal complex gave off collaterals to all parts of the descending trigeminal nucleus except to the caudalmost laminated spinal part.
1208	4054582	Control of plasma angiotensin II in a bird with salt glands (Anas platyrhynchos).	Gray DA, Simon E	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1985 Oct;60(1):1-13	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(85)90285-0	A radioimmunoassay was developed for the measurement of avian angiotensin II (1Asp-5Val-AII) in the blood plasma. This assay was used to investigate the relationship between body fluid parameters and plasma levels of AII in the Pekin duck, an avian species employing salt glands, besides the kidneys, for NaCl excretion in case of chronic salt stress. A plasma AII concentration of 35.3 +/- 3.9 pg X ml-1 (mean +/- SE) was found in normally hydrated, freshwater-adapted (FW) ducks with a plasma osmolality of 294.9 +/- 0.9 milliosmoles (mOsm) X kg-1. In saltwater-adapted (SW) ducks with a plasma osmolality of 312 +/- 1.5 mOsm X kg-1 and functioning salt glands, a plasma AII level of 102.6 +/- 9.3 pg X ml-1 was found and plasma AII was positively correlated with plasma osmolality (r = 0.601; n = 47; 2P less than 0.001). Intravenous infusion of AII at different rates resulted in a strictly linear relationship between the log values of the AII plasma concentrations and the infusion rates, indicating a plasma clearance rate for AII of 119 ml X min-1 X kg-1 when taking into consideration endogenous AII formation. Experiments designed to produce physiological changes in body fluid and plasma volume and tonicity in FW and SW ducks by appropriate salt and/or water loading indicate that although both parameters may contribute to the control of plasma AII, volume is the dominant stimulus.
1209	3834775	An HRP study of the central connections of the facial nerve in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Bout RG, Dubbeldam JL	Acta Morphol Neerl Scand	 1985 Oct;23(2):181-93		The location of several facialis innervated muscles has been determined by injecting individual muscles with horseradish peroxidase. The depressors of the lower jaw are represented in the dorsal facial motor nucleus and the tongue retractor muscles in the intermediate facial motor nucleus. HRP was also directly applied to the rostral and caudal branch of the facial nerve. The afferent connections are described including two small projections to the principal sensory nucleus and n. interpolaris which were not found in birds before.
1210	24258034	Radio-telemetry as an aid to environmental contaminant evaluation of mobile wildlife species.	Eberhardt LE, Cadwell LL	Environ Monit Assess	 1985 Sep;5(3):283-9	 doi: 101007/BF00394069	Radio transmitters are a useful tool in determining the degree of use of and extent of movement from contaminated sites by highly mobile wildlife species. Programs monitoring wildlife species for environmental contaminants from localized sources can maximize the amount of information obtained from an individual animal by using radio-telemetry to ascertain residence history. The use of radio-telemetry techniques on two mobile wildlife species, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), to document their use of and movement from low-level radionuclide contaminated waste ponds are described.
1211	4051308	Ultrastructure of the testis of Pekin ducks fed methyl mercury chloride: seminiferous epithelium.	McNeil SI, Bhatnagar MK	Am J Vet Res	 1985 Sep;46(9):2019-25		Testicular cells of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) fed with 0 (control), 0.5 (group 1), 5 (group 2), or 15 (group 3) mg of methyl mercury chloride (CH3HgCl)/kg of basal feed for 12 weeks were examined by electron microscope. Sertoli's cells from ducks in group 2 had dilated smooth endoplasm reticulum, increased lysosomes, and large vacuoles, some with lipid droplets. Degenerative changes were more advanced in group 3 ducks. There were increases in lysosomes, myelinoid figures, vacuolations, cytoplasmic and nuclear debris, cristolyses of mitochondria, and distended Golgi's complexes, and a reduction in smooth endoplasm reticulum and microtubules when compared with those of the controls. Spermatogonia were resistant to CH3HgCl exposure, except in 2 ducks from group 3 which had cells that showed electron-lucent cytoplasm, abnormal mitochondria, and membrane-bound vacuoles. In primary spermatocytes, degenerative changes were evident in ducks fed the larger dose levels. In nuclei, synaptonemal complexes showed unpaired elements. In cytoplasm, cellular debris and vacuoles predominated. There was an increase in synchronized meiosis and apparent incomplete cell division. In ducks from group 3, the cellular damage was more severe and was present throughout the germinal epithelium. Spermatids differentiation was affected variably in groups 2 and 3. Severity of damage increased with the increased dosage of mercury. Where there was spermiogenic activity, the electron-dense acrosome granules, manchette, and midpiece were rarely found. Since the seminiferous tubules from 2 ducks in group 3 had severe destruction of spermatocytes and spermatids, the spermiogenic activity was negligible. Ingestion of CH3HgCl caused toxic injury to seminiferous tubules in groups 2 and 3 ducks. The degree of damage was related to the dietary amount of mercury.
1212	2995197	Corticosterone and aldosterone dose-dependent responses to ACTH and angiotensin II in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Klingbeil CK	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1985 Sep;59(3):382-90	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(85)90395-8	The effects of [1-24]ACTH, [5-Val]angiotensin II, and potassium (K+) on the secretion of corticosterone and aldosterone by tissue slices from the subcapsular (SCZ) and inner (IZ) zones of the duck adrenal gland were determined using incubation and superfusion systems. Both methods demonstrated that the release of corticosterone and aldosterone from IZ and SCZ cells was dependent on the ACTH dose concentration. The IZ cells produced more corticosterone than the SCZ cells in response to stimulation with 1-1000 ng ACTH/ml. The dose response by aldosterone from the cells of the SCZ and the IZ were comparable, but the proportion of aldosterone per total amount of steroid released was greater by cells of the SCZ (11.3%), than by cells of the IZ (3.6%). Elevating the K+ concentration in the incubation medium from 4.0 to 6.5 and 11.2 mM did not directly stimulate corticosteroid release or potentiate the stimulatory effect of ACTH. Superfusion with 10(-12) to 10(-5) M AII stimulated the release of aldosterone from the SCZ cells but had no detectable effect on the IZ and failed to stimulate corticosterone release from either the SCZ or IZ cells. The results presented here demonstrate that in the bird stimulation for the release of corticosterone and aldosterone are different. Methodology for superfusion of adrenal tissue and for the direct radioimmunoassay of aldosterone and corticosterone in the superfusate are described.
1213	4045323	Disappearance of short chain acids from the preen gland wax of male mallard ducks during eclipse.	Kolattukudy PE, Bohnet S, Rogers L	J Lipid Res	 1985 Aug;26(8):989-94		Wax esters constitute the major products of the uropygial glands of male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Combined gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of the acyl and alcohol portions of the wax ester revealed dramatic seasonal variation. Of the total of nearly 100 compounds detected in the acyl portion, more than 90 were identified as n-, monomethyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyl-C6 to C20 acids. The major components were 2-methyl- and 4-methyl C6 acids which constituted nearly 75% of the total acids during most of the year. As the birds went through the post-nuptial molt into eclipse, these short chain acids decreased to only 4% of the total acids. Fatty acids longer than C12 became the major components during the summer months when the birds were in eclipse and by fall the characteristic shorter branched acids reappeared as the dominant components. Fatty alcohols did not undergo such dramatic changes. This is the first report of biochemical changes that occur during eclipse.
1214	4017995	Effects of cadmium ingestion and food restriction on energy metabolism and tissue metal concentrations in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Di Giulio RT, Scanlon PF	Environ Res	 1985 Aug;37(2):433-44	 doi: 101016/0013-9351(85)90125-2	The single and combined effects of cadmium ingestion and food restriction were examined in a 42-day experiment with male, juvenile mallard ducks. A 2 X 3 factorial design was employed consisting of two levels of food supply (ad libitum and 55% of ad libitum intake) and three levels of cadmium in the food (0, 5, or 50 micrograms Cd/g food). Cadmium ingestion alone had no effect on body or tissue weights, liver glycogen, plasma concentrations of glucose, urea, uric acid, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), or plasma or adrenal concentrations of corticosterone. The food restriction resulted in reduced body weights and reduced weights of livers, kidneys, and testes, increased adrenal weights, reduced liver glycogen, increased plasma NEFA concentrations, reduced plasma T3 and T4 concentrations, and increased adrenal corticosterone concentrations. In combination with the food restriction, cadmium ingestion further reduced plasma T3 concentrations and a similar trend was noted for T4. Additionally, the highest plasma NEFA concentrations and highest plasma and adrenal concentrations of corticosterone were observed in food-restricted ducks receiving the highest level of dietary cadmium. These results suggest the ability of cadmium ingestion to enhance food restriction-induced alterations in energy metabolism at levels of dietary cadmium that are by themselves without apparent effect. Also, cadmium ingestion resulted in increased kidney concentrations of copper and zinc; this effect on kidney zinc concentrations was increased in food-restricted ducks.
1215	3929351	Blood flow distribution during hypocapnic hypoxia in Pekin ducks and bar-headed geese.	Faraci FM, Kilgore DL Jr, Fedde MR	Respir Physiol	 1985 Jul;61(1):21-30	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(85)90025-8	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of hypocapnic hypoxia on regional blood flow in birds. Regional blood flow was measured using the radioactive microsphere method in unanesthetized Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) breathing 21, 10 and 5% O2. In both birds, arterial PO2 was reduced from about 96 Torr during normoxia to about 28 Torr during severe hypoxia. Severe hypocapnic hypoxia produced a change in the pattern of blood flow in ducks; blood flow to some organs increased (brain, adrenal glands, heart, and eyes) while flow to other organs decreased (liver, spleen, small intestine, shell gland). Compared with ducks, bar-headed geese were able to provide higher levels of O2 delivery to their tissues since blood flow to a variety of organs and skeletal muscles was either unchanged or increased during severe hypoxia. The redistribution of blood flow in Pekin ducks during severe hypocapnic hypoxia may help to support large increases in cerebral and coronary blood flow but may also contribute to the development of a metabolic acidosis.
1216	2991075	Transitory corticosterone responses of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) to exercise.	Rees A, Harvey S, Phillips JG	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1985 Jul;59(1):100-4	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(85)90423-x	Horizontal treadmill exercise induced a marked (P less than 0.001) but transitory increase in the level of circulating corticosterone in the plasma of adult male ducks. The decline in corticosterone concentration during exercise is unlikely to be due to a depletion of adrenocortical stores since a marked (P less than 0.001) corticosterone response to adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) administration was observed immediately after exercise, and was of similar magnitude to that induced in nonexercised controls. The corticosterone response to repeated exercise is also transitory, habituating completely within 28 days of the start of daily training. The corticosterone response (P less than 0.001) to ACTH challenge is not, however, diminished by training. These results indicate that the habituation of the corticosterone response to either acute or repeated exercise is due to a reduction in endogenous ACTH secretion. A similar mechanism appears to be responsible for the habituation of the corticosterone response to handling and confinement in nonexercised control birds. A marked (P less than 0.001) increase in the level of circulating corticosterone was, however, elicited when these birds were exercised, indicating that despite adaptation to handling and confinement the birds remained responsive to the novel stressor of exercise. The corticosterone response of these birds was, however, less than that in untrained birds indicating that the corticosterone response in untrained birds is due to both workload and the stress of handling and confinement.
1217	2862973	Growth hormone secretion and pancreatic function following somatostatin infusion in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Strosser MT, Harvey S, Foltzer C, Mialhe P	Br Poult Sci	 1985 Jul;26(3):425-32	 doi: 101080/00071668508416831	The intravenous infusion of somatostatin (800 ng/kg min) reduced the concentration of growth hormone (GH) in the plasma of 4 to 5, 6 to 7 and 8 to 9 week-old ducklings, but not in adult ducks. The inhibition of GH secretion was not due to accompanying changes in pancreatic function, since the infusion of a lower dose of somatostatin (200 ng/kg min) increased glucagon release and decreased plasma free fatty acids (FFA), as observed with the higher dose, but had no effect on GH concentrations. The withdrawal of somatostatin inhibition resulted in rebound GH secretion in immature birds, the magnitude of which was directly related to the pre-treatment level. Following somatostatin infusion (800 ng/kg min) no modification in GH concentration was observed in adult ducks. These results demonstrate that basal GH release in young birds is not autonomous and is suppressible by somatostatin. The data provide further evidence for age-related changes in the control of avian GH and insulin release and for the independence of the effects of somatostatin on the pituitary and pancreas glands.
1218	3896655	Ontogeny of the 38K epsilon-polypeptide during lens development of the duck Anas platyrhynchos.	Brahma SK, Defize LH	Curr Eye Res	 1985 Jun;4(6):679-84	 doi: 103109/02713688509017662	The epsilon-crystallin polypeptide is a recently described protein in the eye lens of the peking duck, Anas platyrhynchos. It does not cross react with alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-crystallins. It has a molecular weight of 120K and consists of 3 identical 38K polypeptides. It is found in some reptiles and birds. The ontogeny of this polypeptide has been investigated in the developing A. platyrhynchos lens via the indirect immunofluorescence staining using a homologous antibody. The 38K polypeptide was extracted from 13% Tris-SDS acrylamide gels, lyophilized and injected into a young rabbit to raise an antibody. The purity of the isolated 38K polypeptide and and the specificity of the antibody were checked by Tris-SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, respectively. The first positive reaction is detected at 80 h (stage 18) incubated lens. It is confined to a few elongating early primary fibres. Until the 9th day of development the reaction is confined to the primary and secondary lens fibres. The first positive reaction in the annular pad area is observed in the "day 10" lens. In the anterior epithelium the first positive reaction is detectable in the "day 12" lens. At the beginning it is confined to a few cells in the center of the epithelium and gradually the reaction spreads to other cells. A strong and uniform reaction in the entire epithelium is noted for the first time in the lens of a just-hatched duckling. The 38K epsilon-polypeptide is detectable after the alpha-, beta-, and delta-crystallins, which, in the duck, appear simultaneously from 66 h (stage 15/16).
1219	3891506	Seasonal variation in pituitary responsiveness to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone of mallards and canvasbacks.	Bluhm CK	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1985 Jun;58(3):491-7	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(85)90124-8	Endocrine profiles of wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) were determined during the spring and the summer. Males and females of each species were treated with a single intravenous injection of 12 micrograms of synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). Preinjection and postinjection blood samples were collected and LH levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. LHRH evoked a brisk and significant elevation in serum LH in all ducks indicating the pituitary glands of both species contain readily releasable pools of LH. In March, the preinjection baseline levels of LH in the two groups did not differ. However, mallards responded to LHRH with a twofold increase in serum LH, while canvasbacks responded with a fourfold increase (F = 17.1, P less than 0.001). At the summer blood sampling period, mallards had significantly higher circulating levels of serum LH than canvasbacks (F = 35.9, P less than 0.001). Both species responded to LHRH with a twofold increase in circulating LH. These data indicate that seasonal variations in reproduction shown by the two species in captivity may be associated with differences in LHRH-sensitive pools of LH.
1220	3988030	Effects of chronic changes in dietary electrolytes and acute stress on plasma levels of corticosterone and aldosterone in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Klingbeil CK	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1985 Apr;58(1):10-9	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(85)90131-5	Plasma levels of corticosterone and aldosterone were determined by radioimmunoassay in ducks consuming diets containing different concentrations of sodium and potassium. Compared with control diet birds, maintenance on a high-Na+ diet for 5 days caused a 2-fold increase in the basal plasma corticosterone concentration, while adaptation for 8 days to a low-Na+ diet resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in the basal plasma concentration of aldosterone. Both corticosterone and aldosterone basal plasma levels were greatly elevated in birds denied access to drinking water for 4 days. Adaptation to a high-Na+ diet or deprivation of water resulted in hyperosmolality and hypernatremia, while the high-K+, low-Na+/low-K+, and low-Na+ diets did not significantly alter the plasma sodium or potassium levels from the control levels. In addition, birds were stressed by semi-immobilization to determine the effects of acute stress-induced ACTH secretion on the adrenocortical response following changes in dietary sodium and potassium intake. In ducks adapted to low-Na+/low-K+, high-Na+, and low-Na+ diets, stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) increased the aldosterone, but not the corticosterone, response to a level significantly greater than in the controls. These results demonstrate that in the duck secretion of corticosterone and aldosterone can be independently regulated. Furthermore, the endocrine changes that are induced by altered sodium and potassium intake are reflected in the adrenocortical responses to acute stress.
1221	3972087	Imprinting of the Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and dependence on exposure to light during ontogenesis.	Teuchert G, Kretschel A	Experientia	 1985 Mar 15;41(3):400-2	 doi: 101007/BF02004528	Embryos of Peking ducks were either incubated in complete darkness up t o hatching or were put into light one week before hatching. Control embryos were incubated under dim light conditions which corresponded broadly to the natural conditions. Under standardized imprinting conditions the controls and both groups of the light deprived ducklings showed the 'following response'. Most of the dark-incubated embryos, however, did not distinguish between imprinting and test objects of different shapes. Since most of the embryos kept in darkness only for 21 days also failed to develop the capacity for shape discrimination, there is apparently a critical period for light influences on the development of this capacity at some time during the early prenatal period.
1222	4077686	Structure and innervation of the tracheal muscles of the white Pekin duck.	Gopalakrishnakone P	J Anat	 1985 Mar;140 ( Pt 2):205-19		The sternotrachealis muscle of the duck, Anas platyrhynchos, was examined by light and electron microscopy. Muscle fibres showed succinic dehydrogenase activity but a definite classification based on this was not possible. Muscle contained fibres with features similar to mammalian slow muscle. Neuromuscular junctions showed the presynaptic portion containing clear vesicles and mitochondria, whereas the postjunctional muscle membrane was smooth without any junctional folds.
1223	3975499	Lung volume changes during respiration in ducks.	Jones JH, Effmann EL, Schmidt-Nielsen K	Respir Physiol	 1985 Jan;59(1):15-25	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(85)90014-3	The avian lung has been considered to be rigid and to remain isovolumetric during the respiratory cycle. We tested this hypothesis by implanting radiopaque markers of tantalum on the dorsal pulmonary surfaces and ventral pulmonary aponeuroses of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and measuring changes in lung thickness during the respiratory cycle using high speed cineradiography. We found small but regular changes in lung thickness that were synchronous with respiratory phase. Lung thickness was greatest at mid-inspiration (0.6% greater than mean) and least at mid-expiration (0.8% less than mean). Measurements made on ostrich (Struthio camelus) respiratory structures suggest that the maximal force that could be generated by the muscles (Mm. costopulmonales) at the margins of the ventral pulmonary aponeurosis is more than two orders of magnitude greater than would be required to resist pressure-induced changes in lung volume during respiration at rest. The action of these muscles could account for the very small magnitude of the volume changes measured during the respiratory cycle.
1224	3975498	Gas exchange during exercise in hypoxic ducks.	Kiley JP, Faraci FM, Fedde MR	Respir Physiol	 1985 Jan;59(1):105-15	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(85)90022-2	We quantitatively assessed pulmonary gas exchange in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) during running exercise (1.44 km X h-1 at 3 degrees incline) while the ducks spontaneously breathed either air (FIO2 = 0.21) or a hypoxic gas mixture (FIO2 = 0.12). During exercise, oxygen consumption increased 3 times above the resting value in normoxia and 3.6 times above rest in hypoxia. The convection requirement rose 34% and 20% in running normoxic and hypoxic ducks, respectively. The O2 extraction coefficient was the same in resting normoxic and hypoxic ducks (0.19 vs 0.18) and decreased by the same amount under exercise conditions (0.14 vs 0.15). Arterial PO2 was maintained during exercise in normoxia but increased slightly during exercise in hypoxia. Cardiac output increased by 73% and 111% during exercise in normoxic and hypoxic ducks, respectively. Calculations indicate that both the O2-diffusing capacity and the total conductance for O2 of the gas exchange system increased markedly during exercise in normoxia and hypoxia. We conclude that at this level of exercise, there was no apparent limitation to gas exchange in either the normoxic or hypoxic Pekin duck.
1225	2864178	Cardiovascular function in adrenalectomized Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Butler DG, Wilson JX	Comp Biochem Physiol A Comp Physiol	 1985;81(2):353-8	 doi: 101016/0300-9629(85)90147-1	Cardiovascular function was progressively impaired in Pekin ducks following surgical adrenalectomy. Diastolic and systolic arterial pressures (Pa) were respectively 45% and 28% lower in adrenalectomized (ADX) ducks than in sham-operated (SHAM) controls within 3 days after surgery. Adrenalectomy caused cardiac frequency (fH) to approximately double, diminished cardiac stroke volume, decreased body weight, and decreased plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, osmolal, Na and Cl concentrations. Adrenalectomy did not alter blood volume, hematocrit, or plasma concentrations of Ca and Mg. Administration of a synthetic glucocorticoid, betamethasone, prevented hypotension and prolonged the survival of ADX ducks. ADX and SHAM ducks maintained with betamethasone for up to 8 days did not differ in Pa, body weight, hematocrit, or plasma concentrations of Na and K. These experiments demonstrate the critical importance of glucocorticoid activity for blood pressure, Na and Cl regulation in birds.
1226	12891015	A Study On The Parasitic Helminths Of Domestic Duck(Anas Platyrhynchos Var. Domestica Linnaeus) In Korea.	Eom KS, Rim HJ, Jang DH	Kisaengchunghak Chapchi	 1984 Dec;22(2):215-221	 doi: 103347/kjp1984222215	During February 1982 to Septemner 1983, a total of 105 domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica Linnaeus) were collected from Ichon Gun, Puasn City, Chunchon City, Yanggu Gun, Taejeon City and unknown areas in Korea. In the results, six trematode and one nematode species of helminth parasites were obtained and described as follows: Amphimerus anatis Yamaguti, 1933, Echinostoma miyagawai Ishii, 1932, Echinochasmus japonicus Tanabe, 1926, Cryptocotyle sp., Notocotylus attenuatus (Rudolphi, 1809) Kossack, 1911, Apatemon sp, and nematode species, Heterakis gallinarum Schrank, 1788. From this collection, Amphimerus anatis Yamaguti, 1933, Echinochasmus japonicus Tanabe, 1926, Genus Cryptocotyle Luhe, 1899 and genus Apatemon Szidat, 1928 were firtstly recorded in Korea.
1227	6441338	Botulism of aquatic birds at the Stary u Pohorelic pond (Breclav District)	Hubalek Z, Hudec K, Neubauer M, Pellantova J	Vet Med (Praha)	 1984 Dec;29(12):747-52		In the years 1981 and 1982 when a mass mortality of wild and domestic water birds was observed on the Stary pond, eleven diseases or just died birds were examined by the neutralization test for botulotoxin and four sludge samples for the presence of Clostridium botulinum. C. Botulinum toxin of C type was detected in four wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) from September 1981 and July 1982 and in one gull (Larus ridibundus) and July 1982. The highest titres (of mice i. p. LD50/g) of botulotoxin in ducks were 10(6.3) in the intestinal contents, 10(6.1) in the liver tissue and 10(5.1) in the stomach contents. In one duck we detected, besides the C type, a smaller botulotoxin amount of A type. Therefore we can recommend a complete serotypifying for the cases of botulism in water birds. Out of four sludge samples collected in September 1982 one sample was negative, whereas in three samples the C botulotoxin was demonstrated after propagation and one C. botulinum strain of C type was isolated.
1228	6527779	The efferent connections of the nuclei of the descending trigeminal tract in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Arends JJ, Woelders-Blok A, Dubbeldam JL	Neuroscience	 1984 Nov;13(3):797-817	 doi: 101016/0306-4522(84)90097-6	The efferent and intranuclear connections of the nuclei of the descending trigeminal tract of the mallard have been studied with lesion methods, and by axonal transport techniques following injections of tritiated leucine, and of horseradish peroxidase. The large subnucleus oralis neurons, including those belonging to the nucleus of the ascending glossopharyngeal tract, have proven to be the sole origin of trigeminocerebellar connections. The cerebellar afferents are of the mossy fiber type, and terminate predominantly in lobules V, VI and VII, and possibly, lobule IV. Trigeminocerebellar projections are ipsilateral except for the vermal area. Subnucleus interpolaris is the main source of intratrigeminal fibers that terminate in subnucleus oralis and the ventral part of the main sensory nucleus. These intranuclear connections are bilateral, but the medium-celled caudal part of subnucleus interpolaris in particular contains the majority of bi- and/or contralaterally projecting neurons. Additionally, the small cells in the rostral part of subnucleus interpolaris project ipsilaterally upon the parabrachial region, and upon the lateral reticular formation. Projections upon the parabrachial region furthermore emanate bilaterally from layer I of the rostral subnucleus caudalis. A minor part of layer I neurons sends its axons contralaterally along with those of the dorsal column nuclei toward the thalamic nucleus dorsolateralis posterior. Associated with the medial lemniscus, contralateral termination is also present in the lateral part of the ventral lamella of oliva caudalis, in the marginal zone of nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsalis and immediately surrounding intercollicular grey and, finally, in the nucleus intercalatus thalami. Furthermore, a bilaterally descending projection from subnucleus caudalis upon layers I and II of the rostral cervical cord was observed. Close to their origin subnucleus caudalis neurons project upon the adjoining caudal part of the lateral reticular formation.
1229	6335576	The subnuclei and primary afferents of the descending trigeminal system in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Arends JJ, Dubbeldam JL	Neuroscience	 1984 Nov;13(3):781-95	 doi: 101016/0306-4522(84)90096-4	The descending trigeminal tract and its nuclei were described in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.). The borders of the system were established in Fink-Heimer preparations after unilateral lesions placed in the Gasserian ganglion using the distribution of degenerated particles as a criterion. Adjacent sections, stained with the Nissl, Kluver-Barrera and Haggqvist methods were used in the description of cyto- and fibroarchitecture of the descending trigeminal system and surrounding structures. Descending fibers of the trigeminal root could be traced from the sensory root, ventral to the main sensory nucleus, into the descending tract and its nuclei. Its fibers pass into the spinal cord, but not farther than the third cervical segment. Seven subdivisions (parts a-g) were recognized, but could be combined into four subnuclei, viz. in the terminology of Olszewski: subnucleus oralis containing parts a and b; subnucleus interpolaris parts c and d; subnucleus caudalis part f; dorsal horn part g, etc. No primary trigeminal fibers could be traced to structures outside the main sensory nucleus and nuclei of the descending trigeminal tract; all projections were ipsilateral with the exception of a slight bilateral projection caudal to the obex. Partial lesions in the Gasserian ganglion showed a distribution of the mandibular, maxillary and ophthalmic fibers from dorsal to ventral respectively in the subnuclei oralis and interpolaris, and from medial to lateral in the subnuclei caudalis and dorsal horn. Afferents from the petrosal ganglion project upon the medial part of subnucleus interpolaris and upon a small cell group (nucleus of the ascending glossopharyngeal tract) that may be functionally part of the subnucleus oralis. The subnucleus caudalis receives afferents from the jugular ganglion. These differences in afferentation are used in a tentative functional interpretation of the subdivisions of the nucleus of the descending trigeminal system.
1230	6150878	Comparative effects of somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 on basal growth hormone release and pancreatic function in immature ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Strosser MT, Harvey S, Foltzer C, Mialhe P	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1984 Nov;56(2):265-70	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(84)90040-6	The 30-min infusion of somatostatin (SRIF)-14 or SRIF-28 (800 ng/kg/min) in 7- to 8-week-old ducklings reduced the basal level of plasma growth hormone (GH). The magnitude of the GH suppression induced by SRIF-14 was similar to that elicited by SRIF-28. "Rebound" GH secretion was observed 30 min after infusion, the GH concentration being elevated above the basal level. The increase in GH secretion after SRIF-14 infusion was greater than that induced by SRIF-28. Plasma insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were similarly reduced after 10 and 30 min of SRIF-14 or SRIF-28 infusion. Following infusion the FFA levels returned to the pretreatment concentration, whereas the insulin concentration in both groups remained suppressed 30 min after infusion. The insulin level was still suppressed 60 min after SRIF-14 infusion, but not after SRIF-28 infusion. The infusion of SRIF-14 resulted in a marked, progressive increase in the glucagon concentration, which was reduced in birds infused with SRIF-28 and accompanied by hypoglycaemia. Following SRIF-28 infusion a "rebound" in the glucagon concentration occurred and remained elevated for at least 60 min. These results demonstrate comparative effects of SRIF-14 and SRIF-28 on the basal release of pituitary GH and pancreatic insulin and glucagon, and in particular they suggest that SRIF-28 is more potent in inhibiting pancreatic A cell activity.
1231	6521961	Conjugated catecholamines in birds.	Wilson JX	Neurosci Lett	 1984 Oct 26;51(3):337-40	 doi: 101016/0304-3940(84)90399-9	Large concentrations of dopamine (DA) glucuronide were measured in the plasma of chronically cannulated adult chickens (Gallus gallus), adult ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and 1-month-old ducklings. Glucuronides of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) also were present but at much lower concentrations. Sulfoconjugated DA, NE and E could be detected only in chickens. There were quantitative differences between chicken and duck catecholamine metabolism: (i) glucuronoconjugates and sulfoconjugates comprised large portions of the total DA, NE and E in chicken plasma; (ii) the predominant form of DA in duck plasma was DA glucuronide while most of the NE and E circulated in unconjugated (i.e. free) form. Catecholamine levels did not differ between adult and immature ducks. Angiotensin II injection into adult ducks elicited simultaneous increases in arterial blood pressure (Pa) and free NE but did not alter conjugated catecholamine levels.
1232	6441923	Chemoreflex drive of ventilation during exercise in ducks.	Faraci FM, Kiley JP, Fedde MR	Pflugers Arch	 1984 Oct;402(2):162-5	 doi: 101007/BF00583329	To determine if arterial chemoreceptors contribute to the ventilatory response during exercise, we measured minute ventilation (VI) in spontaneously breathing Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) during rest and running exercise when the inspired gas was switched from either 21% or 12% O2 to 100% O2 for 45 s (O2-test). In normoxia at rest (PaO2 = 99 Torr), inhaling 100% O2 reduced VI by 30%, while during resting hypoxic conditions (PaO2 = 56 Torr), 100% O2 inhalation reduced VI by 66%. During exercise, abruptly inhaling 100% O2 decreased VI by only 14% and 33% in normoxic and hypoxic conditions, respectively. Thus, only a small fraction of the ventilatory response during exercise under normoxic conditions is due to an arterial chemoreceptor input. However, during exercise in hypoxic conditions, arterial chemoreceptors provide a substantial portion of the total drive to ventilation.
1233	6099427	A survey of North American migratory waterfowl for duck plague (duck virus enteritis) virus.	Brand CJ, Docherty DE	J Wildl Dis	 1984 Oct;20(4):261-6	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-204261	A survey of migratory waterfowl for duck plague (DP) virus was conducted in the Mississippi and Central flyways during 1982 and in the Atlantic and Pacific flyways during 1983. Cloacal and pharyngeal swabs were collected from 3,169 migratory waterfowl in these four flyways, principally mallards (Anas platyrhynchos L.), black ducks (Anas rubripes Brewster), and pintails (Anas acuta L.). In addition 1,033 birds were sampled from areas of recurrent DP outbreaks among nonmigratory and captive waterfowl, and 590 from Lake Andes National Wildlife Refuge, the site of the only known major DP outbreak in migratory waterfowl. Duck plague virus was not found in any of the samples. Results support the hypothesis that DP is not established in North American migratory waterfowl as an enzootic disease.
1234	6092207	Dietary sodium and adrenocortical activity in ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and chickens (Gallus domesticus).	Radke WJ, Albasi CM, Harvey S	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1984 Oct;56(1):121-9	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(84)90068-6	Immature chickens and ducks were maintained on synthetic diets containing normal (0.4%), low (0.018%), or high (1.9%) sodium for 8 days, with freshwater available ad libitum. Food intake was similar in both species regardless of the diet but weight gain was depressed in birds fed the low-sodium diet. In both species the circulating aldosterone concentration was increased within 24 hr of dietary sodium depletion, although maximal levels were not attained until after 5 days. The magnitude of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH)-induced aldosterone secretion was also increased in sodium-deprived chickens and ducks. The basal aldosterone level was slightly suppressed by excess dietary sodium, which blunted the aldosterone response to exogenous ACTH. The transfer of chickens and ducks from low- to high-sodium regimes reduced the aldosterone levels (within 24 hr) to those in their respective controls. The transfer of birds from high- to low-sodium diets resulted in a prompt increase in the aldosterone concentration, although of reduced magnitude when compared with control birds transferred to low sodium. In both species alterations in the dietary sodium content had no effect on basal or ACTH-induced corticosterone secretion. The plasma prolactin levels in chickens were also unrelated to their sodium status. These results suggest that homeostatic adaptations in electrolyte balance during sodium depletion or excess are principally mediated by alterations in aldosterone secretion.
1235	6465351	Attenuated pulmonary pressor response to hypoxia in bar-headed geese.	Faraci FM, Kilgore DL Jr, Fedde MR	Am J Physiol	 1984 Aug;247(2 Pt 2):R402-3	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19842472R402	We determined the pulmonary pressor response during hypoxia in bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), a species that flies at altitudes up to 9,000 m, and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), a non-flyer. Mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure (PAP) and arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) were measured in unanesthetized birds acutely exposed to 21, 10, 5, and, in geese only, 4% O2. PAP in geese did not change as PaO2 was reduced from 95 to 46 Torr and rose only 3 mmHg when PaO2 was reduced to 28 Torr. The same PaO2 decline in ducks (99 to 29 Torr) resulted in an 11-mmHg rise in PAP. The data suggest that very little or no increase in pulmonary vascular resistance occurs in these geese during hypoxia. This bird may provide a unique model in which to study pulmonary vascular control mechanisms.
1236	6742237	Oxygen delivery to the heart and brain during hypoxia: Pekin duck vs. bar-headed goose.	Faraci FM, Kilgore DL Jr, Fedde MR	Am J Physiol	 1984 Jul;247(1 Pt 2):R69-75	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19842471R69	To investigate mechanisms that may allow birds to tolerate extreme high altitude, we acutely exposed unanesthetized bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) to 0.21, 0.10, and 0.05 inspired fractional concentrations of O2 (FIO2). In both birds, arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) was about 95 Torr at 0.21 FIO2, 45 Torr at 0.10 FIO2, and 28 Torr at 0.05 FIO2. Hyperventilation occurred at both levels of hypoxia, with PaCO2 decreasing to about 7 Torr at 28 Torr PaO2. At 28 Torr PaO2, arterial O2 content (CaO2) in geese (10.4 vol%) was significantly higher than in ducks (4.1 vol%). As PaO2 declined from about 95 to 28 Torr, both cerebral and coronary blood flow (determined by using the radioactive microsphere method) increased more than fivefold in ducks but less than threefold in geese. At both levels of hypoxia, O2 delivery (flow X CaO2) to the heart and brain of geese was the same as or higher than that of ducks. The unique control of cerebral and coronary O2 delivery exhibited by both species of birds may be related to their remarkable tolerance to severe hypocapnic hypoxia.
1237	6745632	Thyroid and adrenal responses of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) during saline adaptation.	Harvey S, Klandorf H, Radke WJ, Few JD	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1984 Jul;55(1):46-53	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(84)90127-8	Fresh water-reared Aylesbury ducklings were given 0.1 or 0.2 M NaCl drinking water and variations in the plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), corticosterone, and aldosterone were determined. Within 24 hr of being transferred to 0.2 M NaCl the corticosterone concentration was increased, whereas the levels of plasma T3 and aldosterone were reduced. The increase in corticosterone secretion persisted for at least 7 days, but the T3 and aldosterone concentrations had returned to control levels within 5 days. The concentrations of plasma aldosterone and T3 were similarly affected in birds transferred to 0.1 M NaCl, although corticosterone levels increased only after the birds were maintained on 0.1 M NaCl for 7 days. Plasma concentrations of T4 were increased in 1- to 2-week-old (but not 7-week-old) birds 7 days after their transfer to 0.1 and 0.2 M NaCl. In birds maintained on saline for 6 weeks the basal concentration of each hormone was not significantly different from that in fresh water-reared controls. When saline-reared birds were returned to freshwater conditions the plasma aldosterone and T3 concentrations were increased over a 5-day period. Transfer to saline consistently reduced body weight and food intake, whereas the transfer of saline-reared birds to fresh water stimulated body weight gain. Consequently, although these endocrine responses during saltwater adaptation might be expected to minimise the loss of body reserves and to facilitate the extra renal excretion of sodium, these alterations in endocrine function may be partly due to salt water-induced changes in food intake.
1238	6484318	Ventilatory and circulatory changes during cold exposure in the Pekin duck Anas platyrhynchos.	Bech C, Johansen K, Brent R, Nicol S	Respir Physiol	 1984 Jul;57(1):103-12	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(84)90036-7	Inspired ventilation (VI), O2 uptake (VO2), body temperature (TB), arterial blood pressure and arterio-venous differences in blood gases and pH were measured in ducks. Anas platyrhynchos, during exposure to variable ambient temperature (Ta) +20, 0 and -20 degrees C. A stable TB was maintained at all Ta's VO2 increased from 12.07 ml O2 (STPD) X kg-1 X min-1 at 20 degrees C to 28.95 ml O2 X kg-1 X min-1 at 20 degrees C. The ventilatory requirement (VI/VO2) changed from 0.468 L X mmol-1 at 20 degrees C to 0.322 L X mmol-1 at -20 degrees C corresponding to a change in overall O2-extraction from 28.5 to 41.4%. The increase in VI during cold exposure resulted from an increased tidal volume while breathing frequency was unchanged. This caused a smaller fraction of the total inspired air being dead space ventilation during cold exposure. The changed ventilatory requirement was largely the result of an increased parabronchial O2-extraction, whereas the altered ventilatory pattern accounted for a smaller part (21%) of the decreased ventilatory requirement. Arterial and venous O2 content and PaO2 changed little with cold exposure while PVO2 increased significantly. Calculated values for cardiac output increased from 173.7 ml X kg-1 X min-1 at +20 degrees C to 431.4 ml X kg-1 at -20 degrees C. From a thermoregulatory point of view it seems significant that the increased heat production during cold exposure is followed by an increased oxygen extraction in the lungs and in increased cardiac output, rather than by a further elevation of ventilation.
1239	6737616	An outbreak of botulism in waterfowl and fly larvae in New York State.	Shayegani M, Stone WB, Hannett GE	J Wildl Dis	 1984 Apr;20(2):86-9	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-20286	In October 1982 the death of approximately 1,500 wild ducks, mostly mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and about 100 shore birds including greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca) was observed in the New York State Oak Orchard Wildlife Management Area. The lack of gross pathology, the signs exhibited by the moribund ducks, and the ecologic conditions indicated possible botulinal intoxication. Clostridium botulinum toxin type C was demonstrated in duck serum (approximately 5 X 10(4) mouse intraperitoneal LD50 of toxin per ml of serum) and in an extract from fly larvae (Lucilia spp.) taken from the same area (approximately 1 X 10(6) mouse intraperitoneal LD50 of toxin per gram of larvae).
1240	6710528	Neurotoxic and teratogenic effects of an organophosphorus insecticide (phenyl phosphonothioic acid-O-ethyl-O-4-nitrophenyl] ester) on mallard development.	Hoffman DJ, Sileo L	Toxicol Appl Pharmacol	 1984 Apr;73(2):284-94	 doi: 101016/0041-008x(84)90334-x	Phenyl phosphonothioic acid-O-ethyl-O-[4-nitrophenyl] ester (EPN) is one of the 10 most frequently used organophosphorus insecticides and causes delayed neurotoxicity in adult chickens and mallards. Small amounts of organophosphorus insecticides placed on birds' eggs are embryotoxic and teratogenic. For this reason, the effects of topical egg application on EPN were examined on mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) embryo development. Mallard eggs were treated topically at 72 hr of incubation with 25 microliter of a nontoxic oil vehicle or with EPN in the vehicle at concentrations of approximately 12, 36, or 108 micrograms/g egg, equivalent to one, three, and nine times the agricultural level of application used to spray crops. Treatment with EPN resulted in 22 to 44% mortality over this dose range by 18 days of development compared with 4 and 5% for untreated and vehicle-treated controls. EPN impaired embryonic growth and was highly teratogenic: 37-42% of the surviving embryos at 18 days were abnormal with cervical and axial scoliosis as well as severe edema. Brain weights were significantly lower in EPN-treated groups at different stages of development including hatchlings. Brain neurotoxic esterase (NTE) activity was inhibited by as much as 91% at 11 days, 81% at 18 days, and 79% in hatchlings. Examination of brain NTE activity during the course of normal development revealed an increase of nearly sixfold from Day 11 through hatching. The most rapid increase occurred between Day 20 and hatching. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was inhibited by as much as 41% at 11 days, 47% at 18 days, and 20% in hatchlings. Plasma cholinesterase and alkaline phosphatase activities were inhibited and plasma aspartate aminotransferase activity was increased at one or more stages of development. Hatchlings from EPN-treated eggs were weaker and slower to right themselves. Histopathological examination did not reveal demyelination and axonopathy of the spinal cord that was characteristic of delayed neurotoxicity in adult birds.
1241	6429353	Susceptibility of pekin and muscovy ducks to Haemoproteus nettionis.	Sibley LD, Werner JK	J Wildl Dis	 1984 Apr;20(2):108-13	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-202108	Domestic muscovy (Caririna moschata) and pekin (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings were exposed to or injected with homogenates of Culicoides flies collected at White Pine, Michigan. Gametocytes of Haemoproteus nettionis were detected in both species of ducks at 16 days post-exposure. Culicoides downesi was indicated as a vector of H. nettionis in northern Michigan. Blood infections occurred with a higher prevalence and reached a higher intensity in muscovy ducks. Endogenous tissue stages of H. nettionis were located in endothelial cells of the lung and occasionally in the heart and spleen. Attempts to infect domestic ducklings by blood or tissue inoculations from wood ducks (Aix sponsa) infected with H. nettionis were not successful, even though schizonts of H. nettionis were seen in these wood ducks at necropsy. No morbidity or mortality was observed in any ducks infected with H. nettionis.
1242	6234053	Sensory receptors and their afferents in the caudal sympathetic nerve of the domestic duck.	Koley J, Sen Gupta J, Koley BN	Br Poult Sci	 1984 Apr;25(2):173-86	 doi: 101080/00071668408454856	The behavioural reactivity of the visceral receptors and their afferents in the caudal sympathetic nerve (part of synsacral sympathetic chain) of domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was studied using electrophysiological techniques to examine their involvement in different physiological functions. In total, 114 single unit activities were recorded from the caudal sympathetic nerve of duck. Receptors were classified according to location: in the anal sphincter (32 units), in the mucous membrane of the cloaca (45 units), at the branching point of the blood vessels over the rectum and adjacent mesentery (10 units), at the base of the feather follicles in and around the vent (17 units), and in the ventral and lateral lower abdominal wall muscle (10 units). Both spontaneous and non-spontaneous receptors responded to mechanical stimuli; average frequency of discharge of non-spontaneous units being much higher. Most of these receptors were of the rapidly-adapting type. Only some receptors in the abdominal muscle layer, anal sphincter and mucous membrane of hind gut were of the slowly-adapting type. Some of the latter responded to intraluminal distension pressure. Except for responses to succinylcholine chloride by receptors in the abdominal wall muscles and some units in the external anal sphincter, mechanosensitive receptors were not responsive to chemical stimuli. The discharge rate of the receptors at the base of the feather follicles varied according to the strength of stimulus. Conduction velocity of the caudal sympathetic afferent fibres ranged from 2.5 to 45 m/sec.
1243	6324446	Laboratory confirmed outbreaks of duck virus enteritis (duck plague) in the United Kingdom from 1977 to 1982.	Gough RE	Vet Rec	 1984 Mar 17;114(11):262-5	 doi: 101136/vr11411262	From 1977 to 1983 the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge confirmed 19 outbreaks of duck virus enteritis in the United Kingdom. All the outbreaks involved collections of captive waterfowl and there were no reported cases in commercial ducks. In many instances the disease was associated with contact with migrating waterfowl, particularly male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) and related species appeared to be particularly susceptible. The most sensitive system for isolating the virus was muscovy duck embryo tissue cultures. The duckling inoculation test was found to be the most reliable method of confirming the disease.
1244	6699217	Light and electron microscopic studies of the basilar papilla in the duck, Anas platyrhynchos. II. Embryonic development.	Chandler JP	J Comp Neurol	 1984 Feb 1;222(4):523-42	 doi: 101002/cne902220406	The intent of this study was to describe certain morphological aspects of cytodifferentiation of the basilar papilla in the duck, Anas platyrhynchos. The duck, with a longer incubation period than that of the chicken, has proven useful in identifying the earliest morphological changes during cyto-differentiation of the basilar papilla. Most of these changes occur first at the neural margin of the presumptive genu, at the site of initial contact by cochlear nerve fibers. A wave of differentiation of hair cells radiates abneurally, proximally, and distally, concurrent with the establishment of afferent innervation. Extracellular channels form in the papilla between cell bases just before the nerve fibers penetrate the basal lamina. Nerve fibers abut hair cell bases in the genu at the time the hair cells separate from the basal lamina on day 9. Hair cell bases contain granular vesicles and lie among the nuclei of supporting cells on day 10. Synaptic bodies are present opposite nerve endings on day 11. Efferent nerve endings appear on short hair cells in the genu on day 15 and on tall hair cells on day 17.
1245	6699216	Light and electron microscopic studies of the basilar papilla in the duck, Anas platyrhynchos. I. The hatchling.	Chandler JP	J Comp Neurol	 1984 Feb 1;222(4):506-22	 doi: 101002/cne902220405	The intent of this study was to describe in detail the normal structure of the basilar papilla in the duck, Anas platyrhynchos, with light and electron microscopy. The cochlear duct is supported by a ring of dense periotic connective tissue, the limbus. Distribution of hair cells in the basilar papilla follows the general avian pattern. Tall hair cells occupy the neural margin of the papilla. Short hair cells cover the abneural margin from the proximal tip to the middistal area. Intermediate hair cells form a transition zone from genu to distal tip. Patterns of innervation are correlated with hair cell morphology, which supports the classification of hair cells in birds into three groups. Tall hair cells synapse with two to four large afferents and one efferent; intermediate hair cells synapse with one or two afferents and one or two efferents; short hair cells synapse with one small afferent and one or two large efferents. In this relatively primitive species of bird, cuticles in all classes of hair cells reach the plasmalemma on the neural side of the cell, a condition that supports the contention that tall hair cells are more primitive than short hair cells.
1246	6424873	Effect of bipiperidyl mustard and gold thioglucose on the hypothalamus and growth of the hatchling chick and duckling.	Hopper DL, Satterlee DG	Br Poult Sci	 1984 Jan;25(1):77-82	 doi: 101080/13632758408454844	Following a 48 h fasting period after hatching, male Cobb broiler chicks were injected with either bipiperidyl mustard (intraperitoneally; 0.01 and 0.02 mg/g body weight) or goldthioglucose (intracardially; 0.25 mg/g body weight). The influence of these obesifying agents on growth was compared to control injections of physiological saline. Bi-weekly body weights, and eight week live, carcass, and abdominal fat plus carcass weights were depressed in chicks injected with bipiperidyl mustard, the depression being significant for eight-week abdominal fat weights. In birds injected with gold thioglucose all weights were significantly depressed. In a separate investigation, histological evidence of generalised hypothalmic lesions was observed in both chicks (Gallus domesticus) and ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) injected with bipiperidyl mustard or gold thioglucose. Similar lesions were absent in control chicks and ducklings. The possibility of the existence of a sex-steroid-mediated endorphinergic-glucostatic mechanism for appetite regulation in birds is discussed.
1247	6370453	Ependymal and neuronal specializations in the lateral ventricle of the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Korf HW, Fahrenkrug J	Cell Tissue Res	 1984;236(1):217-27	 doi: 101007/BF00216534	The lateral ventricles of the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos, display characteristic ependymal and hypendymal specializations. Adjacent to the nucleus accumbens and the basal pole of the lateral septum the ventricular surface shows a highly folded pattern either with protrusions into the ventricular lumen or deep invaginations into the brain tissue. These medial and basal ependymal folds are found exclusively in a circumscribed region extending over a range of 600 micron in the rostrocaudal direction. Ependymal folds occurring in the lateral wall of the ventricles were traced up to the level of the interventricular foramen. Numerous capillaries are observed in the subependymal layer of these folds. By means of immunocytochemistry with antibodies against chicken vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) an aggregation of classical cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons is shown in the region of the nucleus accumbens and the lateral septum. These neurons are closely related to the ependymal folds. Additional VIP-immunoreactive neurons are scattered in deeper layers of the lateral septum and the nucleus accumbens. The latter are richly innervated by VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibers. The results of the present study are discussed with particular reference to the hypothesis of Kuenzel and van Tienhoven (1982) that ependymal specializations demonstrated in the lateral ventricles of the domestic fowl might represent a new circumventricular organ ("lateral septal organ").
1248	6146483	Effect of DDE on the Ca metabolism of the duck eggshell gland and its subcellular fractions; relation to the functional stage.	Lundholm CE	Comp Biochem Physiol C Comp Pharmacol Toxicol	 1984;78(1):5-12	 doi: 101016/0742-8413(84)90039-2	Administration of DDE to Indian Runner ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var.) reduced the eggshell index by 28% and the calcium content of the secreted fluid in the shell gland by 25%. DDE inhibited the functional decrease of the calcium content of the gland cells that occurred during eggshell formation. DDE reduced the functional increase in the ATP-dependent binding of Ca2+ to a microsomal subfraction FIII prepared from Ca-secreting glands forming an eggshell. In subfraction FI the Ca2+ binding was decreased by DDE even when the gland contained a mature shell. FIII probably contained calcium-secreting granules, whereas FI contained plasma membrane fragments of the gland cells.
1249	6641666	Effects of dietary cadmium on mallard ducklings.	Cain BW, Sileo L, Franson JC, Moore J	Environ Res	 1983 Dec;32(2):286-97	 doi: 101016/0013-9351(83)90112-3	Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings were fed cadmium in the diet at 0, 5, 10, or 20 ppm from 1 day of age until 12 weeks of age. At 4-week intervals six males and six females from each dietary group were randomly selected, bled by jugular venipuncture, and necropsied. Significant decreases in packed cell volume (PCV) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and a significant increase in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were found at 8 weeks of age in ducklings fed 20 ppm cadmium. Mild to severe kidney lesions were evident in ducklings fed 20 ppm cadmium for 12 weeks. No other blood chemistry measurement, hematological parameter, or tissue histopathological measurement indicated a reaction to cadmium ingestion. Body weight, liver weight, and the ratio of the femur weight to length were not affected by dietary cadmium. Femur cadmium concentration in all ducklings 12 weeks of age declined from the values detected at 4 and 8 weeks of age. Liver cadmium concentrations were significantly higher in relation to the increased dietary levels and in relation to the length of time the ducklings were fed the cadmium diets. At 12 weeks of age the cadmium concentration in liver tissue was twice that in the diet.
1250	6140839	Type A influenza virus strains isolated from free living ducks in Czechoslovakia during 1978-1981.	Turek R, Tumova B, Mucha V, Stumpa A	Acta Virol	 1983 Nov;27(6):523-7		Eight influenza virus A strains were isolated from 269 cloacal swabs taken from wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), shot during their autumn migrations in the years 1978-1981. One strain was identified as subtype A-H3N8N6 (Hav7Neq2Nav1), the remaining seven as subtype A-H4N6 (Hav4Nav1).
1251	6643753	Viraemia and antibody response of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) to infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus.	van Tongeren HA	J Comp Pathol	 1983 Oct;93(4):521-30	 doi: 101016/0021-9975(83)90058-0	The course and intensity of viraemia after experimental infection with a TBE virus was studied in mallards of varying age and weight. Although virus titres in the blood can range from log102.65 to log104.85, in general these titres are believed to be of sufficient magnitude to infect ticks with the virus. Neutralizing antibodies in the serum of ducks are long-lasting and of sufficient titre to prevent a second viraemia. That mallards can play a role in the epidemiology of TBE virus is likely. Although some ducklings died in unexplained circumstances, none of the infected mallards showed overt disease.
1252	6885480	Biological elimination rates of radioisotopes by mallards contaminated at a liquid radioactive waste disposal area.	Halford DK, Markham OD, White GC	Health Phys	 1983 Sep;45(3):745-56	 doi: 101097/00004032-198309000-00016	The biological elimination of nine gamma-emitting radioisotopes was studied in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) which were released onto liquid radioactive waste pounds in southeastern Idaho. After 68, 75 or 145 days, the ducks were removed from the contaminated environment and placed in metabolic cages. Whole-body and feces-urine counts were made for 51 days and then the ducks were sacrificed and dissected for tissue analyses. The biological elimination of radioisotopes were fit to two compartment models using non-linear least squares estimation. Fecal-urine data substantiated two-compartment elimination of all radionuclides. Biological half-lives in mallards were 10 days (131I), 22 days (140Ba), 86 days (51Cr), 32 days (58Co), 26 days (75Se), 67 days (65Zn), 10 days (134Cs), 67 days (60Co) and 11 days (137Cs). Body burdens in ducks were at 90% of equilibrium with the radioactive waste pond water at the time of removal from the waste ponds. Tissue distribution of radionuclides on the day of removal from the ponds showed gut to have the highest concentrations followed by feather, liver and muscle. After 51 days in metabolic cages, feather had the greatest radionuclide concentrations followed by liver, muscle and gut. Liver contained the greatest variety of radionuclides and muscle the smallest. Biological elimination rates for the major dose-contributing nuclides (134Cs and 137Cs) to humans consuming contaminated waterfowl tissue indicate that the dose to man could be reduced substantially due to the rapid elimination of these radionuclides by mallards. Contaminated waterfowl would receive most of the internal dose in the first month after leaving the contaminated environment indicating that long-term doses would be inconsequential.
1253	6414880	Catecholamine-mediated pressor responses to angiotensin II in the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Wilson JX, Butler DG	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1983 Sep;51(3):477-89	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(83)90065-5	Asp1,Val5-angiotensin II (AII) caused dose-dependent increases in aortic blood pressure (BP) when injected into anesthetized Pekin ducks. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) concentrations in arterial plasma were found to be elevated 1 min after injection of AII, when BP was peaking, while plasma levels of unconjugated dopamine (DA) did not undergo any consistent change. Pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rendered ducks supersensitive to the pressor effect of injections of NE, but did not affect adrenal chromaffin cell granulation, plasma NE and E concentrations, or pressor responses to tyramine and AII. Depletion of endogenous NE and E stores, following treatment with reserpine, did not affect pressor responses to NE, but diminished pressor responses to tyramine and AII. The discrepancies in the responses of 6-OHDA-treated ducks and reserpinized ducks to exogenous NE and AII indicate different pressor mechanisms for the two hormones. It is suggested that mobilization of endogenous NE and E contributes to the rise in BP observed following AII injection.
1254	6618932	Influence of ischemia and hypoxia on breathing in ducks.	Lillo RS, Jones DR	J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol	 1983 Aug;55(2):400-8	 doi: 101152/jappl1983552400	We examined the influence of whole and lower body hypoxia and lower body ischemia on breathing in White Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, excluding pathways involving the carotid bodies. Carotid body denervated birds breathing 10 or 5% O2 developed a tachypnea after a latency of 30-100 s. The tachypnea was more pronounced with the more severe hypoxia, resulting in almost a doubling of minute ventilation (VE). Occlusion of the abdominal aorta in unanesthetized ducks produced immediate development of hypertension. Ventilation was unaffected for the 1st min; a tachypnea then developed rapidly and persisted for the duration of the occlusion resulting in a 25% increase in VE. After thoracic spinal section, all ventilatory responses to occlusion were eliminated. Experimental perfusion of the brain and single intact carotid body in unanesthetized ducks with hyperoxic blood during low O2 breathing (6-9% O2) resulted in tachypnea, also after a considerable latency. These results suggest that severe hypoxia can affect breathing in birds via pathways other than those involving the carotid bodies.
1255	6644918	Vertebrate host specificity and experimental vectors of Plasmodium (Novyella) kempi sp. n. from the eastern wild turkey in Iowa.	Christensen BM, Barnes HJ, Rowley WA	J Wildl Dis	 1983 Jul;19(3):204-13	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-193204	Vertebrate host specificity, experimental laboratory vectors, and a description of Plasmodium (Novyella) kempi sp. n. from eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris Vieillot) in Iowa are presented. Plasmodium kempi is infective for domestic turkeys, bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), chukars (Alectoris graeca), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), peacocks (Pavo cristatus), and canaries (Serinus canaria), produces a transient infection in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and domestic geese (Anser anser), but will not infect ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), pigeons (Columba livia), Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix), leghorn white chickens (Gallus gallus), or starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Oocysts and (or) sporozoites were recovered from 68% (84/124) and 98% (60/61) of the Culex pipiens pipiens and C. tarsalis examined, respectively. Oocysts developed faster and sporozoites invaded the salivary glands sooner in C. tarsalis (6 days) than in C. p. pipiens (7 days). Culex tarsalis transmitted P. kempi more effectively than C. p. pipiens, although both species were capable of transmitting the parasite by natural feeding. Oocysts developed and sporozoites also were produced in C. restuans, but its ability to transmit the parasite was not determined. Aedes aegypti (Rockefeller strain) and A. triseriatus were refractive to P. kempi. Plasmodium kempi produces trophozoites with large refractile globules and fine cytoplasmic extensions, mature schizonts in the form of a condensed fan containing four to eight nuclei (usually 5), and elongate gametocytes with irregular borders. All stages are confined almost exclusively to mature erythrocytes, with no effect on host cell size or position of host cell nucleus. Plasmodium kempi is most similar morphologically to P. (Novyella) hexamerium and P. (Novyella) vaughani. It differs from P. hexamerium in having large refractile globules in trophozoites and immature schizonts, an inability to infect starlings, an absence of phanerozoites in capillary endothelium of the brain, and the ability to develop in C. pipiens mosquitoes. Plasmodium kempi is more like P. vaughani morphologically, but differs by infecting turkeys and ducks (transient), by its inability to infect starlings, its lack of morphological variation even when in different hosts, and its ability to develop in C. pipiens and C. tarsalis.
1256	6627087	Further studies on the corticosteroid-receptor system of the nasal gland of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Sandor T, Mehdi AZ, DiBattista JA	Can J Biochem Cell Biol	 1983 Jul;61(7):731-43	 doi: 101139/o83-092	The interaction of tritiated corticosterone with the nasal gland corticosterone receptor was investigated. Kinetic studies have shown that the association of [3H]corticosterone-receptor followed second-order reaction kinetics and the dissociation of the ligand from the receptor became "pseudo" first order in the presence of large excess of radioinert steroids at 0, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C. Similar data were obtained with an ammonium sulfate precipitate of the cytosol. Dissociation rate constants varied from 10(-5) to 10(-3) s-1 and the association rate constants varied from 0.5 X 10(4) to 3.8 X 10(5) M-1 X s-1, depending on the reaction temperature and the cytoplasmic receptor preparation. Equilibrium dissociation constants were in 10(-8)-10(-9) M range. Equilibrium dissociation constants, calculated from kinetic data (kd/ka), showed a marked temperature dependence, while those obtained by saturation analysis varied much less with the reaction temperature. Data obtained in these experiments were used to calculate some thermodynamic parameters of the binding of corticosterone to the cytoplasmic receptor. The enthalpy of dissociation was 101.5 and 79.4 kJ X mol-1 and the entropy of dissociation was 200 and 280 J X mol-1 X degree-1 for the crude cytoplasmic receptor and the ammonium sulfate precipitate, respectively. From the equilibrium dissociation constants, the enthalpy and entropy of the equilibrium binding was calculated. Polynomial fitting of Ka values versus 1/T yielded enthalpy (delta H) values from -0.9 to -88.8 kJ X mol-1, depending on the nature of the receptor preparation. Entropy values were negative for kinetically derived equilibrium association constants from the crude cytosol at all temperatures and for 0 and 15 degrees C for the precipitate. Entropy values were positive for Ka values obtained from kinetic rates at 25 and 35 degrees C and for Ka's calculated from saturation analysis. Further experiments with the precipitate confirmed our previous contention that the nasal gland cytoplasmic corticosterone receptor metabolized the bound ligand to 11-dehydrocorticosterone, though the receptor preparation was corticosterone specific. The following hydrodynamic parameters were obtained on the binding macromolecule: molecular weight, 316 000; S20W, 8.0; Stokes radius (rs), 77.3 A (1 A equal to 0.1 nm); total frictional ratio (f/f0), 1.71. The labeled receptor preparation translocated to homologous nuclear binding sites following heat activation and, at the nuclear binding sites, the ligand was almost exclusively in its oxidized form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1257	6884992	The amino-acid sequence of Northern Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) hemoglobin.	Godovac-Zimmermann J, Braunitzer G	Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem	 1983 Jun;364(6):665-74	 doi: 101515/bchm219833641665	The complete amino-acid sequence of the major hemoglobin component (HbA) of the adult Northern Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) is presented. A minor component HbD was also detected but in low concentrations. The sequences of alpha A- and beta-chains were established by automatic Edman degradation on tryptic peptides and peptides obtained by specific chemical cleavages. The alignment of the peptides was performed by comparison with the alpha A- and beta-chains of Greylag Goose hemoglobin (Anser anser). Thereby an exchange of five positions in the alpha A-chains and three in the beta-chains was observed. No exchanges were found in the surroundings of the heme, in alpha 1 beta 2-contact points, or allosteric regulatory sites. In the alpha 1 beta 1-subunit interface one amino-acid residue in alpha A-chains and one in beta-chains are exchanged. By comparison with the amino-acid sequence derived from globin genes of Domestic Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), the alpha A-chains differ by two exchanges in the N-terminal region and the beta-chains by five exchanges the in C-terminal region. The comparison of the amino-acid sequence derived from alpha A-globin gene of the Moscovy Duck (Cairina moschata) and alpha A-chains of the Northern Mallard, shows only one replacement.
1258	6873485	Alarm call responsivity of mallard ducklings: II. Perceptual specificity along an acoustical dimension affecting behavioral inhibition.	Miller DB	Dev Psychobiol	 1983 May;16(3):195-205	 doi: 101002/dev420160306	Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal and locomotor behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call. An important acoustic feature of the call that affects such inhibition is the slow repetition rate of the notes. This study assesses the range of repetition rates that affect behavioral inhibition in 1-day-old domestic mallard (Peking) ducklings. Four hundred and fifty maternally naive ducklings were tested in groups of 30 to repetition rates ranging from .2 to 3.0 notes/sec in 2/10-sec increments. Various behavioral measures (i.e., incidence of inhibition, latency and duration of inhibition) revealed that the optimal range of repetition rates affecting inhibition extends from .8 to 1.8 notes/sec. Within this range, 1.0 and 1.6 notes/sec are particularly effective. The efficacy of these particular 2 rates may reflect their correspondence with the rates of the modal alarm call and certain kinds of self-produced embryonic vocalizations, respectively. Unexpectedly, very slow repetition rates (.2 and .4 notes/sec) are not as effective as faster rates in promoting inhibition. Thus, the inhibitory response exhibited by ducklings upon hearing the alarm call reflects auditory perceptual specificity to a range of moderately slow repetition rates that are characteristic of normally occurring sounds of the perinatal environment.
1259	6887447	Avian botulism during late autumn and early spring in Saskatchewan.	Wobeser G, Rainnie DJ, Smith-Windsor TB, Bogdan G	J Wildl Dis	 1983 Apr;19(2):90-4	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-19290	Two outbreaks of botulism in central Saskatchewan in which mortality of waterfowl continued into late autumn and then recurred in the same marshes the following spring are described. Small numbers of birds were involved in each instance. Dabbling ducks (predominantly mallards, Anas platyrhynchos and pintails, Anas acuta) and American coots, Fulica americana were affected most commonly in autumn, whereas only diving ducks (predominantly lesser scaup, Aythya affinis) were found to be involved in spring. Live maggots present in carcasses despite sub-freezing temperatures were the probable source of intoxication in the autumn; the source of toxin in the spring was not determined.
1260	6883185	Subacute toxic effects of dietary T-2 toxin in young mallard ducks.	Hayes MA, Wobeser GA	Can J Comp Med	 1983 Apr;47(2):180-7		Young Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed diets containing purified T-2 toxin at levels of 20 or 30 ppm for two or three weeks. Ingestion of T-2 toxin was associated with reduced weight gain and delayed development of adult plumage. Affected ducks developed caseonecrotic plaques throughout the upper alimentary tract, especially in oropharynx and ventriculus. Several ducks also developed severe ulcerative, proliferative esophagitis and proventriculitis. Generalized atrophy of all lymphoid tissues consistently occurred. The manifestations of T-2 mycotoxicosis in Mallard ducks were mostly attributable to irritant toxicity to the alimentary mucosa. The T-2 toxin caused neither hematopoietic suppression nor a hemorrhagic syndrome in ducks. These alimentary lesions of T-2 mycotoxicosis in ducks do not resemble diseases of native waterfowl presently being recognized in routine surveillance of waterfowl mortality in Saskatchewan.
1261	6310168	The influence of seven environmental and physiological factors on duck plague virus shedding by carrier mallards.	Burgess EC, Yuill TM	J Wildl Dis	 1983 Apr;19(2):77-81	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-19277	Duck plague (DP) carrier mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were subjected to seven environmental and physiological conditions in an attempt to stimulate DP virus shedding. The conditions were: food quality, social interaction, reproductive state, time dependency of food and water, noise, exercise, and sex of bird. Cloacal and oral swabs were taken daily for 10 days and assayed for DP virus content. The stimulated carrier ducks shed DP virus intermittently in amounts up to 10(8) ffus/swab/day (the highest 10-fold dilution still showing specific fluorescence). Unstimulated DP carrier ducks shed only up to 10(3) ffus/swab/day. Reproductive state and exercise were the only two factors that acted in concert to stimulate the shedding of virus in oral secretions.
1262	6340745	Serum levels of luteinizing hormone, prolactin, estradiol and progesterone in laying and nonlaying mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Bluhm CK, Phillips RE, Burke WH	Biol Reprod	 1983 Mar;28(2):295-305	 doi: 101095/biolreprod282295	Temporal changes of circulating serum hormones were measured to compare the reproductive endocrinology of laying and nonlaying mallards. In this study all sixteen control mallards left with their mates laid eggs, while only one of sixteen mallards stressed by daily movement into new pens, laid eggs. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in stressed nonlaying mallards than in laying mallards over the 7-week period. Within 1 week of the rotation treatment, LH concentrations in stressed mallards averaged (means +/- SEM) 2.72 +/- 0.19 ng/ml and were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than LH levels in the controls (3.62 +/- 0.18 ng/ml). After 7 weeks, injections of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) induced a greater change in circulating LH levels in stressed mallards (2.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) than in breeding control mallards (0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml). These data demonstrate that the lack of reproduction in stressed mallards was associated with LHRH-sensitive pituitary pools of LH, despite their low concentrations of serum LH. These data suggest that the block in reproduction is a failure of the hypothalamus to produce or release releasing hormones. The serum hormone levels of the control mallards varied temporally with stages in the nesting cycle. LH levels increased with the onset of nesting activity, and showed marked fluctuations during the laying period. LH levels fell at the onset of incubation but increased after loss of clutch. Estradiol levels were highest prior to the laying of the first egg and their peak coincided with the initial nest building behavior of the females. Progesterone levels increased sharply with the laying of the 2nd-4th eggs, decreased sharply with the laying of the 6th egg, and then increased slightly at the end of the nesting cycle. Prolactin levels were initially low but gradually increased with laying and incubation activity, declined with loss of clutch, and increased again with renesting activity. Prolactin levels in the stressed mallards also increased (P less than 0.01) over the 7-week period, but significantly less (P less than 0.05) than in layers.
1263	6301937	Habituation of the corticosterone response of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) to daily treadmill exercise.	Rees A, Harvey S, Phillips JG	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1983 Mar;49(3):485-9	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(83)90212-5	The habituation of the corticosterone response of ducks to treadmill exercise (1.1 km/hr 0 degrees incline for 60 min) has been determined over a 28-day period. In untrained birds 30 min of treadmill exercise resulted in a marked (P less than 0.001) increase in the basal plasma corticosterone level. After 60 min of exercise the corticosterone concentration remained elevated (P less than 0.001) in comparison with basal and control (nonexercised) levels but was less (P less than 0.01) than that at 30 min. Following exercise the concentration declined to basal levels within 60 min. After 7 days of daily training the peak (30 min) corticosterone response to exercise diminished by greater than 50% and was absent in birds trained for 21 days. This habituation of the corticosterone response may be due to adrenocortical stimulation by pituitary adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) being reduced. As the stimulatory effect of ACTH administration (8 IU/kg) on corticosterone secretion does not habituate in birds treated daily (for 28 days), the reduced corticosterone response to exercise may be due to decreased ACTH release rather than to a reduction in adrenal ACTH sensitivity.
1264	6840521	Factors affecting prolactin secretion during breeding and incubation in the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Hall MR, Goldsmith AR	Gen Comp Endocrinol	 1983 Feb;49(2):270-6	 doi: 101016/0016-6480(83)90144-2	The plasma concentrations of prolactin were measured by radioimmunoassay throughout the breeding cycle in female domestic ducks. Prolactin levels increased significantly during egg laying from 5 to 15 ng/ml and again at the start of incubation to about 28 ng/ml. Prolactin levels remained consistently high throughout incubation and fell sharply around the time the eggs hatched. Local anaesthesia of the incubation patches of incubating females for 9 hr caused a significant decrease in plasma prolactin. It is suggested that tactile stimulation from the eggs in the nest may cause the rise in prolactin during the egg laying period and also maintain prolactin secretion during incubation.
1265	6293806	Adrenalectomy inhibits noradrenergic, adrenergic, and vasopressor responses to angiotensin II in the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Wilson JX, Butler DG	Endocrinology	 1983 Feb;112(2):645-52	 doi: 101210/endo-112-2-645	The iv injection of Asp1, Val5-angiotensin II(AII) was followed by increases in arterial plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) concentrations and elevation of arterial blood pressure in the anesthetized Pekin duck. AII injection did not affect the concentration of unconjugated dopamine in arterial plasma. Adrenalectomy inhibited the increases in plasma NE and E concentrations elicited by AII. Pressor responses to AII also were diminished after adrenalectomy, whereas pressor responses to exogenous NE and tyramine were not measurably affected. The alpha-adrenergic blocking drug phenoxybenzamine diminished the pressor effect of AII in both shamoperated and adrenalectomized ducks. The blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors by phenoxybenzamine was incomplete, since pressor responses to exogenous NE were lessened by not abolished. We conclude from these experiments that AII increases arterial blood pressure in the Pekin duck by mobilizing NE and E from both adrenal and extraadrenal stores. It remains unknown whether the residual pressor response to AII in phenoxybenzamine-treated, adrenalectomized ducks involves an alpha-adrenergic mechanism.
1266	6184217	6-Hydroxydopamine treatment diminishes noradrenergic and pressor responses to angiotensin II in adrenalectomized ducks.	Wilson JX, Butler DG	Endocrinology	 1983 Feb;112(2):653-8	 doi: 101210/endo-112-2-653	The extent to which the vasopressor action of angiotensin II (AII) in birds depends upon the sympathetic nervous system in not known. Therefore, we have tested whether the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) mediates the residual vasopressor response to AII in adrenalectomized ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) inhibited by up to 100% the pressor effect of exogenous AII in anesthetized adrenalectomized ducks. After high doses of AII, a transient drop in blood pressure (BP) often preceded or supplanted the pressor response. Systolic BP responses to injections of tyramine also were decreased by 6-OHDA, but responses to NE were increased (diastolic BP) or not affected significantly (systolic BP). Inhibition with SQ20881 of converting enzyme, to decrease endogenous production of AII, reduced pressor responses to AI, but did not affect either baseline BP or responses to AII. Thus, the diminished responsiveness to AII in these catecholamine-depleted ducks was not due to competition from endogeneous AII. Furthermore, the increases in plasma NE and E concentrations that normally follow AII injection were abolished by adrenalectomy and 6-OHDA treatment. The coincident extinction of both cathecholamine and vasopressor responses comprises new evidence that AII raises BP in the Pekin duck by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. The vasopressor response is mediated by extraadrenal as well as adrenal sources of NE.
1267	6847608	Hydrophobic chromatography of proteins in urea solutions. The separation of apoproteins from a lipoprotein of avian egg yolk.	Burley RW, Sleigh RW	Biochem J	 1983 Jan 1;209(1):143-50	 doi: 101042/bj2090143	A method is described for the chromatographic separation of mixtures of egg-yolk proteins of low solubility by using a hydrophobic column (phenyl-Sepharose) and eluting with increasing concentrations of aqueous urea at low pH. The resolving power of the method was established by tests on proteins and protein fragments of known sequence. The theoretical basis for the method remains, however, unclear. Factors such as the aggregation of the protein often appeared to be more important than its hydrophobicity in determining the urea concentration needed for elution. The method was applied to the mixture of apoproteins from the low-density lipoprotein (density about 0.95 g/ml) of avian egg yolk. For the previously studied apoproteins from egg yolk of the hen (Gallus domesticus), hydrophobic chromatography provided a new and convenient method for isolating the main apoproteins (hen apovitellenins I-VI). For the hitherto unexplored apoproteins from egg yolk of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) the method has now been used to isolate three new proteins, two of which were not readily separated by methods based on molecular size. The elution pattern obtained with duck egg-yolk apoproteins is not the same as that of the hen egg-yolk apoproteins, although we suggest a relationship for the three new apoproteins based on their amino acid compositions and other properties. Possible roles for the apoproteins in avian egg yolk are described.

Halvorson D, Karunakaran D, Senne D, Kelleher C, Bailey C, Abraham A, Hinshaw V, Newman J	Avian Dis	 1983 Jan-Mar;27(1):77-85		Isolation-reared mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were placed on ponds in turkey-rearing areas in Minnesota, and their cloacae were periodically swabbed to attempt isolating virus from embryonated chicken eggs. Nearby turkeys were sampled by taking cloacal and tracheal swabs as well as blood samples. Hemagglutinating viruses were identified at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Ames, Iowa. During this two-year study, the weekly influenza virus-isolation rate from ducks varied from 0 to 24.4%. A total of 213 influenza viruses were isolated from the ducks. Twenty-six influenza virus subtypes were detected. Ninety-seven flocks of turkeys were diagnosed as having influenza by virus isolation and/or serology. Eight influenza virus subtypes were involved in the turkey outbreaks, and seven of these were also detected in the ducks and/or other avian species. The weekly infection rate of the sentinel ducks correlated directly with observations of wild ducks at the monitoring sites. Influenza virus was isolated from water samples collected near the sentinel duck sites during the study.
1269	6614742	Gymnophallus rebecqui n. sp. (syn. Parvatrema sp. 1, J. Rebecq, 1964) (Digenea: Gymnophallidae), an intestinal parasite of ducks from Camargue (France)	Bartoli P	Ann Parasitol Hum Comp	 1983;58(3):211-25	 doi: 101051/parasite/1983583211	Gymnophallus rebecqui n. sp. replace Parvatrema sp. 1 J. Rebecq, 1964. Metacercariae are described. They occur free in the extrapallial space of Cerastoderma glaucum and Abra ovata, at the central part of the valves. Pallial epithelium hypertrophy is induced by metacercariae and damages are produced at the inner face of the shell of Abra ovata. Adults have been reared in laboratory hosts (Aythya ferina, A. fuligula, Anas platyrhynchos, Tadorna tadorna and Larus argentatus michaellis). Natural adults have been discovered in the anterior and median gut of Aythya ferina, A. fuligula and Anas clypeata. Adults are described and compared with other related Gymnophallid species. This new species is not a member of Parvatrema but belongs to Gymnophallus genera.
1270	6412417	Cytogenetic studies in domestic chickens and ducks	Lemakova S	Vet Med (Praha)	 1983;28(6):347-50		Typology and the number of chromosomes were studied in two species of domestic poultry: the domestic fowl (Gallus domesticus) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). The classical method, described by Konstantinov and Dobriyanov (1974), used in the trails, enabled typology only in the largest chromosomes. In the remaining microchromosomes the position of centromere was not determined. Microchromosomes appeared as points which were arranged by size in caryotypes. The domestic fowl had 78 chromosomes on the whole and the duck 80 chromosomes.
1271	6407178	Distribution of cestodes among domestic ducks and free-living aquatic birds	Valkounova J	Vet Med (Praha)	 1983;28(4):231-47		In 1959-1975, 3404 water birds of 18 species belonging to six orders were examined for the presence of cestodes. The birds came from 52 localities (ponds) in Bohemia and Moravia where domestic ducks were kept by the State Fishery and where also wild water fowl occurred. Cestodes of 31 species of the families Hymenolepididae, Dilepididae, Amabiliidae and Diploposthidae were found. The total number of examined birds included 2476 domestic ducks (1406 of them, i. e. 56.8%, were positive for cestodes) and 928 free-living water birds (873 of them, i. e. 94.1%, were 30 cestode species. Eight free-living bird species of the orders Anseriformes and Ralliformes (Anas platyrhynchos, Aythya ferina, A. fuligula, Fulica atra, Aythya nyroca, Anas crecca, A. querquedula and A. strepera) are significant for the circulation of cestodes as they harbour 16 cestode species also occurring in Anas platyrhynchos dom.
1272	6299740	Ultrastructure of the purified and reconstituted Na/K-ATPase of the avian salt gland.	Gassner D, Komnick H	Eur J Cell Biol	 1983 Jan;29(2):226-35		Na/K-ATPase of salt-stressed salt glands of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was purified in membrane-bound form by incubation of the microsomal fraction with sodium dodecylsulphate and ATP followed by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. Gel electrophoresis of the purified plasma membrane preparation substantially showed the two polypeptide subunits of the Na/K-ATPase both of which stained with the periodic acid-Schiff reagent. About 99% of the total ATPase activity was ouabain-inhibitable amounting to 1300 mumol Pi/(mg protein X h) of specific activity. The anion-stimulated, ouabain-insensitive ATPase increased parallel to the Na/K-ATPase up to the microsomal fraction until it totally vanished during SDS incubation. Electron microscopy of thin sections revealed that the purified fraction consisted of flat and cup-shaped triple-layered membrane fragments. Particles arranged into clusters and strands were visible as 3 to 5 nm surface particles in negatively stained suspensions and as 8 to 10 nm intramembraneous particles in freeze fracture replicas. The differential distribution of the intramembraneous particles on the fracture faces reflected the structural membrane asymmetry. Solubilization of Na/K-ATPase led to the disappearance of intramembraneous particles. Incorporation of the solubilized enzyme into phosphatidylcholine vesicles again showed 8 to 10 nm particles apparently orientated at random in the artificial membrane. Control liposomes prepared in the absence of solubilized enzyme were devoid of intramembraneous particles. These results clearly demonstrate that the avian salt gland Na/K-ATPase exists as 8 to 10 nm particles in both the purified plasma membrane and the artificial phospholipid membrane.
1273	6187513	Neural mechanisms affecting pressor responses to angiotensins in the Pekin duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Wilson JX, Butler DG	Comp Biochem Physiol A Comp Physiol	 1983;74(2):351-6	 doi: 101016/0300-9629(83)90614-x	1. Administration of SQ20881 diminished pressor responses to intravenous (i.v.) injections of angiotensin I (AI), but not those to injections of angiotensin II (AII), in Pekin ducks, indicating the occurrence of a mechanism similar to the mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme reaction. 2. Pressor responses to AII were enhanced by general anaesthesia with phenobarbital, pentobarbital, or a combination of both phenobarbital and pentobarbital. 3. Ganglionic blockade with mecamylamine enhanced the pressor responses to AII and NE, but not those to tyramine, in anaesthetized ducks. 4. It is proposed that the potentiating effects of general anaesthesia and ganglionic blockade on pressor responses were due both to a lowering of baseline blood pressure (BP) and an inhibition of the neural reflexes which normally buffer BP. Furthermore, it is suggested that the augmented responsiveness of anaesthetized, ganglion-blocked ducks shows that the pressor effect of AII is predominantly of peripheral, rather than central nervous system (CNS), origin.
1274	6132733	The effects of cooling the egg on the respiratory movements of the hatching duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Spear HG, Dawes CM	Comp Biochem Physiol A Comp Physiol	 1983;74(4):861-7	 doi: 101016/0300-9629(83)90359-6	1. The ambient temperature of pipped eggs of the domestic duck was reduced from 39 degrees C to 24 +/- 1.5 degrees C for a period of 1 hr. 2. In the majority of embryos there was a notable increase in the amplitude of respiration. 3. The respiratory frequency of each embryo fell, but remained above a value of 60 breaths/min. 4. When the eggs were rewarmed there was a reduction in the respiratory amplitude within a period of 10 min and the respiratory frequencies of the majority of embryos returned to normal within a period of 30 min. 5. These results are compared with those obtained previously in similar studies on the domestic fowl and quail.
1275	6132724	Effects of aldosterone and corticosterone on cloacal water and electrolyte excretion of constantly-loaded intact and colostomized ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Holmes WN, Wright A, Gorsline J	Comp Biochem Physiol A Comp Physiol	 1983;74(4):795-805	 doi: 101016/0300-9629(83)90349-3	1. Doses of aldosterone (50, 100 and 200 micrograms per kg body wt) evoked similar changes in Na+ and K+ excretion by intact and colostomized ducks loaded with either distilled water or 0.5 isotonic saline (70 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM KCl); both antinatriuretic and antikaliuretic responses were observed. 2. The lowest dose of aldosterone had no effect on electrlyte excretion in intact and colostomized ducks loaded with a solution containing more K+ than Na+ (74 mM KCl, 36 mM NaCl) but the higher doses caused an antinatriuretic response in both groups; a retention of K+ occurred only in intact birds given this solution. 3. The lower dose of corticosterone (1.25 mg per kg body weight) caused both antidiuresis and antinatriuresis in intact birds, but in colostomized birds the decrease in Na+ excretion was not accompanied by an antidiuresis. 4. The higher dose of corticosterone (2.50 mg per kg body wt) caused a significant increase in K+ excretion in colostomized birds, whereas no kaliuresis was ever observed in intact birds. 5. Intact and colostomized birds loaded with 0.5 isotonic saline showed no responses to the lower dose of corticosterone, whereas the higher dose had an antikaliuretic effect in intact birds and an antinatriuretic effect in colostomized birds. 6. Corticosterone had no effect on cloacal water and electrolyte excretion by intact and colostomized birds given loads containing more K+ than Na+.
1276	7163655	Morphometrics of the avian lung. 2. The wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and graylag goose (Anser anser).	Maina JN, King AS	Respir Physiol	 1982 Dec;50(3):299-310	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(82)90025-1	The lungs of 5 wild mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and 5 feral graylag geese (Anser anser) of mean body weight 1.04 and 3.84 kg, respectively, were fixed in situ by intratracheal infusion of 2.3% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4 and total osmolarity 350 mOsm, at a pressure head of 25 cm, and analysed by standard morphometric techniques. The following data apply to both lungs together, in the fixed state, the first value relating to Anas and the second to Anser in each case: lung volume, 30.4 and 95.3 cm3; volume of exchange tissue, 12.32 and 38.50 cm3; volume of capillary blood, 4.06 and 12.49 cm3; surface area of blood-gas (tissue) barrier per unit body weight, 28.56 and 23.10 cm2/g; surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier per unit volume of lung, 977 and 932 cm2/cm3; surface area of blood-gas (tissue) barrier per unit volume of exchange tissue, 241 and 230 mm2/mm3; harmonic mean thickness of tissue barrier, 0.133 and 0.118 microns; arithmetic mean thickness of tissue barrier, 0.903 and 0.887 microns; harmonic mean thickness of plasma layer, 0.369 and 0.322 microns; mean total morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacity per unit body weight, 3.85 and 3.59 ml O2/min/mm Hg/kg. These morphometric parameters of Anas and Anser are compared with those reported in the literature for the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus), the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and the violet-eared hummingbird (Colibri coruscans). The lungs of these six avian species show progressively advancing adaptations, from Gallus, through Anser, Anas, Melopsittacus and Passer, to Colibri, which appear to be consistent with the energetic characteristics of these birds.
1277	7153170	Surface morphology of the ducts of the epididymal region of the drake (Anas platyrhynchos) as revealed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.	Aire TA	J Anat	 1982 Oct;135(Pt 3):513-20		Both scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopic studies of the major ductules and ducts of the perfused epididymal region of the drake were reported. The SEM correlated with TEM studies and confirmed some previous observations that the non-ciliated Types I and II cells in the proximal and distal efferent ductules, respectively, possessed apical microvilli as distinct from the cilia of the ciliated cells. The relative number of each cell type in each duct was also revealed. All microvilli and cilia were regular in shape. The connecting and epididymal ducts showed 'craters' scattered over their entire epithelial surfaces. Also, a single cilium projected from most of the cells of the epithelial lining into the lumen of these ducts. The name, 'uniciliated cell' has been suggested to describe this cell which has, until now, been referred to as the non-ciliated Type III cell (Aire, 1980; Aire et al. 1979). Neither bulbous microvilli nor blebbing of the apical plasmalemma of the cells occurred in properly fixed tissues.
1278	6130168	Enzyme activities in plasma, liver and kidney of black ducks and mallards.	Franson JC	J Wildl Dis	 1982 Oct;18(4):481-5	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-184481	Activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured in plasma, liver, and kidney, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was measured in liver and kidney of black ducks (Anas rubripes). Activities of ALT, AST, GGT, and ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT) were assayed in plasma, liver, and kidney of game-farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Appreciable OCT and AST activity occurred in both liver and kidney. Activities of ALT, CPK, ALP and GGT were higher in kidney, while LDH was higher in liver, GGT was detected in plasma from one of four mallards.
1279	7130459	Exteroceptive and proprioceptive afferents of the trigeminal and facial motor nuclei in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Arends JJ, Dubbeldam JL	J Comp Neurol	 1982 Aug 10;209(3):313-29	 doi: 101002/cne902090309	Central pathways converging upon the trigeminofacial motor nuclei of the mallard were studied in order to elucidate neuroanatomically the presumed influence of primary sensory trigeminal afferents upon jaw muscle activity. The techniques used included the Fink-Heimer I method after lesions, and axonal transport labeling following injections of 3H-leucine or of HRP for retrograde identification of the neurons of origin. A general description is given of the trigeminofacial motor complex. Jaw closer muscles are innervated by trigeminal motor neurons, and facial motor neurons innervate the jaw depressor muscles. Two afferents premotor systems, one including the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MesV) and the other the rhombencephalic reticular formation, are distinguished. The proprioceptive neurons of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus project upon the ipsilateral trigeminal motor nucleus and upon the nucleus supratrigeminalis. The latter cell group bilaterally projects upon the dorsal and intermediate parts of the facial motor nucleus and upon the dorsal and intermediate parts of the facial motor nucleus and upon part of the trigeminal motor nucleus. Exteroceptive information, relayed through the primary sensory trigeminal column (PrV and nTTD), ultimately reaches the motor nuclei via the reticular formation. The reticular formation forms the final link of three separate circuits: a telencephalic one entered through the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus, a cerebellar one via subnucleus oralis of the descending trigeminal system, and a direct one via subnucleus interpolaris. No direct connections between the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus or subnuclei of the descending trigeminal system and the motor nuclei of the trigeminal (NV) and facial (NVII) nerves have been observed, nor are such direct projections present in the outflow of the presumed telencephalic and cerebellar circuits, viz. of the archistriatum and the central cerebellar nuclei, respectively. The archistriatum projects via the occipitomesencephalic tract upon the lateral rhombencephalic reticular formation as far down as the rostral cervical cord, as well as upon the subnucleus interpolaris of the descending trigeminal system. Similarly, efferents from the central cerebellar nuclei reach the reticular formation, which in turn projects bilaterally upon the motor nuclei. Finally, commissural intermotor connections apparently are mediated by reticular cells surrounding the motor nuclei of NV or NVII, rather than emanating from these nuclei directly.
1280	7130060	The rete testis of birds.	Aire TA	J Anat	 1982 Aug;135(Pt 1):97-110		The rete testis in the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), guinea-fowl (Numida meleagris galeata) and drake (Anas platyrhynchos) was studied histologically and with both the scanning and transmission electron microscopes. All the birds have rete epithelial cells varying between squamous and high cuboidal. A cilium-like structure projects from the luminal portion of most cells into the rete lumen, and the outline of the cells varies from polygonal to elongate. Sparse, stubby microvilli were concentrated on the cell borders. Ultrastructural features suggest only moderate secretory and absorptive activities in the cells. The rete testis of birds is amply supplied with blood as well as lymphatic vessels and nerves. Intraepithelial lymphocytes form part of the rete epithelium, and macrophages are present in large numbers in the rete lumen of the domestic fowl and drake and, to a lesser degree, also in the rete epithelium of the drake.
1281	7130045	Innervation of arteriovenous anastomoses in the web of the foot of the domestic duck, Anas platyrhynchos: structural evidence for the presence of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerves.	Molyneux GS, Harmon B	J Anat	 1982 Aug;135(Pt 1):119-28		An analysis of the innervation of arteriovenous anastomoses in the web of the foot of the Pekin Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was compared with the innervation of the right atrium of the duck heart using histochemical, ultrastructural and morphometric techniques, before and after 6OHDA. The presence of intense catecholamine fluorescence and nerve terminals containing typical noradrenergic small dense-cored vesicles, together with the absence of fluorescence and degeneration of noradrenergic terminals after 6OHDA, indicated the presence of a dense adrenergic innervation at the periphery of the anastomoses. Ultrastructural and histochemical data gave support to the presence of a cholinergic innervation. There was evidence that arteriovenous anastomoses were innervated by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves, viz. after 6OHDA, the mean diameter, mean percentage and mean density of granular vesicles in axon profiles associated with anastomoses (107 . 25 nm, 22 . 34% and 12 . 73 vesicles micron-2, respectively) were significantly higher (P less than 0 . 001) than values in the atrium (87 . 13 nm, 9 . 92% and 5 . 51 vesicles micron-2, respectively) and axons associated with anastomoses contained large granular vesicles ranging up to 210 nm in diameter. This non-adrenergic non-cholinergic innervation may represent the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic vasodilatory nerves shown by pharmacological methods to be present in the foot of the Pekin Duck.
1282	6813512	Waterfowl mortality caused by aflatoxicosis in Texas.	Robinson RM, Ray AC, Reagor JC, Holland LA	J Wildl Dis	 1982 Jul;18(3):311-3	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-183311	Waterfowl mortality caused by aflatoxicosis occurred in two separate areas in Texas during the 1977-78 wintering season. The first outbreak occurred in snow geese (Anser caerulescens) on the Gulf Coast prairies, followed by an outbreak in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the north-central portion of the state. Aflatoxin B1 levels in geese were 500 ng/g (dry weight). Aflatoxin B1 levels in the second mortality were 10-250 ng/g (dry weight). The exact source of the toxin was not demonstrated in the first outbreak, but in the second outbreak was traced to waste peanuts, which constituted a major portion of the diet of wintering waterfowl in north-central Texas. Aflatoxin B1 levels in the field peanuts collected in the general areas were 110 ng/g.
1283	7097879	Newcastle disease virus in waterfowl in wisconsin.	Vickers ML, Hanson RP	J Wildl Dis	 1982 Apr;18(2):149-58	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-182149	Newcastle disease virus was isolated from the cloaca of 1-5% of live-trapped waterfowl in Wisconsin in the fall from 1978-1980. Antibody to NDV was detected in 8% of the birds tested, with no apparent difference between sex and age classes. Experimental infection resulted in persistence of virus shedding for months after exposure. Lack of detectable antibody in some of the experimentally infected birds suggests that reported antibody prevalence may not be indicative of the true prevalence of the infection. Isolation of NDV for the last 9 years as well as the detection of antibody in waterfowl over 25 years ago, suggests a well-adapted host-parasite relationship. Experimental evidence of virus persistence in individual mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) provides a mechanism for maintenance of the virus in the wild population.
1284	7070844	Comparative migration, growth and development of Typhlocoelum cucumerinum sisowi in dabbling ducks and Typhlocoelum cucumerinum cucumerinum in diving ducks.	Scott ME, Rau ME, McLaughlin JD	Parasitology	 1982 Apr;84(Pt 2):333-50	 doi: 101017/s0031182000044887	Experimental infections of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos L.) with Typhlocoelum cucumerinum sisowi (Skrjabin, 1913) and of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria (Wilson)) with Typhlocoelum cucumerinum cucumerinum (Rudolphi, 1809) revealed significant differences in various parameters of the life-cycle in the definitive host. Both T. c. sisowi and T. c. cucumerinum migrate to the trachea via the abdominal cavity, air sacs and lungs, although T. c. cucumerinum migrate more quickly and more synchronously than T. c. sisowi. Typhlocoelum c. sisowi has a shorter expected life-span than T. c. cucumerinum but grows and reaches maturity more quickly than T. c. cucumerinum. Evidence suggests that T. c. cucumerinum has a higher fecundity than T. c. sisowi. These differences in the patterns of migration, growth and development are related not only to differences between the two host species but also to differences intrinsic to the parasites, and serve to provide biological support for considering them as separate sub-species.
1285	6122333	Effect of p-p'-DDE administered in vivo and in vitro on Ca2+ binding and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activity in egg shell gland mucose of ducks.	Lundholm CE	Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh)	 1982 Feb;50(2):121-9	 doi: 101111/j1600-07731982tb00953x	Thinning of the egg shell is produced by p-p'-DDT and DDE in several species of birds. A study was made of the effect of DDE administered in vitro and in vivo on the Ca2+ binding and Ca2+-Mg2+-activated ATPase of a homogenate of the egg shell gland of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var.). The concentration of Ca2+ was 1 X 10(-4) M and that of MgATP 1 X 10(-3) M. In vitro, DDE in concentrations of 2-16 micrograms/ml of incubation medium inhibited the Ca2+-Mg2+-activated ATPase in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas Mg2+-activated ATPase was not affected by these concentrations. The Ca2+ binding by the homogenate was reduced by DDE in the same concentrations. The sodium azide sensitive Ca2+ binding was most sensitive. In vivo, DDE administered in a concentration of 40 mg/kg dry weight of the food for 45 days reduced the egg shell index by 18% in comparison to controls. After 45 days of treatment the DDE concentrations in the egg shell gland mucosa was 1.20 +/- 0.16 micrograms/g of wet weight, while no DDE was detected in the controls. The Ca2+-Mg2+-activated ATPase was reduced by 32%, whereas the Mg2+-ATPase was not changed. The Ca2+ binding by the homogenate was reduced by 29%, the sodium azide sensitive part being most vulnerable, DDE increased the total Ca content of the egg shell gland mucosa by 44%. Since Ca is transported against a concentration gradient between blood plasma, and the lumen of the shell gland, it is suggested that DDE, by inhibiting the Ca2+-Mg2+-activated ATPase, decreased the Ca translocation over the egg shell gland mucosa.
1286	7150114	Two low-molecular weight apoproteins (apovitellenins I and II) from a lipoprotein of goose's egg yolk: a comparison with related species.	Inglis AS, Strike PM, Burley RW	Aust J Biol Sci	 1982;35(3):263-9		As part of a comparative study of egg yolk from different avian species, the major lipoprotein and its mixed apoproteins from the egg yolk of the chinese goose (Anser cygnoides) have been prepared. From the apoprotein mixture, two new proteins, of molecular weight approximately 10000 and 22000 according to gel electrophoresis in detergent, have been isolated by gel-filtration chromatography in urea. The protein of lower molecular weight corresponds in amino acid sequence to apovitellenin I, a protein previously isolated from other avian species. As a comparison with other members of the same avian family (Anatidae), the amino acid sequence of apovitellenin I from the pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was re-investigated and that of the muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) investigated. These were found to be identical to the sequence of goose's apovitellenin I. The second new protein is similar in composition, molecular weight, and solubility to apovitellenin II, a protein present in small amount in hen's egg yolk. A protein corresponding to apovitellenin II could not, however, be detected in the egg yolk of either species of duck.
1287	7061266	Effect of cardiovascular variables on hyperpnea during recovery from diving in ducks.	Lillo RS, Jones DR	J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol	 1982 Jan;52(1):206-15	 doi: 101152/jappl1982521206	Control of hyperpnea during recovery from diving in unanesthetized White Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, was examined. Postdive minute ventilation (VE) increased five times regardless of the length of the preceding dive (1-4 min), although longer dives resulted in slower return of VE towards predive levels. Manipulation of arterial blood gases showed that both hypoxia and hypercapnia contributed to hyperpnea on emergence. Although chronic bilateral carotid body denervation depressed VE before and after diving, VE still increased four times after 1-min dives. Postdive hyperpnea was accompanied by dramatic elevations in heart rate, cardiac output, and the ventilation/perfusion ratio. However, artificially maintaining heart rate at abnormally low levels did not affect the postdive hyperpnea. In addition, postdive hyperpnea was unaffected by systemic arterial baroreceptor denervation. Postdive hyperpnea in ducks depends on blood gas changes occurring during a dive, yet a substantial part of the response is independent of input from carotid body chemoreceptors and the accompanying rises in heart rate and cardiac output.
1288	7058921	Control of diving responses by carotid bodies and baroreceptors in ducks.	Lillo RS, Jones DR	Am J Physiol	 1982 Jan;242(1):R105-8	 doi: 101152/ajpregu19822421R105	The precise role of carotid body chemoreceptors and systemic baroreceptors in cardiovascular responses during experimental diving in ducks is controversial. The diving responses of chronically baroreceptor-denervated, chemoreceptor-denervated, and combined baroreceptor- and chemoreceptor-denervated White Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, were compared with those of intact and sham-operated birds. All three types of denervation elevated predive heart rates on average by 100-150 beats/min. During submergence, the cardiac rate of the barodenervates quickly dropped and after 60 s stabilized at levels similar to those of submerged intact ducks for the remainder of a 2-min dive. However, arterial blood pressure declined drastically in the barodenervates. Ducks without functional carotid bodies showed significant bradycardia during submergence, although heart rate only fell to the predive rate of intact animals. Birds with combined baroreceptor and chemoreceptor denervation exhibited the same degree of bradycardia as chemoreceptor denervates, and arterial blood pressure rose spectacularly during a dive. It is concluded that during experimental diving in ducks 1) cardiac responses are not baroreflexive in origin, 2) the major portion of bradycardia is due to stimulation of carotid body chemoreceptors, and 3) intact system baroreceptors appear essential for maintenance of blood pressure.
1289	6764622	Ontogeny and localization of the alpha-, beta-, and delta- crystallin antigens during lens development in mallard embryos.	Brahma SK, van der Starre H	Curr Eye Res	 1982-1983;2(10):663-72	 doi: 103109/02713688209019995	The ontogeny of alpha-, beta-, and delta-crystallin antigens in the developing lens of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence using specific antibodies to mallard alpha-, beta-, and delta- crystallins raised in rabbits. The IgG fraction from each antiserum was isolated by affinity chromatography usign Protein A Sepharose CL-4B. Fluoresceinee (FITC) or rhodamine (TRITC) conjugated goat anti rabbit (GAR) gamma-globulin was used as the secondary antibody. The results show that alpha-, beta-, and delta-crystallins appear simultaneously in the developing mallard lens and are detectable from 66 hr (stage 15/16). This situation is different from the chick where delta- is known to appear first followed by beta-, and alpha-. This could be due to species variation. In the epithelium, however, as in the chick, delta- emerges first followed by beta-, and alpha- but rather late when compared with the chick and this seems probably due to a difference in the incubation time between the two species. Results from immunofluorescence and Tris-SDS gel electrophoresis demonstrate that alpha A subunit of the alpha-crystallin appears much earlier than the alpha B subunit. We also found that the newly discovered epsilon-crystallin (18) appears long after the three major crystallin classes.
1290	6176190	Effects of lindane, paraquat, toxaphene, and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid on mallard embryo development.	Hoffman DJ, Eastin WC Jr	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1982;11(1):79-86	 doi: 101007/BF01055190	The effects were determined of externally treating mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) eggs with two insecticides (lindane and toxaphene) and two herbicides (paraquat and 2,4,5-T) with formulations and concentrations similar to field applications. Paraquat was the most embryotoxic of the four compounds regardless of the type of vehicle. The LC50 for paraquat was 1.5 lb of active ingredient/acre in aqueous emulsion and 0.1 lb/acre in the oil vehicle. The other compounds had LC50's that were several orders of magnitude higher. Both paraquat and toxaphene caused some mortality at 1/2 of the field level of application. Paraquat impaired growth and was slightly teratogenic at 1/2 of the field level of application, but required higher concentrations (1.5 to 3 times the field level) to produce brain and visceral defects. Lindane was teratogenic, resulting in multiple defects but only at doses that were greater than five times the field level of application. Toxaphene resulted in defects of the joints at doses close to or exceeding the LC50. The herbicide 2,4,5-T resulted in few toxic effects and relatively few abnormal survivors with gross defects. The overall embryotoxicity with either vehicle was paraquat greater than lindane greater than toxaphene greater than 2,4,5-T on a lb per acre basis. However the potential hazard at exposures of up to five times the field level of application was paraquat greater than toxaphene; neither lindane nor 2,4,5-T constituted much of a hazard. Both paraquat and lindane were more toxic on lb-per-acre basis when administered in oil vehicle but only paraquat represented a potential hazard at five times the field level of application.
1291	6130869	Patterns of cloacal water and electrolyte excretion in constantly-loaded intact and colostomized ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Holmes WN, Gorsline J, Wright A	Comp Biochem Physiol A Comp Physiol	 1982;73(4):675-7	 doi: 101016/0300-9629(82)90274-2	1. The patterns of cloacal water and electrolyte excretion were qualitatively similar in intact and chronically colostomized ducks given oral loads of either distilled water or electrolyte solution. 2. The rates of Na+ and K+ excretion were each selectively increased in birds loaded with solutions containing a relatively higher concentration of each ion. 3. Compared to the intact birds, the colostomized birds showed lower rates of electrolyte excretion following administration of identical electrolyte loads and thus appeared to be retaining electrolyte. 4. At the same time, a significant antidiuresis of similar magnitude occurred in each group of saline-loaded birds. 5. The possible contributions of renal and post-renal mechanisms to the overall conservation of water in intact and colostomized ducks are discussed.
1292	6817294	Nationwide residues of organochlorine compounds in wings of adult mallards and black ducks, 1979-80.	Cain BW	Pestic Monit J	 1981 Dec;15(3):128-34		Organochlorine residues in wings of adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and black ducks (Anas rubripes) were monitored nationwide from birds harvested during the 1979-80 hunting season. DDE residues were found in all samples. DDT residues had declined from levels reported in 1976 on a flyway basis but the decline was significant (P less than 0.05) only in the Pacific Flyway. Levels of DDT, DDE, TDE, and dieldrin were low on a flyway basis, and all but DDE declined significantly (P less than 0.05) in the percent occurrence. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) levels were lower in mallard wings from all flyways compared with 1976 data, but percent occurrence had significantly (P less than 0.05) increased. Pools from Alabama and New Mexico continued to show higher DDE residues than pools from other areas.
1293	7338949	Recovery of cholinesterase activity in mallard ducklings administered organophosphorus pesticides.	Fleming WJ, Bradbury SP	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1981 Nov-Dec;8(5-6):885-97	 doi: 101080/15287398109530123	Oral doses of the organophosphorus pesticides acephate, dicrotophos, fensulfothion, fonofos, malathion, and parathion were administered to mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos), and brain and plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activities were determined for up to 17 d after dosing. In vivo recovery of brain ChE activity to within 2 standard deviations of the mean activity of undosed birds occurred within 8 d, after being depressed an average of 25-58% at 24 h after dosing. In vivo recovery of plasma ChE appeared as fast as or faster than that of brain, but the pattern of recovery was more erratic and therefore statistical comparison with brain ChE recovery was not attempted. In vitro tests indicated that the potential for dephosphorylation to contribute to in vivo recovery of inhibited brain ChE differed among chemical treatments. Some ducklings died as a result of organophosphate dosing. In an experiment in which ducklings within each treatment group received the same dose (mg/kg), the brain ChE activity in birds that died was less than that in birds that survived. Brain ChE activities in ducklings that died were significantly different among pesticide treatments: fensulfothion greater than parathion greater than acephate greater than malathion (p less than or equal to 0.05).
1294	7325692	Effects of dietary nickel on survival and growth of mallard ducklings.	Cain BW, Pafford EA	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1981 Nov;10(6):737-45	 doi: 101007/BF01054857	Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings were fed nickel sulphate in their diet from day one to 90 days of age. Ducklings fed 1,200 ppm nickel began to tremor and show signs of paresis after 14 days of dosage (age) and 71% of this group died within 60 days of age. Birds fed 1,200 ppm nickel weighed significantly less (P less than 0.05) at 28 days of age than birds fed the other diets. Weights of ducklings fed untreated food or dietary dosages of 200 and 800 ppm nickel diets were not significantly different (P less than 0.05). The weight/length ratio of the humerus (an expression of bone density) from the 800 ppm diet females was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than the control fed females at 30 and 60 days and for all ducklings fed 1,200 ppm at 30 days of age. The organ-weight/body-weight ratios for heart, liver, and gizzard did not differ from controls or between any dosage group. Liver nickel residues from ducklings that died during this study ranged between 1.0 to 22.7 ppm and kidney residues ranged between 2.7 and 74.4 ppm. Liver and kidney tissues from all ducklings that survived to 90 days of age contained less than 1.0 ppm nickel.
1295	7028906	Influence of insulin and glucagon on secretion of growth hormone in growing ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Foltzer C, Harvey S, Strosser MT, Mialhe P	J Endocrinol	 1981 Nov;91(2):189-96	 doi: 101677/joe00910189	An inverse age-related pattern of GH secretion has been identified in immature ducks between 2 and 9 weeks of age, the plasma level of GH falling progressively from 30-40 ng/ml at 2 weeks of age to the adult level (less than 10 ng/ml) by 9 weeks of age. This decrease in GH secretion was not accompanied by any age-related changes in the concentrations of plasma immunoreactive insulin of glucagon-like immunoreactivity or in plasma glucose or free fatty acid level. In 4- to 6-week-old ducklings the intravenous infusion of insulin (2.5 or 10 mu./kg per min for 30 min) and glucagon (0.1 or 0.5 micrograms/kg per min for 30 min) induced some inhibition of GH secretion, independently of changes in blood glucose level. These results suggest that although insulin and especially glucagon have direct effects on GH secretion in the duck, maturational differences in pancreatic function are unlikely to be causally related to the decrease in GH secretion during growth.
1296	6274488	Effects of crude oil ingestion on avian intestinal function.	Eastin WC Jr, Murray HC	Can J Physiol Pharmacol	 1981 Oct;59(10):1063-8	 doi: 101139/y81-162	Intestinal function in mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) on a freshwater regime was studied after a 7-day dietary ingestion of 0.25% and 2.5% Prudhoe Bay crude oil (PBCO) or a 2.5% paraffin mixture with an in vivo luminal perfusion technique. Dietary ingestion of 2.5% PBCO may have an effect on the integrity of the duckling intestine. There were no significant effects of PBCO on the absorption of Na, Cl, K, or H2O compared with control animals. The ducklings fed 2.5% paraffin had a significant depression in Na and H2O absorption compared with controls. However, this depression dose not seem to be related to an effect on intestinal mucosa Na-K-ATPase activity.
1297	6796936	Organochlorine and metal residues in eggs of waterfowl nesting on islands in Lake Michigan off Door County, Wisconsin, 1977-78.	Haseltine SD, Heinz GH, Reichel WL, Moore JF	Pestic Monit J	 1981 Sep;15(2):90-7		One egg from each of 114 red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator) nests in 1977 and 92 nests in 1978 was collected and later analyzed for organochlorines, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), polychlorinated styrenes (PCSs), and metals. One egg was also collected from each of the dabbling duck nests located. Twenty-nine of these eggs were analyzed for organochlorines and metals in 1977; 10 eggs were analyzed in 1978. All merganser eggs contained DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dieldrin; all but one egg collected in 1978 contained DDT. DDE and PCB levels had declined since 1975 to a geometric mean of 7.4 ppm DDE and 20 ppm PCBs in 1977 and 7.6 ppm DDE and 19 ppm PCBs in 1978. Dieldrin residues in eggs had not declined from 1975 levels; the geometric mean was 0.78 ppm in 1977 and 0.76 ppm in 1978. Other organochlorines were present at low levels. Mercury residues averaged greater than 0.50 ppm in merganser eggs and had not declined since 1975. Other metals were present at low levels. Dabbling ducks generally had much lower organochlorine and Hg residues than mergansers; DDE and PCBs were the only organochlorines present in the majority of eggs. Geometric means of PCBs and DDT in dabbling duck eggs did not exceed 2.0 ppm and 1.0 ppm, respectively. PBBs and PCSs were detected only in a few merganser eggs, at low levels. Eggshell thickness for red-breasted merganser eggs averaged 0.359 mm in 1977 and 0.355 mm in 1978, which is only 2%-3% below pre-1946 thicknesses. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) eggshell thicknesses averaged 0.331 mm in 1977 and 0.377 mm in 1978.
1298	6456908	Demonstration and properties of a Cl-/HCO3--ATPase in the avian salt gland (author's transl)	Gassner D, Komnick H	Eur J Cell Biol	 1981 Aug;25(1):108-19		An anion-stimulated, Mg2+-dependent, ouabain-insensitive ATPase is present in salt gland homogenates of domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The enzyme is unspecifically stimulated by various inorganic and organic anions including amino and sulfonic acids which are often used as buffer components (e. g. histidine, Bicin, PIPES, MES and HEPES). Therefore, the demonstration of ATPase stimulation by chloride strongly depends on the type and concentration of the buffer used and may also largely interfere with the stimulation caused by other anions present in the incubation medium. Of the inorganic anions tested chloride and bicarbonate appear to be the favorite physiological activators, but the possible role of carbonic acids in the stimulation of the anion-dependent ATPase should not be neglected. Km values are approximately 5.8 mM for Cl- and approximately 8.7 mM for HCO-3-activation. Maximal ATPase stimulation is obtained at 25 mM Cl- and approximately 30 mM HCO-3, respectively. The simultaneous presence of bicarbonate decreases chloride affinity and Vmax, and shifts the chloride optimum to lower concentrations. ATP is the most preferred substrate. Maximal activation by Cl- and HCO-3 occurs at ATP concentrations between 0.5 and 1 mM. ATP affinity increases in the presence of Cl- and HCO-3, respectively. Both chloride and bicarbonate require a Mg2+ to ATP ratio of approximately 0.5 and a pH value of 8.0 to 8.5 for optimal stimulation. Stimulation by Cl- and HCO-3 is inhibited by thiocyanate, cyanate and by the diuretic drugs furosemide, ethacrynic acid and mersalyl. Incubation media adapted for the simultaneous demonstration of both chloride and bicarbonate activation contained 10 to 20 mM histidine-Tris buffer at pH 8.0 to 8.5, 150 mM sucrose, 0.2 mM ouabain, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM ATP, (pH adjusted to 8.0-8.5 with Tris or NaOH), with and without 25 mM sodium chloride or 25 mM sodium bicarbonate.
1299	7265315	Effects of dietary nickel on mallards.	Eastin WC Jr, O'Shea TJ	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1981 Jun;7(6):883-92	 doi: 101080/15287398109530031	Thirty breeding pairs of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and were fed breeder mash containing 0, 12.5, 50.0, 200.0, or 800.0 ppm Ni (as the sulfate) for 90 d. Ni ingestion had no effect on egg production, hatchability, or survival of ducklings. After 90 d birds were bled, sacrificed, and necropsied. There were no significant differences in hematocrit; concentrations of hemoglobin, plasma triglyceride, and cholesterol; of plasma activities of ornithine carbamoyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase. A black tarry feces was noted in the high Ni dose group at necropsy, but no gross or histopathologic lesions were observed. Although absolute concentrations of Ni in tissues were low, there were significant accumulations in kidneys of birds fed Ni at all dietary levels and in feathers, blood, and livers of birds fed high doses of Ni compared with controls.
1300	7282409	Responses to catecholamines and nerve stimulation of the perfused rete tibiotarsale and associated blood vessels in the hind limb of the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).	Midtgard U, Bech C	Acta Physiol Scand	 1981 May;112(1):77-81	 doi: 101111/j1748-17161981tb06785x	The rete tibiotarsale, which is a functional arterio-venous heat exchanger, and its associated blood vessels were perfused in situ and the responses to epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and perivascular nerve stimulation (NS) were studied. The vasoconstrictor response of the arterial shunt, which bypasses the rete, was significantly greater than in adjacent segments of the same artery. The constrictor responses to E, NE, and NS were reversibly blocked by the alpha-blocker phentolamine. The rete arteries were also capable of vasoconstriction, but during simultaneous perfusion of the arterial shunt and the rete arteries, stimulation with NE and E stopped perfusate flow in the shunt while the flow in the rete arteries increased. Segments of the large vein and rete veins were unresponsive to NE, E, and NS. The results support the previously reported morphological evidences for a sphincteric action of the shunt artery, but not of the shunt vein.
1301	7265309	Effects of chronic ingestion of No. 2 fuel oil on mallard ducklings.	Szaro RC, Hensler G, Heinz GH	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1981 May;7(5):789-99	 doi: 101080/15287398109530020	No. 2 fuel oil was fed to mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings in concentrations of 0.5 and 5.0% of the diet from hatching to 18 wk of age to assess the effects of chronic oil ingestion during early development. Five growth parameters (body weight, wing length, ninth primary length, tarsal length, and bill length) were depressed in birds receiving a diet containing 5% fuel oil. There was no oil-related mortality. The 5% fuel oil diet impaired avoidance behavior of 9-d-old mallard ducklings compared with controls or ducklings fed 0.5% oil. Open-field activity was greatly increased in 16-wk-old ducklings fed 5.0% oil. Liver hypertrophy and splenic atrophy were gross evidences of pathological effects in birds on the 5.0% oil diet. More subtle effects included biochemical lesions that resulted in the elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase and ornithine carbamoyltransferase activity.
1302	7255927	Presence of a complete endothelial barrier between lymph and lymphoid tissue in the lumbar lymph nodes of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Lawn AM, Rose ME	Res Vet Sci	 1981 May;30(3):335-42		The ultrastructure of the lumbar lymph nodes of the domestic duck is described and compared with published accounts of mammalian lymph nodes. The barrier to cell migration between lymphoid tissue and lymph is more formidable in the duck than in the mammal. In the duck the lymphatic endothelium lining the lymph spaces is continuous and bonded with desmosomes whereas in the mammal it is unbonded and fenestrated. In both types of node there are filtering zones and areas of dense lymphatic tissue but their topographical organisation differs. There is no cortex or medulla in the duck lymph node and filtration occurs in extensive lymphatic spaces traversed by numerous trabeculae to which are attached rounded phagocytic macrophages. Dense lymphoid tissue is scattered throughout the node, suspended by trabeculae or attached to the capsule and there are blood vessels analogous to the post capillary venules of mammalian nodes where lymphocytes migrate between blood and lymphoid tissue.
1303	6790722	Embryotoxic effects of benzoa]pyrene, chrysene, and 7,12-dimethylbenza]anthracene in petroleum hydrocarbon mixtures in mallard ducks.	Hoffman DJ, Gay ML	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1981 May;7(5):775-87	 doi: 101080/15287398109530019	Studies with different avian species have revealed that surface applications of microliter amounts of some crude and fuel oils that coat less than 10% of the egg surface result in considerable reduction in hatching with teratogenicity and stunted growth. Other studies have shown that the embryotoxicity is dependent on the aromatic hydrocarbon content, further suggesting that the toxicity is due to causes other than asphyxia. In the present study the effects of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons identified in petroleum were examined on mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) embryo development. Addition of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), chrysene, or 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to a synthetic petroleum hydrocarbon mixture of known composition and relatively low embryotoxicity resulted in embryotoxicity that was enhanced or equal to that of crude oil when 10 microliter was applied externally to eggs at 72 h of development. The order of ability to enhance embryotoxicity was DMBA greater than BaP greater than chrysene. The temporal pattern of embryonic death was similar to that reported after exposure to crude oil, with additional mortality occurring after outgrowth of the chorioallantois. Retarded growth, as reflected by embryonic body weight, crown-rump length, and bill length, was accompanied by teratogenicity. Abnormal embryos exhibited extreme stunting; eye, brain, and bill defects; and incomplete ossification. Gas chromatographic-mass spectral analysis of externally treated eggs showed the passage of aromatic hydrocarbons including chrysene through the shell and shell membranes to the developing embryos. These findings suggest that the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in petroleum, including BaP, chrysene, and DMBA, significantly enhances the overall embryotoxicity in avian species.
1304	7241701	Evaluation of coproexamination as a diagnostic test for avian botulism.	Jensen WI	J Wildl Dis	 1981 Apr;17(2):171-6	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-172171	Fecal extracts and blood sera from 113 ducks showing clinical signs of botulism were examined for Clostridium botulinum type C toxin by means of the mouse toxicity test to evaluate coproexamination as a diagnostic procedure, as compared with demonstration of toxin in serum. When death of test mice unprotected with type specific antitoxin (while protected controls survived) was the criterion, 78.8% of the sera and 5.3% of the fecal extracts were positive. When characteristic signs of intoxication in the unprotected mice was included as evidence of toxin in the specimens, these percentages increased to 86.7 and 6.2, respectively. Fecal specimens were collected hourly for the first 6 h after peroral dosing of eight mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with 1.0 LD50 of type C toxin and at 24, 48, and 72 h from birds surviving that long. From 2 to 4 toxin-positive specimens were passed by all eight ducks during the first 6 h, five specimens were positive at 24 h, and three were positive at 48 h. Only three specimens were collected at 72 h, all of which were negative. These findings suggest that attempts to detect toxin in the feces of wild ducks might have been more successful had the birds been captured earlier in the course of the disease.
1305	7229157	Effects of domestication on production and perception of mallard maternal alarm calls: developmental lag in behavioral arousal.	Miller DB, Gottlieb G	J Comp Physiol Psychol	 1981 Apr;95(2):205-19	 doi: 101037/h0077768	The process of domestication involves intense inbreeding. Field and laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effects of such intense genetic selection on the production and perception of the maternal alarm calls of domestic (Peking) and wild mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). With respect to production, the calls of wild and domestic ducks were comparable in four acoustic features and differed only slightly on two features. With respect to perception, the calls of wild and domestic hens were equally effective in promoting behavioral inhibition in wild and domestic ducklings. Although these data revealed little or no effect of domestication on the structure and function of the maternal alarm call, an unexpected effect was found regarding the domestic ducklings' behavior. Specifically, Pekings showed a greater level of behavioral inhibition than did mallards at 24 hr of age. Further experiments indicated that the differential level of inhibition in the wild and domestic birds reflects a developmental lag in arousal consequent to domestication: 72-hr-old Peking ducklings are behaviorally more aroused than 24-hr-old Peking ducklings and are similar to 24-hr-old mallard ducklings in that respect. This appears to be the first demonstration of behavioral heterochrony, which is believed to be an important mechanism of behavioral evolution.
1306	7217364	Studies on the somatotopy of the trigeminal system in the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos L. IV. Tactile representation in the nucleus basalis.	Berkhoudt H, Dubbeldam JL, Zeilstra S	J Comp Neurol	 1981 Mar 1;196(3):407-20	 doi: 101002/cne901960305	This electrophysiological study complements neuroanatomical work from our department on the somatotopy of the trigeminal system of the mallard. Peripheral areas of mechanoreceptors in bills and tongue were mapped in the telencephalic nucleus basalis, a second-order relay nucleus in the ascending trigeminal pathway. The multi-unit responses recorded under Equithesin anaesthesia did not show spontaneous activity and all animals adapted rapidly after mechanical stimulation. They showed well-circumscribed receptive fields whose peripheral position did not change when the electrode was lowered in the vertical stereotaxic plane, but changes immediately when its position was changed in the horizontal XZ-plane. The somatotopic picture presented here corresponds in many details to that obtained with combined neuroanatomical techniques (Dubbeldam et al., '81). In the discussion the structural point-to-point relationship between the peripheral mechanoreceptive areas and the nucleus basalis is tentatively changed to a division into areas related to the functional units involved in the subsequent sensory events during feeding. The somatotopy provides a basis for future chronic experiments to investigate this postulated role of the various areas in the nucleus basalis.

Dubbeldam JL, Brauch CS, Don A	J Comp Neurol	 1981 Mar 1;196(3):391-405	 doi: 101002/cne901960304	The ascending projections from the principal sensory nucleus V (PrV) have been studied by tracing degeneration after lesions in the PrV and by injections of HRP into the projection zone of PrV. The quintofrontal tract arises from PrV, ascends into the forebrain, and terminates in the ipsilateral and the contralateral nucleus basalis (NB). The contralateral fibers decussate in the tegmentum at the level of the trochlear-oculomotor nuclei. NB is a laminar nucleus lying over the rostral part of the paleostriatal complex. Dorsally NB is bounded by the neostriatum. NB consists of small neurons. In the dorsal part of NB, these neurons are arranged in vertical columns; the afferents ascend through these columns, and clusters of degenerated boutons are found around the cells. It is possible to distinguish regions in NB receiving ophthalmic, maxillary, mandibular, or glossopharyngeal afferents. The rostral part of NB receives an exclusive ipsilateral projection; the intermediate part, a bilateral projection; and the caudal part, a contralateral projection, with the exception of the most caudal area, which also receives a bilateral projection. It is not clear whether NB should be considered a thalamic, a telencephalic, or even a pallial structure. The hypothesis that the columnar organization of the NB is a prerequisite to preserve a precise somatotopy of the tactile system of the oral region is discussed. In this respect the organization of NB can be compared to that of layer IV of the somatosensory (SI) cortex of mammals. Knowledge of the structure and functions of the peripheral tactile sense system opens the possibility of subdividing the NB into functional units.
1308	6111401	Inhibition of a Cl-/HCO3(-)ATPase in the avian salt gland by furosemide and ethacrynic acid.	Gassner D, Komnick H	Cell Biol Int Rep	 1981 Mar;5(3):239-46	 doi: 101016/0309-1651(81)90222-8	An ouabain-insensitive, Mg2+-dependent, chloride- and bicarbonate-stimulated ATPase is present in salt gland homogenates of domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Furosemide and ethacrynic acid are non-competitive inhibitors of this enzyme in vitro. The inhibitor constant of furosemide is Ki = 2.5 mM and of ethacrynic acid Ki = 1.9 mM. In contrast, under the same conditions the salt gland Na+/K+-ATPase activity is not inhibited by furosemide, whereas ethacrynic acid becomes inhibitory only at higher concentrations (10 mM).
1309	7271655	Naturally occurring and experimentally induced castor bean (Ricinus communis) poisoning in ducks.	Jensen WI, Allen JP	Avian Dis	 1981 Jan-Mar;25(1):184-94		Castor bean (Ricinus communis) poisoning accounted for the death of several thousand ducks in the Texas panhandle in the fall and winter months of 1969-1971. Signs of intoxication resembled those of botulism, except for mucoid, blood-tinged excreta. The most common lesions were severe fatty change in the liver, widely distributed internal petechial hemorrhages or ecchymoses, and catarrhal enteritis. Nearly intact castor beans were found in the stomach of one duck during field necropsy. Fragments of seed coat resembling castor bean were found in the stomachs of 10 of 14 ducks examined in the laboratory. Clinical signs and postmortem lesions observed in wild ducks were induced experimentally in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) by force-feeding intact castor beans. Toxicity titrations were erratic, but the LD50 appeared to be between three and four seeds. The mouse toxicity test, used to detect Clostridium botulinum toxin in the blood serum of intoxicated ducks, was negative in every case. Hemagglutination and precipitin tests generally failed to detect castor bean in extracts of excreta or intestinal contents of experimentally intoxicated ducks.
1310	7224673	Recovery of brain and plasma cholinesterase activities in ducklings exposed to organophosphorus pesticides.	Fleming WJ	Arch Environ Contam Toxicol	 1981;10(2):215-29	 doi: 101007/BF01055623	Brain and plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activities were determined for mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) exposed to dicrotophos and fenthion. Recovery rates of brain ChE did not differ between ducklings administered a single oral dose vs. a 2-week dietary dose of these organophosphates. Exposure to the organophosphates, followed by recovery of brain ChE, did not significantly affect the degree of brain ChE inhibition or the recovery of ChE activity at a subsequent exposure. Recovery of brain ChE activity followed the general model Y = a + b(logX) with rapid recovery to about 50% of normal, followed by a slower rate of recovery until normal ChE activity levels were attained. Fenthion and dicrotophos-inhibited brain ChE were only slightly reactivated in vitro by pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide, which suggested that spontaneous reactivation was not a primary method of recovery of ChE activity. Recovery of brain ChE activity can be modeled for interpretation of sublethal inhibition of brain ChE activities in wild birds following environmental applications of organophosphates. Plasma ChE activity is inferior to brain ChE activity for environmental monitoring, because of its rapid recovery and large degree of variation among individuals.
1311	6296945	Participation of glucocorticoids in the regulation of plasma LH levels in the male domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Deviche P, Hendrick JC	Reprod Nutr Dev	 1981;21(6B):1137-42	 doi: 101051/rnd:19810812	Adult male domestic ducks were treated in autumn for 14 consecutive days with either (i) long-acting ACTH (20 IU/day), (ii) corticosterone (25 mg/day), (iii) dexamethasone (0.25 mg/day) or (iv) a control solution. Blood samples were obtained from all birds after 1, 3, 7 and 14 injections of hormones; on each of these occasions, a sample was obtained 3 times during the day. The 3 hormonal treatments induced a marked and transient (observed on the 3rd and 7th, but not on the 1st and 14th days of injection) elevation of the LH plasma levels. This increase was not associated with any alteration of the testosterone plasma levels. The results are discussed in view of our knowledge of the influence of adrenal hormones on the pituitary-gonadal axis.

Lundholm CE	Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh)	 1980 Nov;47(5):377-84	 doi: 101111/j1600-07731980tb01576x	One of the main ecotoxicological effects of DDT and its stable metabolite DDE is to reduce the reproductive success in several species of birds by decreasing the thickness of the eggshell. In two different strains of ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var.) addition of 40 mg/kg dry weight of p-p'-DDE to the diet for 45 days produced a significant and long-lasting reduction of the shell thickness, measured as eggshell index. The reduction was more marked in Indian Runner Ducks (IRD; 30 +/- 3%) than in a Swedish X Rouen breed (SR; 10 +/- 2%. The p-p'-DDE residues in the egg yolk + egg white were almost similar in the two strains; 38 +/- 2 and 51 +/- 6 p.p.m. (wet weight) respectively. In the IRD 40 mg/kg of o-p'-DDE in the diet for 45 days was much less potent in reducing the eggshell index (8 +/- 3%) than the p-p' isomer; the amount of residue of the o-p' isomer in the eggs (2.2 +/- 0.1 p.p.m.) was also smaller. A homogenate of the shell gland from the SR breed accumulated 45Ca2+ in the presence of ATP. The accumulation was inhibited about 50% by 5 mM sodium azide and 100% by 3 mM mersalyl. p-p'- and o-p'-DDE in the incubation medium both reduced the Ca2+ binding, in a similar and dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentration was about 20 p.p.m.; 40 p.p.m. reduced the accumulation by about 40%. DDE may reduce eggshell thickness by inhibiting the Ca binding to the membranes of the cells of the eggshell gland.
1313	7217841	Reproductive capacities of control mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) during a one-generation reproduction study.	Piccirillo VJ, Quesenberry RP	J Environ Pathol Toxicol	 1980 Nov;4(5-6):133-9		The Mallard duck (Anas Platyrhynchos) is the waterfowl model of choice for testing the reproductive impairment of pesticides and environmental contaminants. The literature contains numerous reports on the effects of pesticides on egg shell development for mallards, quail and other avian species. Limited control data for reproductive evaluation of pesticides can be found. This paper summarizes one generation reproduction results from 75 control female mallard ducks. One male and five female adult ducks were housed in clean pens with tap water and game bird breeder ration available ad libitum. The pre-egg laying cycle was ten weeks in duration. For the first eight weeks, the photoperiod was seven hours light per day, after which the photoperiod was increased to 17 hours to induce egg laying. Eggs were collected daly for eight weeks and incubated. Shell thickness was measured on one egg from each pen bi-weekly. The mean reproductive indices are as follows: Eggs Cracked/Eggs Laid - 2.18%; Viable 11-Day Embryos/Eggs Set-85.2%; Live 21-Day Embryos/Viable 11-Day Survivors-97.6%; Hatchlings/Live 21-Day Embryos-80.6%; and 14-Day Survivors/Hatchlings-89.3%. The mean egg shell thickness for 60 eggs is 0.378 millimeters.
1314	6780700	Hematozoa of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) of the Pacific Flyway, Washington.	Clark GW	J Wildl Dis	 1980 Oct;16(4):529-31	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-164529	Blood smears from 837 mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), collected during January and February from various locales in Washington during the period 1974-1977, were examined for hematozoa. Of these, 339 (40.5%) harbored blood parasites: Leucocytozoon simondi was the most common, occurring in 24.4% of the birds, followed by Haemoproteus nettionis (23.4%). Microfilariae were found in 14 birds (1.7%).
1315	6253590	Influence of stress on the secretion of corticosterone in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Harvey S, Merry BJ, Phillips JG	J Endocrinol	 1980 Oct;87(1):161-71	 doi: 101677/joe00870161	The influence of stress on the secretion of corticosterone has been investigated by radioimmunoassay in domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) of 6-8 weeks of age. Intravenous and i.m. injections of synthetic ACTH (Synacthen, 25 i.u./bird and Synacthen Depot, 100 i.u./bird respectively) markedly increased (2.7- to 10-fold) basal concentrations of corticosterone in plasma (3-6 ng/ml) in comparison with those in birds injected with 0.9% saline (1 ml/bird). Maximum levels of 30-40 ng/ml plasma were reached after 30 min and 5 h respectivley. Increased levels of corticosterone in plasma were also seen within 5 min of i.v. administration of saline and remained as high as those in birds treated with Synacthen for at least 20 min after injection. Blood sampling (from the brachial vein) was, by itself, sufficient to increase levels of corticosterone in plasma; a large (twofold) rise being observed as soon as 1 min after initial handling and bleeding, with concentrations of 30-40 ng/ml being found in birds bled 15 times during a period of 14 min. However, in a flock of birds, the alarm created in unhandled birds while others were being bled had no effect on concentrations of corticosterone in plasma. Deprivation of food or water for 24 h also enhanced levels of corticosterone in plasma, as did 24 h of adaptation to 0.2 M-NaCl drinking water. These results have demonstrated the lability of the secretion of corticosterone in response to stress and demonstrated its usefulness as a physiological indicator of stress in ducks.
1316	7430896	Incubation in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos): changes in plasma levels of prolactin and luteinizing hormone.	Goldsmith AR, Williams DM	J Endocrinol	 1980 Aug;86(2):371-9	 doi: 101677/joe00860371	The concentrations of prolactin and LH were measured in the plasma of male and female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during the breeding season. The concentration of prolactin in the female birds was low before and during egg-laying, increased threefold (P less than 0.001) during incubation and returned to basal levels immediately after the young were hatched. The drakes, which do not participate in incubation in this species, had fairly low prolactin levels throughout the breeding period; levels being slightly higher during the incubation phase than at other times but still much lower (P less than 0.001) than in the incubating females. Concentrations of LH in the females were high during egg-laying but declined at the onset of incubation. In the drakes levels of LH remained high for much longer and did not appear to decline at a fixed time relative to the reproductive cycle of the female birds. These observations support the view that prolactin is associated with incubation in birds, though the data do not permit a conclusion as to whether an increase in prolactin secretion causes incubation behaviour or is stimulated by it.
1317	7232144	Occurrence of influenza A viruses and their antibodies in migratory birds in Finland.	Estola T, Saikku P, Pirkola M, Hakkinen I, Veijalainen P, Ek-Kommonen C	Nord Vet Med	 1980 Jul-Aug;32(7-8):321-4		A Finnish material of 455 cloacal specimens from 24 species of small migratory birds and of 54 cloacal specimens from 10 species of waterfowl was investigated for the occurrence of A type influenza virus. Influenza A virus was isolated in only one specimen, originating from a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Parallely, yolk material from 109 waterfowl representing 9 species was investigated for the occurrence of influenza A antibodies by complement fixation and immunodiffusion tests. In three yolk specimens, one from a widgeon (Anas penelope), one from a common gull (Larus canus) and one from a lesser blackbacked gull (Larus fuscus), positive reactions with low titres of 1:2--1:4 were obtained. The study shows that waterfowl can carry influenza A virus, but the role of small migratory birds in this respect seems to be negligible in Finland.
1318	6999036	Studies on the somatotopy of the trigeminal system in the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos L. II. Morphology of the principal sensory nucleus.	Dubbeldam JL	J Comp Neurol	 1980 Jun 15;191(4):557-71	 doi: 101002/cne901910404	The projections from the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular parts of the trigeminal ganglion upon the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus (PrV) in the mallard have been studied with the Fink-Heimer I method. PrV is a large nucleus subdivided in cell groups by layers of fibers. The orientation of the dentritic arborizations differs in the different parts of the nucleus. A dorso-caudal cell group sIX is an exclusive glossopharyngeal terminal field. A second, caudo-ventral projections area of NIX also receives trigeminal afferents. A small n. supratrigeminalis lies medial to PrV in the pathway of the mesencephalic trigeminal root. This nucleus seems to be part of the proprioceptive trigeminal system. The rostralmost part of PrV receives ophthalmic projections, the caudalmost part receives mandibular projections, the maxillary area being intermediate. Taking the stereotaxic plane of the mallard atlas (Zweers, '71) into account, it can be concluded that the situation is essentially not different from that in the pigeon and from the situation described for mammals.
1319	7439771	Analysis of growth in a complex muscle (M. supracoracoideus, Anas platyrhynchos).	Swatland HJ	Growth	 1980 Jun;44(2):139-46		Volumetric growth of supracoracoideus muscles in domestic ducks from hatching to 10 weeks was divided into components due to longitudinal and radial (cross sectional area) growth. Although deceleration occurred in week 7, growth increments from both dimensions were still found in week 10. At the cellular level, deceleration of muscle fiber radial growth was later (week 9) than longitudinal fiber growth (week 7). By week 10, longitudinal fiber growth had ceased. Analysis of muscle geometry suggested that radial muscle fiber growth contributed to both whole muscle length and cross sectional area.
1320	6999114	Prolonged survival of skin allografts in mallards.	Mueller NS	J Exp Zool	 1980 Jun;212(3):455-9	 doi: 101002/jez1402120317	Skin allografts were exchanged between 25 males and 25 female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) within 2 days after hatching. Of the 42 ducks that survived and whose grafts healed, 14% rejected rapidly before the grafts became feathered, 20% rejected between 3-6 weeks, and one duck rejected when he was 10 weeks old. Twenty-seven of the 42 ducks (64%) retained their grafts for at least 5 months. The results demonstrate that, in mallards, neither inbreeding nor any treatment of the host is necessary for prolonged survival of skin allografts made shortly after hatching.
1321	6246810	Dissociation of avian salt gland: separation procedures and characterization of dissociated cells.	Hootman SR, Ernst SA	Am J Physiol	 1980 May;238(5):C184-95	 doi: 101152/ajpcell19802385C184	A procedure for dissociation of the nasal salt glands of the domestic duck, Anas platyrhynchos, into suspensions of individual cells has been developed. This technique employs enzymatic digestion with collagenase, hyaluronidase, and chymotrypsin; divalent cation chelation with EDTA; and gentle mechanical dispersion. Average cellular yields of 39 and 26% based on DNA recovered were obtained from the glands of freshwater- and saline-adapted ducks, respectively. Epithelial secretory cells comprised 60-80% of the cell suspensions with the remainder of the populations consisting of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and blood cells. The dissociated cells were viable as judged by trypan blue exclusion (80-100%, maintenance of ultrastructural integrity, and retention of responsiveness to secretagogues and metabolic inhibitors. Methacholine chloride (0.5 mM) stimulated oxygen consumption by suspensions of both freshwater- and saline-adapted cells, whereas ouabain (0.05 mM) abolished the methacholine-stimulated respiratory response. These cell suspensions provide a promising system for the in vitro study of secretory mechanisms in the avian salt gland.
1322	7412022	The susceptibility of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) to Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin.	Jensen WI, Duncan RM	Jpn J Med Sci Biol	 1980 Apr;33(2):81-6	 doi: 107883/yoken19523381	Most strains of Clostridium botulinum type C, after having lost their capacity to produce their dominant toxin (C1) as a result of being "cured" of their prophages, continue to produce C2, a trypsin-activable toxin reported by other investigators. While of relatively low toxicity when administered perorally to the adult mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), it was highly toxic when given parenterally. By the intravenous route, for example, it was more than 1,000 times as toxic as C1 toxin by the same route, when compared on the basis of mouse intraperitoneal toxicity. The cause of death in every instance was massive pulmonary edema and hemorrhage rather than the respiratory paralysis that occurs in C1 intoxication.
1323	7375742	Oxygen transport during progressive hypoxia in high-altitude and sea-level waterfowl.	Black CP, Tenney SM	Respir Physiol	 1980 Feb;39(2):217-39	 doi: 101016/0034-5687(80)90046-8	Under conditions of progressive hypoxia, oxygen transport was compared in bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), a species which breeds on the Tibetan Plateau and migrates at altitudes up to 9200 m, and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos, forma domestica), a similarly sized, sea-level water fowl that does not fly. Pekin ducks showed no altitude-induced behavioral effects (e.g., restlessness) up to 7620 m, while bar-headed geese tolerated 10,668 m with no observable behavioral changes. Ventilatory and cardiac responses to hypoxia as functions of PaO2 followed a typical hyperbolic contour, but the response began at almost 20 Torr lower in the bar-headed goose. Both ventilation and cardiac output appeared to follow a common response curve for the two species, when the independent variable was expressed as arterial oxygen content. The goose had a high oxygen affinity hemoglobin, compared with the duck; the oxyhemoglobin curves of both shifted slightly to the right as a result of acclimation to 5640 m; but only the duck developed erythrocytosis as a consequence of acclimation. Under sea level conditions the duck maintained a higher mixed venous PO2, but with acute hypoxic exposures PVO2 was higher in the goose. Following acclimation, cardiac output in the duck was lower than in pre-acclimatized state, but in the goose it was higher up to the altitude at which it migrates. The selective pressures leading to the evolution of favorable oxygen transport in the bar-headed goose are discussed.
1324	7357208	A comparison in vitro of the vasoconstrictor responses of the mesenteric arterial vasculature from the chicken and the duckling to nervous stimulation and to noradrenaline.	Gooden BA	Br J Pharmacol	 1980 Feb;68(2):263-73	 doi: 101111/j1476-53811980tb10415x	1 The vasoconstrictor responses of isolated mesenteric arterial vasculature of 2 to 5 week old domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus) and domestic ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) to periarterial nerve stimulation and to intra- and extra-vascular noradrenaline were compared.2 The tissues were perfused at a constant flow rate (2 ml/min) and the change in perfusion pressure produced by the various stimuli was used as a measure of the vasoconstrictor response. In a further study a constant pressure (50 mmHg)-variable flow system was used to corroborate the findings with the constant flow system.3 The mean pressure response produced by nervous stimulation in the duckling mesentery (137 +/- 62 mmHg) was approximately 3 times greater than that produced in the chicken mesentery (46 +/- 29 mmHg; P < 0.001). Cocaine hydrochloride (1 x 10(-5) M) potentiated the responses in the duckling but not in the chicken.4 The mean maximum pressure response evoked by intravascular noradrenaline in the duckling (170 +/- 27 mmHg) was significantly greater than that in the chicken (92 +/- 32 mmHg; P < 0.001). Cocaine produced a similar degree of potentiation in the 2 species.5 The mean maximum pressure response evoked by extravascular noradrenaline in the chicken (70 +/- 23 mmHg) was significantly greater than that in the duckling (36 +/- 25 mmHg; P < 0.001) which was the converse of the effect for intravascular noradrenaline. Cocaine produced a much greater potentiation of the responses to extravascular noradrenaline in the duckling than in the chicken.6 The results from the constant pressure study were similar to the corresponding findings in the constant flow studies. Nervous stimulation arrested flow in the duckling mesentery but not in the chicken. The maximum reduction in flow rate produced by intravascular noradrenaline was significantly greater in the duckling than in the chicken (P < 0.001).7 Quantitative histological studies were performed on transverse sections of arteries prepared with haematoxylin and eosin staining and histochemical fluorescence from 4 chickens and 4 ducklings. The mean wall thickness:lumen diameter ratios of the primary and secondary branches of the duckling mesenteric arterial vasculature were 1.8 and 4.3 times greater than those of the chicken respectively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). The mean density of noradrenergic innervation of the main artery and its primary branches in the duckling was 1.7 and 2.4 times greater than that of the chicken respectively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01).8 The functional differences demonstrated in this study can be explained, at least partially, on the basis of the structural differences observed. During diving in the duck, intense peripheral vasoconstriction is believed to conserve the limited oxygen stores for those tissues most sensitive to oxygen lack. The structural and functional findings in the present study reveal that the duckling mesenteric arterial vasculature is well adapted to produce powerful vasoconstriction and hence play its role in oxygen conservation during diving.

Gay ML, Belisle AA, Patton JF	J Chromatogr	 1980 Jan 4;187(1):153-60	 doi: 101016/s0021-9673(00)87881-4	Methods were developed for the analysis of 16 hydrocarbons in avian tissue. Mechanical extraction with pentane was followed by clean-up on Florisil and Silicar. Residues were determined by gas-liquid chromatography and gas-liquid, chromatography-mass spectrometry. The method was applied to the analysis of liver, kidney, fat, and brain tissue of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) fed a mixture of hydrocarbons. Measurable concentrations of all compounds analyzed were present in all tissues except brain. Highest concentrations were in fat.
1326	30157609	Annular bands of lymphoid tissue in the intestine of the mallard duck Anas platyrhynchos.	McGarry RC, Bourns TKR	J Morphol	 1980 Jan;163(1):1-8	 doi: 101002/jmor1051630102	The annular bands were studied by light and scanning electron microscopy in normal and hormonally bursectomized ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The four annular bands are normal lymphoid structures of 5-10 mm wide and encircle the intestine at regularly spaced position, two on each side of Meckel's diverticulum. The anterior three are well defined, complete rings whereas the posterior-most encompasses about one half of the gut circumference. The bands are characterized by prominent follicles in the tunica muscularis, submucosa, and lamina propria. In addition, large numbers of diffusely organized lymphocytes fill the lamina propria and villus cores. Each nodule possesses germinal centre activity, as revealed by the characteristic macrophage content seen in 1.0 mum sections. The bands were present in rudimentary form at hatching. Lymphoid nodules began to develop at day 3 and were morphologically mature at day 98 posthatching. When viewed in the scanning electron microscope, the mucosa of the lymphoid areas was seen to be arranged in tortuous folds, often with irregular fusions. Following hormonal bursectomy, the bands were present, although difficult to detect, and lacked distinct nodules and germinal centres. The mucosal surface still appeared irregularly folded in the SEM, but the folds were more slender with convoluted surfaces.

Scott ME, Rau ME, McLaughlin JD	J Wildl Dis	 1980 Jan;16(1):71-5	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-16171	The upper respiratory tracts of 534 wild anatids representing 20 species, shot during the 1976, 1977 and 1978 hunting seasons, were examined for Typhlocoelum cucumerinum (Rudolphi, 1809). Typhlocoelum cucumerinum cymbium (Diesing, 1850) were recovered from Anas platyrhynchos, Anas rubripes, Anas acuta, Anas discors and Anas crecca. The maximum prevalence (16.7%) and intensity of infection (1.6) occurred in mallards (A. platyrhynchos). Aythya valisineria and Aythya marila harboured Typhlocoelum cucumerinum cucumerinum (Rudolphi, 1809). The maximum prevalence (14.3%) and intensity of infection (8.0) occurred in canvasbacks (A. valisineria). Of the 13 other species of ducks examined, none were infected with T. cucumerinum.
1328	7373725	Helminth fauna of waterfowl in central Oklahoma.	Shaw MG, Kocan AA	J Wildl Dis	 1980 Jan;16(1):59-64	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-16159	Free-ranging waterfowl wintering in and migrating through central Oklahoma were collected and examined for intestinal helminths. Seventy-one ducks, including mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), American widgeons (Anas americana), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and green-winged teal (Anas crecca) were examined; 64 (90.1%) harbored one or more species of metazoa. Six cestodes, 6 trematodes, 6 nematodes, and 1 acanthocephalan were identified, An experimental, non-flying population of ducks was established and monitored to determine the extent of helminth transmission in central Oklahoma. Seven species of helminths were acquired by the sentinel birds during the study. The significance of the parasites recovered and variations in prevalence and species composition of the infections are discussed as they relate to the life cycles of the parasites and the ecology of the hosts.
1329	6772736	Changes in pituitary responsiveness to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone during an annual cycle in the domestic duck, Anas platyrhynchos L.	Balthazart J, Willems J, Hendrick JC	J Exp Zool	 1980 Jan;211(1):113-23	 doi: 101002/jez1402110113	On four occasions during an annual cycle, 5--7 male domestic ducks were injected with two different doses (5 and 20 micrograms) of synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) to study the possible changes in responsiveness of the pituitary. The luteinizing hormone (LH) and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured in the plasma samples collected after these injections. The induced release of LH changes from one period of the year to another, being minimum in March at the height of the reproductive season. The LHRH injection also induces the release of some FSH but only in limited amounts. The changes in pituitary responsiveness to LHRH are negatively correlated to changes in the circulating LH level (it is high when the plasma LH is low and vice versa). This suggests that the hypothalamic synthesis and release of LHRH must also change during the year.

Julian RJ, Galt DE	J Wildl Dis	 1980 Jan;16(1):39-44	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-16139	Haemoproteus infection was confirmed in white Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) following placement in a pond where severe mortality from a respiratory condition apparently caused by schizonts of Haemoproteus had occurred in muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata). Blood from one infected white Pekin duck was experimentally inoculated into five muscovy ducks; two of the five developed large numbers of schizonts in the endothelial cells and died. Illness did not occur in the white Pekin ducks.
1331	6243921	Occurrence of Hsw 1 N 1 subtype influenza A viruses in wild ducks in Europe.	Ottis K, Bachmann PA	Arch Virol	 1980;63(3-4):185-90	 doi: 101007/BF01315025	Two identical strains of influenza A viruses antigenically related to swine influenza (Hsw 1 N 1) have been isolated from adult mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in Southern Germany. They were designated A/Duck/Bavaria/1/77 and A/Duck/Bavaria/2/77. Serologic tests revealed a close antigenic relationship to the strain A/Duck/Alberta/35/76. Experimental infections of piglets with strain A/Duck/Bavaria/1/77 demonstrated the susceptibility of swine to this virus strain. The virus was isolated from nasal swabs of infected piglets up to 8 days p. inf. and from contact animals up to 9 days. No seroconversion was detected during an observation period of 30 days.
1332	542897	Teratogenic effects of external egg applications of methyl mercury in the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos.	Hoffman DJ, Moore JM	Teratology	 1979 Dec;20(3):453-61	 doi: 101002/tera1420200315	The embryotoxic potential of external applications of methyl mercury on mallard eggs was investigated to assess the possible impact of mercury transferred from the plumage of effluent-contaminated aquatic birds to their eggs. Eggs were treated on day 3 of development with microliter applications of methyl mercury that was dissolved with ethyl acetate into an aliphatic hydrocarbon vehicle. Mercury analysis by atomic absorption indicated that almost half of the mercury applied entered the eggs past the shell membranes within several days of treatment. Most mortality occurred within this period at doses of 9 microgram of mercury per egg or higher. Decreased embryonic growth resulted with similar doses. A significant incidence of malformations occurred at a dose of 1 microgram per egg. These malformations were mainly minor skeletal aberrations and incomplete ossification. With higher doses of mercury, defects included gross external ones such as micromella, gastroschisis, and eye and brain defects. Application of the aliphatic hydrocarbon vehicle did not result in any of these defects.

Riemann HP, Behymer DE, Franti CE, Crabb C, Schwab RG	J Wildl Dis	 1979 Oct;15(4):515-23	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-154515	Serum samples from 15 species of rodents and 33 species of birds were tested for agglutinins against Coxiella burnetii by the microagglutination test. Of 759 rodents tested, 21 (3%) were seropositive. Antibody positive rodents included muskrats, Ondatra zebethica, (11%), Rattus spp. (10%), Beechey ground squirrels, Otospermophilus beecheyi, (6%), wood rats, Neotoma fuscipes, (5%), and Peromyscus spp. (2%). Of 583 birds tested, 118 (20%) were seropositive. This included white crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys, gold crowned sparrows, Z. atricapilla, and English sparrows, Passer domesticus, (68% in the composite); coots, Fulica americana, (29%); blackbirds, Euphagus cyanocephalus, (33%); crows, Corvus brachyrhyncos, (29%); robins, Turdus migratorius, (16%); pigeons, Columba fasciata, (10%); and mallard ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, (7%). There was a tendency for the seropositive animals to have been collected in the vicinity of endemically infected livestock.
1334	93890	Effects of exogenous gonadotropic and steroid hormones on the social behaviour and gonadal maturation of male domestic ducklings Anas platyrhynchos L.	Balthazart J, Hendrick JC	Arch Int Physiol Biochim	 1979 Oct;87(4):741-61	 doi: 103109/13813457909070533	Male domestic ducklings were injected during their first month of life with mammalian gonadotrophins (ovine LH or FSH, HMG) or gonadal steroids (testosterone or oestradiol). LH and testosterone stimulated sexual behaviour while oestradiol inhibited the increase of aggression observed in control birds during the experiment. The mammalian gonadotrophins did not increase plasma testosterone but nevertheless they all stimulated the testis growth. Several hypotheses which could explain this finding (stimulation of spermatogenesis without any apparent effect on testosterone) are discussed and the possibility of a direct action of LH on the sexual behaviour is analysed. Social displays were only moderately stimulated by testosterone and not at all by gonadotrophins. The hormonal controls of these behaviour patterns remains thus largely unknown.

Klingbeil CK, Holmes WN, Pearce RB, Cronshaw J	Cell Tissue Res	 1979 Sep 2;201(1):23-36	 doi: 101007/BF00238044	Slices of whole adrenal gland tissue, incubated in vitro in the presence of ACTH for 1 h and 2 h produced corticosterone and aldosterone in constant ratio (16:1). Tangential slices taken from the region immediately below the connective tissue capsule and slices taken from deeper regions of the gland consisted primarily of cells conforming to the distinct structural characteristics of the subcapsular zone (SCZ) and inner zone (IZ) tissues respectively. When samples were incubated in the presence of ACTH for 1 h and 2 h, the interrenal cells of the SCZ produced relatively more aldosterone than cells taken from the IZ of the gland. The corticosterone: aldosterone ratio for the IZ after 1 h (68:1) and after 2 h (102:1) were ten times greater than the ratios for the SCZ after 1 h (7:1) and after 2 h (10:1). The SCZ slices were not more than 60 cells thick and consisted of cells arranged in cords. These cells contained irregular nuclei, mitochondria with shelf-like cristae and a moderate abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, the production of large amounts of corticosterone by the cells of the IZ was associated with tissue containing more vascular space than the SCZ and the cells contained large round nuclei surrounded by an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria had tubular rather than shelf-like cristae.

Hoffman DJ	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1979 Sep;5(5):835-44	 doi: 101080/15287397909529793	Egg surface applications of microliter quantities of crude and refined oils of high aromatic content are embryotoxic to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and other avian species; applications of aliphatic hydrocarbons have virtually no effect. Mallard eggs at 72 h of development were exposed to a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons or to aromatic compounds representative to those present in crude oil to assess their toxicity. The class composition of the mixture was similar to that of South Louisiana crude oil, an American Petroleum Institute reference oil. Application of 20 microliter of the mixture reduced embryonic survival by nearly 70%. The temporal pattern of embryonic death was similar to that after exposure to South Louisiana crude oil. Embryonic growth was stunted, as reflected by weight, crown-rump length, and bill length, and there was a significant increase in the incidence of abnormal survivors. When individual classes of aromatic hydrocarbons were tested, tetracyclics caused some embryonic death at the concentrations in the mixture. When classes were tested in all possible combinations of two, no combination appeared to be as toxic as the entire mixture. Addition of the tetracyclic compound chrysene to the aromatic mixture considerably enhanced embryotoxicity, but could not completely account for the toxicity of the crude oil. The presence of additional unidentified polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as methylated derivatives of polycyclic aromatic compounds such as chrysene may further account for the embryotoxicity of the crude oil.
1337	394683	Effect of waterfowl (Anas platyrhynchos) on indicator bacteria populations in a recreational lake Madison, Wisconsin.	Standridge JH, Delfino JJ, Kleppe LB, Butler R	Appl Environ Microbiol	 1979 Sep;38(3):547-50	 doi: 101128/aem383547-5501979	A public swimming beach in Madison, wis., experienced intermittent high fecal coliform counts during the late summer and early fall of 1978. Public health officials closed the beach on a number of occasions. A public health survey identified a combination of waterfowl wastes and meteorological events as the explanation for the high bacteria counts. Fecal coliform bacteria were deposited by mallard ducks and multiplied in the beach sands. The bacteria were subsequently transported into the lake and resulted in high fecal coliform counts in the swimming area.
1338	464101	Noncholinergic vasodilator innervation in the feet of ducks.	McGregor DD	Am J Physiol	 1979 Aug;237(2):H112-7	 doi: 101152/ajpheart19792372H112	Vasomotor responses to nerve stimulation were studied in the feet of Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus). The birds were killed and the feet isolated and perfused with a Krebs solution. Electrical stimulation of pedal nerves gave vasoconstrictor responses that were abolished by injecting guanethidine and by treating birds with reserpine. After guanethidine or reserpine, nerve stimulation resulted only in vasodilatation, which was unaffected by hexamethonium. Vasodilator responses to nerve stimulation were not blocked by hyoscine or atropine, which blocked responses to acetylcholine, nor by metiamide, which blocked vasodilatation in response to histamine. Responses to nerve stimulation were blocked by tetrodotoxin. Isoprenaline produced vasoconstriction that was blocked by phentolamine and also weak vasodilator responses that were antagonized by propranolol. It is concluded that the vasoconstrictor innervation is adrenergic. The identy of the vasodilator neurotransmitter is unknown; it is apparently not acetylcholine, a catecholamine, or histamine.
1339	24924978	Relationships between the daily variations of social behavior and of plasma FSH, LH and testosterone levels in the domestic duck Anas platyrhynchos L.	Balthazart J, Hendrick JC	Behav Processes	 1979 Jul;4(2):107-28	 doi: 101016/0376-6357(79)90027-5	The daily variations of plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were studied in three groups of 10-12 male domestic ducks at different times in their reproductive cycle. Rapid and significant changes in the mean plasma hormone levels were observed in each case but no reproducible pattern of daily variation could be defined. Before being submitted to repeated blood sampling, the birds were observed for their social behavior on several days from dawn to dusk. The frequencies of social displays and sexual behavior also changed significantly during the day but, once again, the pattern of changes was different from one case to another. There was, however, some indication that the pattern of daily changes could be a function of the season. The study of the relationships between the daily changes in behavior and in plasma hormone levels revealed several significant positive correlations. The variations in plasma FSH and/or testosterone are correlated with the variations in social displays and sexual behavior. Furthermore the same correlations could be detected in different groups of animals which had otherwise completely different patterns of daily variations. This suggests that the short-term changes in behavior could be controlled by these hormones, but it is still unclear whether the changes in hormone levels can cause behavioral changes within hours rather than the converse.
1340	106881	Heterogeneity of delta-crystallins of the embryonic mallard lens. Correlation between subunit compositions and isoelectric points.	Williams LA, Piatigorsky J	Biochemistry	 1979 Apr 17;18(8):1438-42	 doi: 101021/bi00575a008	delta-Crystallins from the lenses of embryonic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were analyzed with respect to native and subunit molecular weight, subunit composition, and isoelectric point. NaDodSO4-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that unfractionated mallard delta-crystallins are composed of approximately equal amounts of subunits with molecular weights near 47 000 and 48 000. Agarose gel chromatography showed that the embryonic mallard delta-crystallins have native molecular weights slightly less than 200 000. Thus, embryonic mallard delta-crystallins appear to be tetramers. Five major and nine minor delta-crystallins were resolved by isoelectric focusing. The five predominant delta-crystallins each cross-reacted with antichick delta-crystallin antiserum, and each had a different proportion of the larger and smaller subunits, indicating a direct relationship between the isoelectric point and the subunit composition. The presence of numerous, minor species of native delta-crystallins with different isoelectric points suggested that the subunits possess charge heteogeneity as well as size heterogeneity.
1341	494303	Elimination of endrin by mallard ducks.	Heinz GH, Johnson RW	Toxicology	 1979 Mar-Apr;12(3):189-96	 doi: 101016/0300-483x(79)90065-9	Endrin is very toxic to birds and has been implicated in the deaths of birds in nature. However, it is not known how rapidly birds eliminate endrin, a factor important in determining how much is accumulated in tissues. In this study, the loss rate of endrin was followed for 64 days in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) drakes that had been fed 20 ppm endrin for 13 days. The loss from carcass and blood was described by the equation Y = a e b square root of x where Y = the concentration of endrin in ppm, a = the concentration at day 0, e = the base of natural logarithms, b = the first order rate constant for the elimination process, and x = the number of days after cessation of endrin treatment. Endrin was lost rapidly at first; concentrations in carcasses on a wet-weight basis decreased by 50% in the first 3 days. Thereafter, endrin was eliminated more slowly; elimination of 50% of the remainder required 8.9 days, and it took 32.9 days to lose 90% of the original amount.
1342	222451	Structural changes occurring in internal tissue of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) following adenohypophysectomy and treatment in vivo and in vitro with corticotropin.	Pearce RB, Cronshaw J, Holmes WN	Cell Tissue Res	 1979 Feb 28;196(3):429-47	 doi: 101007/BF00234738	Adrenal glands from ACTH-treated intact ducks and chronically adenohypophysectomized ducks showed clear zonation into a subcapsular zone (SCZ) and an inner zone (IZ). Adenohypophysectomy caused ultrastructural changes in the IZ but not in the SCZ cells. These included increases in lipid droplets, changes in mitochondrial cristae from tubular to shelf-like, and changes in the shape of the nuclei from spherical to crenated. These changes were reversed by treatment with ACTH. Also, cells of the IZ, but not the SCZ, of adrenals from intact birds given ACTH showed more SER, more dense bodies, fewer lipid droplets and more prominent Golgi complexes. IZ cells incubated in buffer containing no ACTH developed mitochondria with shelf-like cristae and numerous opaque granules in the matrix. Exposure to buffer containing ACTH caused the mitochondrial cristae to become tubular and the matrix granules either decreased in number or disappeared. The granules could be extracted by incubating sections with chelating agents. The mitochondria in SCZ cells did not respond structurally to the presence of ACTH in the incubation medium but the matrix granules, like those in IZ cells, responded to the presence of chelating agents.
1343	533519	In vitro binding of radioiodinated rat follicle-stimulating hormone to the testis of the mallard duck, Anas platyrhynchos l.	Bortolussi M, Deviche P, Colombo L, Marini G	Basic Appl Histochem	 1979;23(4):279-84		The binding of 125I-labelled rat FSH to homogenates and frozen sections of mallard duck testis was investigated. The equilibrium association constant (Ka) in the homogenates (8.5 x 10(9) M-1) was similar to those reported in other avian and mammalian species. Autoradiography suggested that the binding sites for the labelled hormone were localized in the tubular compartment.

1345	219636	Effects of testosterone propionate and pituitary-adrenal hormones on the social behaviour of male ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos L.) in two test situations.	Deviche P	Z Tierpsychol	 1979 Jan;49(1):77-86	 doi: 101111/j1439-03101979tb00276x	This experiment was designed to study in male ducklings the behavioural influence of testosterone propionate (= TP) injections, combined with pituitary-adrenal hormones administration, in two test situations: in groups of birds from the same residence cage or from visually isolated cages. It appears from the results that TP administration increased sexual but not aggressive behaviour, while pituitary-adrenal hormones induced very few effects. The responses of the birds were however modulated to a large extent by the type of test situation.
1346	102665	The central projections of the glossopharyngeal and vagus ganglia in the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos L.	Dubbeldam JL, Brus ER, Menken SB, Zeilstra S	J Comp Neurol	 1979 Jan 1;183(1):149-68	 doi: 101002/cne901830111	The central projections of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves in the mallard have been studied with the Fink-Heimer I method and are compared to those of the trigeminal and facial nerves. The N. vagus projects ipsilaterally and contralaterally upon the central nuclei of the solitary complex, except the most rostral part of it, upon the n. sulcalis dorsalis, the parasolitary nuclei and the n. commissuralis. The glossopharyngeal nerve contributes to the rostral pole of the n. centralis anterior and to the n. ventrolateralis anterior of the solitary complex, but it has also terminal fields in a cellgroup sIX of the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, in a small cellgroup sIXd on the dorsum of the descending trigeminal tract, in the n. interpolaris of this tract and in nuclei of the cuneate complex. There is hardly any overlap of the respective terminal fields. The convergence of projections from N VII and N IX can be connected with the presence of tastebuds in upper and lower bill and in the soft palate. The converging projections from N V and N IX in "trigeminal" nuclei may reflect the functional coherence of the mechanoreceptors in bill and tongue. It is suggested that these nuclei play a role in the feeding behavior.
1347	318528	Effects of chronic ingestion of south Louisiana crude oil on mallard ducklings.	Szaro RC, Dieter MP, Heinz GH, Ferrell JF	Environ Res	 1978 Dec;17(3):426-36	 doi: 101016/0013-9351(78)90046-4	South Louisiana crude oil was fed to duckling mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in concentrations of 0.025, 0.25, 2.5, and 5.0% of the diet from hatching to 8 weeks of age to assess the effects of chronic oil ingestion during early development. Growth was depressed in birds receiving a diet containing 5% oil but there was no oil-related mortality. Diets containing 0.25, 2.5, and 5.0% oil impaired avoidance behavior of 6-day-old mallard ducklings when compared with controls or ducklings fed 0.025% oil, but had no effect on open-field behavior of 7-day-old ducklings. Liver hypertrophy and splenic atrophy were gross evidence of the pathological effects of oil in birds on the 2.5 and 5.0% oil diets. Biochemical lesions that occurred included elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase and ornithine carbamyl transferase activity. Hepatocyte hypertrophy and bile duct proliferation in the liver were noted in birds fed the 2.5 and 5.0% oil diets and tubular inflammation and degeneration in the kidney were noted in birds fed the 5.0% oil diet.
1348	722682	The effects of ingested petroleum on oviposition and some aspects of reproduction in experimental colonies of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Holmes WN, Cavanaugh KP, Cronshaw J	J Reprod Fertil	 1978 Nov;54(2):335-47	 doi: 101530/jrf00540335	Compared to unmated mallard ducks fed an uncontaminated diet, unmated birds given food contaminated with 3 ml South Louisiana crude oil per 100 g dry weight showed an 84% decline in the daily rate of oviposition, a 33% decrease in egg-shell thickness and at autopsy more than 82% of the ovarian mass consisted of atretic follicles. Similar studies on groups of mated females showed that although the addition of 1 ml South Louisiana crude oil/100 g dry food had no effect on the daily rate of oviposition, none of the eggs had been fertilized while a concentration of 3 ml South Louisiana crude oil/100 g dry food suppressed the daily rate of oviposition significantly. Less than 25% of these eggs had been fertilized and only 40% of the fertilized eggs yielded viable ducklings. In both of these groups of mated birds, normal patterns of oviposition, fertilization and hatchability were restored after removal of petroleum from the diet. The addition of 1 ml Kuwait crude oil/100 g dry food had no effect on the rate of oviposition, the incidence of fertility or the hatchability of the fertilized eggs. The addition of 3 ml oil/100 g dry food completely abolished oviposition, but a normal rate of oviposition was restored when the concentration of the crude oil was reduced from 3 to 1 ml/100 g dry food. However, the incidence of fertilization remained low and none of the fertilized eggs gave rise to viable ducklings. Kuwait crude oil had no effect on shell thickness.
1349	749896	Experimental and natural infections of Eustrongylides sp. (Nematoda: Dioctophymatidae) in waterfowl and shore birds.	Cooper CL, Crites JL, Fastzkie JS	Avian Dis	 1978 Oct-Dec;22(4):790-2		The occurrence of Eustrongylides sp. is reported for five species of fish-eating birds collected in the western-basin region of Lake Erie. Mature specimens of E. tubifex were recovered from 5 of 74 laboratory-reared Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected experimentally with larval worms taken from Yellow perch, Perca flavescens.
1350	318512	Some effects of ingested petroleum on seawater-adapted ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Holmes WN, Cronshaw J, Gorsline J	Environ Res	 1978 Oct;17(2):177-90	 doi: 101016/0013-9351(78)90020-8	Male Pekin ducks adapted to seawater and maintained under sheltered conditions (27 degrees C) in the laboratory may consume considerable volumes of petroleum without showing overt symptoms of distress. Under these conditions, birds consuming petroleum-contaminated food have shown a persistent hyperphagia; this was most apparent among those given food contaminated with South Louisiana crude oil, least apparent among birds given No. 2 fuel oil, and intermediate among those that consumed food contaminated with Kuwait crude oil. When maintained at 27 degrees C, some mortality occurred among the birds given South Louisiana crude oil (22.2%) and No. 2 fuel oil (35.7%), whereas none of the freshwater- and seawater-maintained birds given uncontaminated food and none of the birds given Kuwait crude oil died during this period. Following their exposure to chronic mild cold stress (3 degrees C), mortality occurred in all groups of birds; the birds that had consumed petroleum-contaminated food tended to die earlier and in larger numbers than either the seawater- or freshwater-maintained control birds. These effects suggest that the mortality in all groups of birds was due primarily to the additive effects of a series of nonspecific stressors. Thus, at autopsy, birds that had succumbed to the effects of these stressors frequently showed adrenal hypertrophy and severe involution of the lymphoepithelial tissues. The consumption of petroleum-contaminated food seemed to constitute only one of a series of environmental stressors, and, among birds that were already exposed to stressors such as hypertonic drinking water and persistent cold, the ingestion of petroleum seemed to render them more vulnerable and death frequently ensued.
1351	699022	Evidence for the zonation of interrenal tissue in the adrenal gland of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Pearce RB, Cronshaw J, Holmes WN	Cell Tissue Res	 1978 Sep 26;192(3):363-79	 doi: 101007/BF00212319	Although interrenal tissue from the intact duck does not show a clear zonation when examined by light microscopy, the tissue does develop a well defined zonation following exposure to high and low levels of corticotropic stimulation. Under these conditions clear ultrastructural differences are seen between cells of the subcapsular zone (SCZ) and the inner zone (IZ). Based on these observations, the ultrastructure of tissue from intact birds was examined retrospectively and in addition, cell sizes and the relative volumes and areas of intracellular components were measured morphometrically. These analyses reveal morphological and quantitative differences between cells from the IZ and the SCZ. Cells of the IZ have small rounded nuclei, extensive smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and mitochondria with tubular cristae, whereas cells from the SCZ contain pleomorphic nuclei, less SER and mitochondria with shelf-like cristae. The mean cell volume in the IZ is significantly less than that in the SCZ. In the SCZ cells the volume densities (volume per unit volume cytoplasm) of mitochondria and lipid droplets and the surface densities (area per unit volume cytoplasm) of the outer mitochondrial membranes are significantly greater than those in IZ cells. Conversely, in the cells of the IZ the volume densities of the nuclei and dense bodies and the surface density of the SER are greater than the corresponding values estimated for the cells of the SCZ. Although the mitochondria comprise a smaller fraction of the mean volume of IZ cells than SCZ cells, the total surface area of the cristae is approximately the same in the cells of both zones.
1352	718435	Structure and blood supply of the heart valves of several domestic and wild birds	Sokolov VV	Arkh Anat Gistol Embriol	 1978 Sep;75(9):72-7		By means of a complex technique some structural and blood supply peculiarities of the valve apparatus have been studied in 118 hearts of 8 representatives of domestic (Anser domesticus, Anas domestica) and wild (Cygnus olor, Cygnus sygnus, Chenopsis atrata, Anser anser, Anas platyrhynchos, Anas strepera) waterfowls. The investigations have demonstrated that in all the waterfowl studied the right atrioventricular ostia have only one cusp consisting mainly of transversal-striated muscular fibers. In the muscular valve, a dense vascular network and elements of the conducting system--Purkine's fibers have been determined. The main bulk of blood vessels penetrate the left atrio-ventricular valve, the aortal and pulmonary stem valves having transversal-striated muscular fibers. A part of vessels can be detected in the connective tissue stroma of the valves. In wild birds, the valve cusps possess more powerful bundles of muscular fibers and a much denser capillary network.
1353	702032	Cytophysiologic differentiation in the epithelial region of the uropygial gland in the duck embryo Anas platyrhynchos	Bride J	J Embryol Exp Morphol	 1978 Aug;46:21-35		The uropygial gland (preen gland), an epidermal derivative, is a bilobed, lipid-secreting gland located over the base of the tail of most birds. In the duck embryo Anas platyrhynchos, the internal branching morphogenesis of preen gland is set up at the 17th day of incubation. Each glandular lobe is made of numerous epidermal columns each of which is terminated by a bulb or end-bud. The functional differentiation of the end-buds and the development of the cellular columns into collecting ducts were investigated. The ductal epithelium, separated from the mesoderm by a continuous basal lamina, is keratinized just as in normal embryonic avian epidermis. The features which indicate glandular differentiation in the end-buds were described. Lipogenesis results from progressive cellular differentiation characterized by proliferation and development of smooth membranes. The direct ecto-mesodermal contacts, which were observed at the end-buds after the establishment of morphogenetic pattern and before the onset of glandular secretory activity, suggest that a new interaction mechanism would be required to initiate the functional differentiation.
1354	569405	Behavioural and physiological effects of testosterone propionate and cyproterone acetate in immature male domestic ducks, Anas platyrhynchos.	Balthazart J	Z Tierpsychol	 1978 Aug;47(4):410-21	 doi: 101111/j1439-03101978tb01845x	The behavioural and morphological effects of testosterone propionate and of the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate were studied in male domestic ducks. Testosterone was also measured by radioimmunoassay in the plasma of these birds to relate the behaviour to the actual circulating levels of hormone. Testosterone stimulates sexual behaviour but has few effects on social displays. There is no correlation between the individual variations of plasma testosterone and sexual behaviour.
1355	98622	Experimental transmission of Sarcocystis from icterid birds to sparrows and canaries by sporocysts from the opossum.	Box ED, Duszynski DW	J Parasitol	 1978 Aug;64(4):682-8		Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and grackles (Cassidix mexicanus) infected with muscle cysts of Sarcocystis were fed to opposums (Didelphis virginiana) and fecal sporocysts from the latter were given to sparrows (Passer domesticus, Family Ploceidae), canaries (Serinus canarius, Family Fringillidae) and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos, Family Anatidae). Asexual parasites were found in the endothelium of sparrows and canaries but not in ducks. When birds were kept 10 weeks or more after infection, muscle cysts were found grossly and microscopically in the majority of sparrows, and in 1 canary, but not in ducks. Muscle zoites were found in digests of all sparrows and canaries but not in that of ducks. Metrocytes and forms dividing by endodyogeny also were found in the digest. Thus, avian Sarcocystis was transmitted experimentally from 2 genera of 1 family (Icteridae) to 2 different families of passerine intermediate hosts by sporocysts from the definitive host. This is the broadest intermediate host spectrum known for a species of Sarcocystis.
1356	705813	Corticosteroid receptors in the avian kidney.	Charest-Boule L, Mehdi AZ, Sandor T	Steroids	 1978 Jul-Aug;32(1):109-26	 doi: 101016/0039-128x(78)90104-6	The binding in vitro of tritiated aldosterone to domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) kidney tissue has been investigated. Using tissue from animals on a normal diet, tritiated aldosterone was specifically bound to kidney cytosol with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of about 9 nM and number of binding sites in the 20 fmol/mg protein range. These values did not show statistically significant changes when the cytosol originated from animals with salt activated nasal glands. Kidney cytosols labeled with tritiated aldosterone sedimented with a single peak at 8S in a linear sucrose gradient (10--30%) and this peak was quenched by excess, radioinert aldosterone. Following incubation of labeled cytosols with crude nuclei, the cytosols became depleted of the label and aldosterone was translocated to the Tris-soluble and Tris-insoluble, 0.4 M KC1 soluble nuclear fractions. Kidney cytosols metabolized aldosterone extensively to a compound presumed to be 3alpha,5beta-tetrahydroaldosterone. However, only unchanged aldosterone became receptor-bound. It was concluded that the duck kidney possesses aldosterone receptors, though competition studies indicated that the specificity of these receptors might be different from those described in the mammalian kidney.
1357	29468	Isolation of influenza virus from wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	Gresikova M, Tumova B, Stumpa A, Sekeyova M	Acta Virol	 1978 Jul;22(4):296-301		In the course of studies on influenza virus ecology, Influenzavirus A was isolated from a cloacal smear from a wild duck (Anas platyrhynchos) caught in west Slovakia. The strain was identified as A(Hav7Nav1). The results of virus isolation experiments from other species of aquatic and other small birds were negative.
1358	660564	Transmission of salmonid whirling disease by birds fed trout infected with Myxosoma cerebralis.	Taylor RL, Lott M	J Protozool	 1978 Feb;25(1):105-6	 doi: 101111/j1550-74081978tb03876x	Mallard ducks, Anas platyrhynchos and a black crested night heron, Nycticorax nycticorax were fed trout infected with Myxosoma cerebralis (HOFER) in 2 separate experiments. Feces from the birds were deposited in troughs containing M. cerebralis-free mud as well as in 1 trough without mud. Spore suspensions were also added directly to mud in 1 trough and to another without mud. Susceptible rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, developed whirling disease in all troughs containing mud contaminated with M. cerebralis but remained free of infection when exposed to M. cerebralis in troughs without mud. This demonstrates the possibility of bird transmission of the organism causing whirling disease to previously non-contaminated waters.
1359	632731	The effect of hybridization on the embryonic germ cell population and the young females produced by the crossing of a male Peking duck with a female Barbary duck (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina moschata)	Deray A	J Embryol Exp Morphol	 1978 Feb;43:1-16		Ovarian development has been studied in a hybrid duck (Anas platyrhynchos male x Cairina moschata female) and in females of the parental Peking and Barbary species. In the hybrid, the gonadal ridge when it first forms is smaller than in either parental species, and after 16 days of incubation there is less cortical growth and less oogonial proliferation. At hatching, the left ovary of the hybrid contains fewer follicles, perhaps because the reduced size of the hybrid gonadal ridge limits germ cell colonization. However, the hybrid follicles develop very rapidly after hatching, and laying begins earlier in the hybrid than in Peking and Barbary ducks.
1360	633403	Influence of laying on lead accumulation in bone of mallard ducks.	Finley MT, Dieter MP	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1978 Jan;4(1):123-9	 doi: 101080/15287397809529649	Paired mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were given No. 4 lead shot, and bone lead concentrations were compared in drakes and in laying and nonlaying hens. Lead accumulation was significantly greater in bones with a high medullary content (femur and sternum) compared with bones with a lower medullary content (ulna-radius or wingbones). In dosed groups, hens always contained higher bone lead residues than drakes. After dosage with one shot (approximately 200 mg lead), lead in femurs of laying hens averaged 488.4 ppm compared with 113.6 ppm in nonlaying hens. Femurs of drakes averaged 9.4 ppm lead. Dosage with the second lead shot did not result in further accumulation of bone lead in hens, but increased bone lead concentrations threefold in drakes, suggesting that saturation levels for bone lead had already been reached in the hens after ingestion of one shot. There was no demonstrable relationship between egg production and bone lead residues. The high lead residues, found in medullary bones of laying hens indicate that sex and physiological condition are major factors influencing lead absorption by bone.
1361	414848	Presence of neurons synthesizing LH-RH in the anterior hypothalamus of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos)	Bons N, Kerdelhue B, Assenmacher I	C R Acad Hebd Seances Acad Sci D	 1977 Nov 28;285(15):1327-30		Using histochemical techniques with LH-RH anti-serum, a large number of LH-RH producing neurons were identified in the Duck hypothalamus, under different physiological conditions. The LH-RH pericaryas were localized in a well delimited area of the anterior hypothalamus, including the dorsal part of the periventricular preoptic nucleus. The LH-RH containing axons were directed downwards towards the infundibulum, and terminated within the external layer of the rostral and caudal median eminence, in close vicinity to the capillaries of the pituitary portal system.
1362	924873	Isolation of type A influenza and Newcastle disease viruses from migratory waterfowl in the Mississippi flyway.	Bahl AK, Pomeroy BS, Mangundimedjo S, Easterday BC	J Am Vet Med Assoc	 1977 Nov 1;171(9):949-51		Twenty-seven chicken red blood cell agglutinating agents were isolated from 187 tracheal swabbings of apparently healthy migratory mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) in the Mississippi flyway. Twenty-four of the isolants were type A influenza virus; 3 lentogenic Newcastle disease viruses were isolated. Isolations were not made from either 65 giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis) or 60 Franklins' gulls (Larus pipixcan).
1363	24228965	EXPERIMENTAL EXPOSURE OF FRANKLINS' GULLS ( Larvus pipixcan ) AND MALLARDS ( Anas platyrhynchos ) TO A TURKEY INFLUENZA A VIRUS A/Turkey/Minn/BF/72 (Hav6Neq2).	Bahl AK, Pomeroy BS	J Wildl Dis	 1977 Oct;13(4):420-6	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-134420	Gulls ( Larvus pipixcan ) and mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ) were experimentally exposed to a turkey influenza A isolant, A/turkey/Minn/BF/72 (Hav6Neq 2). No clinical signs of disease were observed in either species. Tracheal shedding of virus from the gulls persisted for 24 days post-inoculation but virus later than 6 days post exposure could not be demonstrated in either tracheal or cloacal samples from the mallards. Precipitating antibodies were not detected. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies were demonstrated in inoculated gulls but antibody levels were low and erratic in ducks.
1364	920280	The mutual relations of structures in the growing bill of chick (Gallus domesticus L.) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos L.) Embryos. IV. The size, shape, and position of the upper and lower bills in unilaterally microphthalmic duck embryos.	Wouterlood FG	Acta Morphol Neerl Scand	 1977 Oct;15(3):161-83		Unilaterally microphthalmic duck (DUM) embryos studied in stage 39 were obtained by damaging the right eye in stage 17. The development between stages 19 and 39 was observed in samples. After prolonged incubation, one duck hatched and reached adulthood. In DUM embryos partial crossbeak develops. Both the upper and lower bills deviate lateralwards, the upper bill more than the lower. In stage 39 a small orbit is present on the treated side. In stained and cleared heads most of the elements of the skull (the bones surrounding the orbit, the brain-case, and the upper and lower bill elements) are translated in the direction of the rudimentary orbit on the treated side. The bills are twisted around each other at the tip. Measurements of external dimensions as well as those made in stained and cleared stage-39 DUM heads show elongation of the left part of the lower bill. Except for the crossed bills, the changes found in the embryos persisted in the adult. The findings support a hypothesis concerning the mutual influence of bills during morphogenesis. The coherence of the functional cranial components in the embryo is discussed.
1365	922833	The fine structure of the interrenal cells of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) with evidence for possible exocytotic release of steroids.	Pearce RB, Cronshaw J, Holmes WN	Cell Tissue Res	 1977 Sep 26;183(2):203-20	 doi: 101007/BF00226620	The duck interrenal cell possesses ultrastructural characteristics common to other steroid-secreting cells. Lipid droplets and mitochondria are abundant and lie principally at the apical end of the cell. Lipid droplets are not membrane-limited. Cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum that are occasionally continuous with the less abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum are a prominent feature of the interrenal cell. Tubular profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum often lie tangentially to mitochondria and ribosomes are either free, grouped in polyribosomal clusters, or bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria possess tubular cristae in the inner regions of the gland and frequently contain a paracrystalline array of small 10nm (o.d.) tubules and less frequently a hexagonal array of 40 nm trilaminar rings. Other cytoplasmic components include dense bodies, residual bodies, microtubules, microfilaments and specialized single membrane-bound vesicles. Gap junctions, intermediate junctions and interdigitating processes constitute the main intercellular associations. No tight junctions were identified. The single membrane-bound vesicles which are occasionally filled with a low electron-dense, lipid-like material form septate-like "junctions" with the plasma membrane. The septa bridge an intracellular gap of 15-17 nm. The vesicles are usually located near the subendothelial space at the basal and basilateral regions of the cell. Occasionally, vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane. It is suggested that these vesicles represent morphological evidence for the exocytotic release of steroid hormones.
1366	17790773	Sociobiology of Rape in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos): Responses of the Mated Male.	Barash DP	Science	 1977 Aug 19;197(4305):788-9	 doi: 101126/science1974305788	Male mallards respond to rapes of their mate by intervening aggressively against the rapist or rapists, by attempting to force a copulation with the rape victim, or both. Aggressive intervention is more likely against a solitary male than against a group, and forced copulations are more likely immediately after a rape and especially when the rape appears to have been successful. This behavior pattern reflects, strategies consistent with maximizing individual male fitness.
1367	332381	Adrenergic control of hypothalamic function during osmotic stress in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Hoffman DL, Abel JH Jr, McNeill TH	Cell Tissue Res	 1977 Aug 9;182(2):177-91	 doi: 101007/BF00220587	The role of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and biogenic amines (BA) in regulating the level of corticoids in the serum of osmotically stressed mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) was analyzed employing three experimental approaches: 1) pharmacologic alteration of central BA levels, 2) microscopic evaluation of BA distribution, and 3) placement of electrolytic lesions into the PVN. Reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alphampt), agents that decrease the amount of BA's in the central nervous system, produced a fivefold increase in the concentration of serum corticoids. Conversely, pargyline and amphetamine, agents that increase the functional pool of BA's, prevented the rise in serum corticoid concentration normally observed in birds challenged with an intraperitoneal injection of hypertonic saline. When the topographic distribution of BA's was analyzed in the brains of osmotically stressed and nonstressed ducks distinct changes in the intensity of catecholamine (CA) fluorescence were observed in only bone location, the PVN of the hypothalamus. Additionally, electrolytic lesions stereotaxically placed in the PVN blocked the osmotic stress-induced rise in serum corticoid concentration. These data therefore indicate that the PVN in the mallard duck plays some role in regulating the observed stress-induced rise in serum corticoid concentration, and that this regulatory function is probably inhibited by catecholamines.
1368	886407	A redescription of Eustrongylides tubifex (Nitzsch 1819) Jagerskiold 1909 (Nematoda: Dioctophymatidae) from mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).	Fastzkie JS, Crites JL	J Parasitol	 1977 Aug;63(4):707-12		Eustrongylides tubifex (Nitzsch 1819) Jagerskiold 1909 is redescribed from six male and 10 female adult specimens from experimental infections in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Our redescription is compared with that of Jagerskiold (1909) and those of the Russian investigators Kontrimavichus and Bakhmeteva (1960) and Karmanova (1968). Our redescription differs in the ranges of total body length, esophageal length, maximum width, spicule length and vagina length. The cuticular fringe and inner rim of small papillae of the male bursa are shown to be definitive species characters. A key to the species of Eustrongylides is included.
1369	410954	Blood parasites of mallard and pintail ducks from central Alberta and the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories.	Williams NA, Calverley BK, Mahrt JL	J Wildl Dis	 1977 Jul;13(3):226-9	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-133226	Blood films from 60 mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and 67 pintail (A. acuta) ducks, collected in Alberta and the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, during 1973 and 1974, were examined for blood parasites. Twenty-two (37%) of the mallards and fourteen (21%) of the pintails were infected with one or more species of hematozoa. Infections of Leucocytozon simondi occurred more frequently (86%) than Haemoproteus nettionis (22%) in the infected birds. Trypanosoma avium occurred in one individual of each species of duck; one pintail harbored an unidentified microfilaria. Differences of prevalence between species are predicted on the basis of host attractancy to vectors and/or host habitat selection, and are discussed.
1370	70093	Problem of the infertility of hybrids of the muscovy (Cairina moschata L.) and the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica)	Steklenev EP, Marinchuk GE	Tsitol Genet	 1977 Mar-Apr;11(2):157-60		Analysis of blood serum proteins electrophoretic spectra for perching and domestic ducks resulted in revealing interspecific differences of prealbumin and transferrin types showing incomplete identity of loci in analogous sites of some homologous chromosomes in the hybridizants. This confirms the genetic nature of sterility in this crossing combination hybrids whose blood serum proteins electrophoretic spectrum displays a complex hybrid phenotype.
1371	596635	Functional anatomy of the feeding apparatus of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.) structure, movement, electro-myography and electro-neurography (author's transl)	Zweers GA, Kunz G, Mos J	Anat Anz	 1977;142(1-2):10-20		A causal model for the functioning of the beakapparatus of the mallard during straining is formulated on a qualitative basis. The starting point for this model is an abstraction of the analysed structure of the muscle, bone, ligament system. The system was studied by electromyography and cinematography of the movements. It was attempted to quantify the model. Connections with neurography are shown.
1372	318250	Anserine and carnosine in chicks (Gallus gallus) rat pups (Rattus rattus) and ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos): comparative ontogenetic observations.	Fisher DE, Amend JF, Strumeyer DH	Comp Biochem Physiol B	 1977;56(4):367-70	 doi: 101016/0305-0491(77)90232-2	1. Muscle and brain from developing chick embryos, as well as from day-old chicks, rats, and ducks were analyzed for the histidine-containing dipeptides, anserine and carnosine. 2. Anserine was found in the brain of all species studied, whereas in muscle, anserine was found only in chicks. 3. At 15 days, the muscle of developing chick embryo contained 41 +/- 9 mumoles/100 g anserine while carnosine was present at a level of less than 3 mumoles/100 g. 4. In day-old chicks the anserine level in muscle was 100 +/- 35 mumoles/100 g while the carnosine level was 22.5 +/- 1 mumoles/100 g. 5. These findings cast doubt on earlier hypotheses relating anserine and carnosine to muscle activity.
1373	145306	Autoradiography after tritiated thymidine labeling of the abortive gametogenesis in hybrid male ducks from the cross male Pekin X female Barbary	Marchand CR, Gomot L, de Reviers M	C R Seances Soc Biol Fil	 1977;171(4):931-4		This autoradiographic data concludes that meiotic prophase of the abortive gametogenesis of the sterile hybride drake (from the mating Peking male = Anas platyrhynchos L. X Barbary female = Cairina moschata L.) lasts 5 days 1/4. 6 days after the injection of the marker the seminiferous tubules contain numerous labeles necrosing cells but never typical elongated spermatids.
1374	145304	Ultrastructure of the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle of ducks (Barbary duck: Cairina moschata, Pekin duck: Anas platyrhynchos	Deray A	C R Seances Soc Biol Fil	 1977;171(4):922-6		In the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle of the ducks, the Golgi apparatus is developed, the granular endoplasmic reticulum is important. Owing to these characters, these cells are probably oriented towards the elaboration of proteins. The seasonal variations of the aspect of these cells are important: in January all organits are not very developed when in May they are all very developed. For a determined season all cells present the same aspect.
1375	142551	The germinal population at embryonic stage and young age in the female hybrid duck born of male Pekin x female Barbary crossing. Comparison with ducks of the parent species	Deray A	C R Seances Soc Biol Fil	 1977;171(2):334-40		As hatching the number of left ovary germinal cells of the female hybrid (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina moschata) is weaker than that of the Peking and Barbary females because the small size of the genital crest limites the number of colonising germinal cells. As well after 16 days of incubation the multiplication of the oogonies stops in a way that we can not explain. The later growth of the ovarian follicle is, however, very fast, and the first laying is earlier than with the female parents.
1376	1002866	Central projections of the chorda tympani nerve in the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos L.	Dubbeldam JL, Karten HJ, Menken SB	J Comp Neurol	 1976 Dec 15;170(4):415-20	 doi: 101002/cne901700402	The central projections of the chorda tympani nerve in the duck were studied by means of the Fink-Heimer technique. Following section of the VIIth nerve proximal to the geniculate ganglion terminal projections of the CT are found in the sensory nucleus N VII (sVIId) on the dorsum of the descending trigeminal root, the n. presulcalis anterior solitarii, the n. sulcalis anterior solitarii p. dorsalis and p. ventralis, and the n. ventrolateralis anterior solitarii (Vla). Small quantities of terminal degeneration are also found in the n. intermedius anterior and the lateral substantia gelatinosa of the solitary complex. A number of fibers decussate to terminate contralaterally in corresponding portions of the opposite solitary complex. Comparison with data of the pigeon reveals a limited overlap of projections of the chorda tympani nerve and of the nodose ganglion, respectively, in the dorsal and ventral parts of the n. sulcalis anterior. We suggest that the regions sVIId and Vla alone may convey gustatory information.
1377	24923744	Behavioural and morphological effects of testosterone and gonadotropins in the young male domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos L.).	Deviche P, Balthazart J	Behav Processes	 1976 Nov;1(3):217-32	 doi: 101016/0376-6357(76)90023-1	Young male domestic ducks 20-72 days old were successively injected with two hormonal preparations. The first hormone treatment included males injected with testosterone propionate (TP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), pregnant mare serum (PMS), control oil injected males (C) and males injected with TP and submitted at the same time to a permanent intense light. During the second hormonal treatment all males except controls were injected with TP. Almost no behavioural effects were observed in any group of males following the first treatment. The second one, however, induced intense social display and sexual behaviour in the four TP-injected groups. Some qualitative and quantitative differences were found between groups according to the first hormone treatment to which they had been submitted. This suggests a possible role of gonadotropic hormones in the control of social behaviour in ducks. Experimental data supporting this hypothesis are briefly reviewed and discussed.
1378	791639	Neurosecretory pathways in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) brain: localization by aldehyde fuchsin and immunoperoxidase techniques for neurophysin (NP) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone (Gn-RH).	McNeill T, Kozlowski GP, Abel JH, Zimmerman EA	Endocrinology	 1976 Nov;99(5):1323-32	 doi: 101210/endo-99-5-1323	Localization studies of the hypothalamohypophysial and tuberoinfundibular neurosecretory systems were performed in the adult male mallard duck with an immunoperoxidase techinque for the demonstration of neurophysin (NP) and gonado-tropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) and with aldehyde fuchsin for the staining of neuosecretory material (NSM). A comparison was made between the distribution of NSM stained with aldehyde fuchsin and NP seen by immunocytochemistry. The magnocellular perikarya of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei, the zona externa of the anterior median eminence (ME), the fiber layer of both the anterior and posterior ME, and small neurons in the tractus quintofrontalis were stained by both the immunoperoxidase method for NP and by the aldehyde fuchsin stain. In contrast, the parvocellular neurons of the PVN, extra-hypothalamic neurosecretory fibers dorsal to the anterior commissure in the septal region and tanycytes lining the ventral 1/3 of the third ventricle at the level of the anterior ME, were stained only by the immunocytochemical procedure for NP. These observations indicate that immunocytochemistry is more sensitive than aldehyde fuchsin staining for detecting low concentrations of NP in cells and tissues, but the two techniques produce comparable results where the concentration of the NP is relatively high. Two populations of beaded axons containing Gn-RH were distributed throughout the zone externa of both the anterior and posterior ME. One group of fibers paralleled the hypothalamo-hypophysial neurosecretory tract whereas the other was distributed in the contact zone of the ME. Immunoreactive Gn-RH was found in the cytoplasm of a sparse population of cell bodies in the dorsolateral portion of the arcuate nucleus as well as in the axons that project from this nucleus ventrally towards the ME.

Female Peking duck (Anas platyrhynchos)	Deray A	C R Seances Soc Biol Fil	 1976 Oct;170(3):588-95		The cells making up the thick internal theca of the follicle of the Peking duck and which contain an active 3 beta HSDH enzyme have a developed smooth reticulum, tubular crested mitochondria, a considerable load in slightly osmiophilic lipid inclusions; all of these characteristics are those of steroid cells. Various physiological states of these cells juxtapose themselves in different proportions according to the season.
1380	988551	The turnover and distribution of labelled corticosterone during post-natal development of the duckling (Anas platyrhynchos).	Holmes WN, Kelly ME	Pflugers Arch	 1976 Sep 30;365(2-3):145-50	 doi: 101007/BF01067011	During 6 months of post-natal development in the laboratory, the weight of the adrenal gland relative to body weight decreases exponentially. In the 3 day-old duckling a single intravenous dose of labelled corticosterone becomes distributed in a very large apparent volume and an "extracellular" pool that is greater than the extracellular fluid volume and the pattern of disappearance of labelled hormone from plasma is biphasic. Later during development the volumes of distribution decrease and the biphasic pattern of disappearance becomes less distinct until at 6 months only one phase of disappearance can be detected with confidence. No significant change in plasma corticosterone concentration occurs during this period of development in the laboratory. Estimations of the corticosterone secretory rates, however, indicate that whereas the adrenal weight-specific rate os secretion increases during the first 3 weeks and declines therafter, the bodyf weight-specific secretory rate continues to decline throughtout the period of increasing body weight.
1381	1028452	Abortive spermatogenesis in the hybrid duck (cross of male Anas platyrhynchos and female Cairina moschata). Ultrastructural study	Marchand CR, Gomot L	Bull Assoc Anat (Nancy)	 1976 Sep;60(170):613-22		The ultrastructural study of the abortive spermatogenesis of the hybrid drake (cross: male Anas platyrhynchos L. X female Cairina moschata L.) shows the following characteristics: 1) deep anomalies during the pachytene stage (meiotic prophase) where the chromosomes form more or less irregular packs close to the nuclear enveloppe; 2) the total lack of 2nd spermatocytes and in their place were found: --either some cells with lobed or fragmented nuclei in a cytoplasm filled with numerous annulate lamella, lipid droplets and centrioles, --or necrosing cells, with vacuolised chromatin close to the inner side of the nucleus and with abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum vesicles and dark mitochondria; 3) numerous Sertoli cells overloaded with lysosomes. The mitochondria of the spermatogonia, the basal membrane of seminiferous tubules and the Leydig cells have the same structure that exists in the fertile Barbary drake testis.
1382	995813	Metabolic responses of White Pekin ducks to ambient temperature.	Hagan AA, Heath JE	Poult Sci	 1976 Sep;55(5):1899-905	 doi: 103382/ps0551899	Metabolic responses of unrestrained White Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos, were determined at ambient temperatures of -5 degrees, 1 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees C. Temperatures from the pectoralis and the subcutaneous back were monitored. Unrestrained ducks exhibited two metabolic states, a high response (540 cc. O2/kg/hr. at 20 degrees C.) and a low response (427 cc. O2/kg./hr. at 20 degrees C). Pectoralis muscle temperature did not vary greatly over the range of ambient temperatures tested and was considered to be a good representative of body temperature.
1383	974275	Lead in tissues of mallard ducks dosed with two types of lead shot.	Finley MT, Dieter MP, Locke LN	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	 1976 Sep;16(3):261-9	 doi: 101007/BF01685887	Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were sacrificed one month after ingesting one number 4 all-lead shot or one number 4 lead-iron shot. Livers, kidneys, blood, wingbones, and eggs were analyzed for lead by atomic absorption. Necropsy of sacrificed ducks failed to reveal any of the tissue lesions usually associated with lead poisoning in waterfowl. Lead levels in ducks given all-lead shot averaged about twice those in ducks given lead-iron shot, reflecting the amount of lead in the two types of shot. Lead in the blood of ducks dosed with all-lead shot averaged 0.64 ppm, and 0.28 ppm in ducks given lead-iron shot. Lead residues in livers and kidneys of females given all-lead shot were significantly higher than in males. In both dosed groups, lead levels in wingbones of females were about 10 times those in males, and were significantly correlated with the number of eggs laid after dosage. Lead levels in contents and shells of eggs laid by hens dosed with all-lead shot were about twice those in eggs laid by hens dosed with lead-iron shot. Eggshells were found to best reflect levels of lead in the blood. Our results indicate that mallards maintained on a balanced diet and dosed with one lead shot may not accumulate extremely high lead levels in the liver and kidney. However, extremely high lead deposition may result in the bone of laying hens after ingesting sublethal amounts of lead shot as a result of mobilization of calcium from the bone during eggshell formation.
1384	134641	DDE feeding and plasma osmoregulation in ducks, guillemots, and puffins.	Miller DS, Kinter WB, Peakall DB, Risebrough RW	Am J Physiol	 1976 Aug;231(2):370-6	 doi: 101152/ajplegacy19762312370	To assess the possibility that organochlorine pesticide disruption of osmoregulation is responsible for recent large kills of young seabirds, we have studied the effects of DDE feeding (10-250 ppm) on plasma osmoregulation and nasal gland function in the following species: mallared and white Pekin ducks (both Anas platyrhynchos), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), and common (Fratercula arctica). Other investigators have recently reported that dietary DDE (10-1,000 ppm) inhibits nasal gland secretion in freshwater-maintained mallards; our initial experiments with white Pekins showed no such inhibition during either freshwater or seawater maintainance. Moreover, DDE had minimal effects on plasma electrolyte levels and total nasal gland Na-K-ATPase activities in all species studied. Liver DDE levels in experimental ducks and guillemots were comparable to those reported for seabirds found dead after kills; levels in starved experimental puffins were much higher. Thus DDE at environmental levels does not affect osmoregulation or nasal gland Na-K-ATPase either in ducks or in two species of oceanic birds.
1385	132447	Sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase of the nasal salt gland of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Purification, characterization, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the phosphorylating polypeptide.	Hopkins BE, Wagner H Jr, smith TW	J Biol Chem	 1976 Jul 25;251(14):4365-71		Sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (NaK-ATPase) was purified from nasal salt glands of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Enzyme of specific activity 2,000 to 2,300 mumol of Pi/mg/hour was routinely obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment of a microsomal fraction of gland homogenate in the presence of 3 mM ATP followed by pelleting of the enzyme through a sucrose density gradient. Purified NaK-ATPase was stable for over 3 months at -20 degree. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography purified NaK-ATPase was shown to contain two polypeptide chains of molecular weight 94,000 and 60,000, the smaller of which was a glycoprotein. Purified enzyme of activity 2,300 mumol of Pi/mg/hour bound 3,600 pmol of ouabain/mg of enzyme protein. Reaction with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ gave 7,025 pmol of acyl phosphate/mg of enzyme protein. The turnover number calculated from phosphorylation data was 5,460 min-1. Amino acid analysis of the polypeptide components of duck salt gland enzyme after separation by gel filtration chromatography in sodium dodecyl sulfate demonstrated strong compositional homology with highly purified NaK-ATPase preparations from other organs and species. The NH2-terminal amino acid of the 94,000-dalton component was glycine and of the 60,000-dalton component, alanine. With a combination of manual sequencing and automated Edman degradation, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 94,00-dalton catalytic subunit was found to be Gly-Arg-Asn-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Thr-Thr-Ala-()-Ser-Glu.
1386	966321	Sublethal effects of chronic lead ingestion in mallard ducks.	Finley MT, Dieter MP, Locke LN	J Toxicol Environ Health	 1976 Jul;1(6):929-37	 doi: 101080/15287397609529395	Mallard drakes (Anas platyrhynchos) fed 1, 5, or 25 ppm lead nitrate were bled and sacrificed at 3-wk intervals. No mortality occurred, and the pathologic lesions usually associated with lead poisoning were not found. Changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration did not occur. After 3-wk ducks fed 25 ppm lead exhibited a 40% inhibition of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity that persisted through 12 wk exposure. After 12 wk treatment similar enzyme inhibition was present in the ducks fed 5 ppm lead. At 3 wk there was a small accumulation of lead (less than 1 ppm) in the liver and kidneys of ducks fed 25ppm lead; no further increases occurred throughout the exposure. No significant accumulation of lead occurred the the tibiae or wing bones. Groups of ducks fed 5 and 25 ppm diets for 12 wk were placed on clean feed and examined through a 12 wk posttreatment period. After 3 wk on clean diet delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity and lead concentrations in the blood had returned to pretreatment levels. Even though lead concentrations in the blood, soft organs and bone were low, a highly significant negative correlation between blood lead and blood enzyme activity was obtained. This enzyme bioassay should provide a sensitive and precise estimate for monitoring lead in the blood for waterflow.
1387	940735	Mercury in eggs of aquatic birds, Lake St. Clair--1973.	Stendell RC, Ohlendorf HM, Klaas EE, Elder JB	Pestic Monit J	 1976 Jun;10(1):7-9		Eggs from four species of aquatic birds inhabiting waterways of the Lake St. Clair region were collected in 1973 and analyzed for mercury. Species analyzed were mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), common terns (Sterna hirundo), black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), and great egrets (Casmerodius albus). Mallard eggs contained relatively low residue levels, less than 0.05-0.26 ppm, and common tern eggs contained the highest residues, ranging up to 1.31 ppm. Mercury levels in the eggs were appreciably lower than those in the same species in 1970. The declines are attributed to the 1970 restrictions placed on industrial discharges of mercury into the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers.
1388	1277273	Retinohypothalamic pathway in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos).	Bons N	Cell Tissue Res	 1976 May 13;168(3):343-60	 doi: 101007/BF00215312	Retinohypothalamic connections were studied in the duck after unilateral optic nerve transection using both light and electron microscopic techniques. Degenerated endings of optic fibers were found only in a circumscribed part of the anterior hypothalamic area, i.e. the ventral region of the contralateral suprachiasmatic nucleus. Images of degenerating boutons were observed in frozen sections (method according to Johnstone-Bowsher), and their presence confirmed by electron microscopic examination. These degenerating boutons make synaptic contacts with dendrites or dendritic spines of neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In the same material, the decussation of the optic chiasma was studied with the light microscope. Uncrossed retinal fibers were found in the marginal optic tract, the basal optic root and occasionally also inthe isthmo-optic tract.
1389	1268756	Studies of the metabolism of asialotransferrins: nonspecific changes in the metabolic behaviour of human asialotransferrin in avians.	Hatton MW, Regoeczi E	Can J Biochem	 1976 Apr;54(4):336-40	 doi: 101139/o76-049	In a previous study (Regoeczi, E. & Hatton, M.W.C. (1976) Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 54, 27-34) it was shown that the chicken (Gallus domesticus) does not possess a hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor. In the present study the same conclusion is drawn for the duck (Anas platyrhynchos). For this reason these avian species were used to assess those changes in the distribution and catabolism of human asialotransferrin which takes place in the absence of the asialoglycoprotein receptor of the liver.
1390	933309	A hematologic survey of captive waterfowl.	Shave HJ, Howard V	J Wildl Dis	 1976 Apr;12(2):195-201	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-122195	Hematologic parameters were studied in giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima), mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) and various species of diving ducks at seasinal intervals throughout the year. Highest values for packed cell volume, hemoglobin content and erythrocyte counts were found in the winter and pre-nesting periods. Mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin varied inversely with these values.

Mueller NS	J Exp Zool	 1976 Feb;195(2):207-14	 doi: 101002/jez1401950205	Embryos of the Rouen duck were treated on day 11 to 18 with a single injection of estradiol benzoate in the air chamber. After hatching, skin grafts were exchanged between male ducklings that had been treated with estrogen in ovo and control males. The results showed that the skin of male embryos can be permanently feminized to the same extent as untreated female embryos simply by exposing embryonic male skin to female sex hormones during embryogenesis.
1392	1010494	Serologic examination of birds from the area of southern Moravia for the presence of antibodies against arboviruses of the groups Alfa, Flavo, Uukuniemi, Turlock and Bunyamwera supergroup. II. Wild living birds.	Kolman JM, Folk C, Hudec K, Reddy GN	Folia Parasitol (Praha)	 1976;23(3):251-5		280 specimens of 29 species of wild living birds from 11 families captured in the endemic area of the virus Lednice in Southern Moravia (CSSR) were investigated by haemagglutination-inhibition test (HIT) on presence of antibodies against 12 arbovirus antigens of the groups Alfa-virus (Western and Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis, Semliki, Sindbis, Chikungunya), Flavovirus (Tick-Borne Encephalitis, Dengue, West Nile), the Uukuniemi group (Potepli), the Turlock group (Lednice) and the Bunyamwera supergroup (Tahyna, Calovo). Antibodies were found only against the virus Lednice, merely in water birds--i.e. in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)--31.9%, in Grey Lag-Goose (Anser anser)--17.2%, and in one of three Mute Swans (Cygnus olor). In relation to these findings the question of ornithophilia of mosquitoes of Culex modestus species, which are the only probable vectors of Lednice virus as yet, is discussed.
1393	139997	Ultrastructure of 3 beta HSDH (delta 5-3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)-containing cells in ducks. III. Hybrid ducks (Anas platyrhynchos male X Cairina moschata female) during egg laying	Deray A, Gomot L	C R Seances Soc Biol Fil	 1976;170(5):987-91		All the cells of the ovary of the hybrid duck (Peking duck X Barbary duck) which contain an active 3 beta HSDH enzyme show ultrastructural characteristics of steroid cells: a smooth, developed reticulum, tubularcrested mitochondria, a considerable "charge" in lipid inclusion. These cells are found not only in the internal theca of follicles as with the female gender, but also in the cortical zones void of germinal elements, a tendancy particular to the female.
1394	134787	Cyto-immunological study of the anterior pituitary somatotropin cells of male and female adult Peking, Barbary and hybrid (from crossing male Peking X female Barbary) ducks and of male ducklings of the 3 races)	Marchand CR, Bugnon C, Bloch B, Fellmann D	C R Seances Soc Biol Fil	 1976;170(1):79-82		The anti-human-STH immunserum applied on hypophysis sections of adults males and females Peking (Anas platyrhynchos L.) Barbary (Cairina moschata L.) and Hybrid (from the mating male Peking X female Barbary) ducks, marks orangeophils, oval- or round shaped, PAS negative cells exclusively localized in the caudal lobe of the pars distalis. In the males ducklings of the three races this immunserum reveals numerous and partially exhausted cells. The authors conclude that the acidophils alpha cells observed in the caudal lobe of the duck are somatotrophic cells.
1395	1213054	Sorbitol dehydrogenase in Anas platyrhynchos and Zenaida auriculata auriculata during development.	de Fabro SP, Goldemberg AL, de Speroni NB	Experientia	 1975 Dec 15;31(12):1405-7	 doi: 101007/BF01923212	Sorbitol dehydrogenase (E.C.N. 1.1.1.14) was studied in liver, kidney and gonads of Zenaida auriculata auriculata (golden pigeon) and of Anas platyrhynchos (creole domestic duck) from South American faunes. The specific activity of SDH increased from embryonic to adult stage and is higher in the Anas platyrhynchos tissues. The electrophoretic studies performed in liver and kidney of both species during development showed variations in the number and intensity of the bands in accordance with the age and the species.
1396	1201590	The effect of cervical vagotomy (decentralization) on the ultrastructure of the carotid body on the duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Butler PJ, Osborne MP	Cell Tissue Res	 1975 Nov 19;163(4):491-502	 doi: 101007/BF00218494	Carotid bodies of ducks show no detectable changes in ultrastructure up to periods of four weeks following the removal of 2-3 cm of the cervical vagus (decentralization). This indicates that the majority, and possibily all the nerves terminating on the glomus cells are afferent (sensory) in nature. These nerve endings are in reciprocal synaptic contact with the glomus cells and therefore have efferent and afferent functions. Theories concerning the carotid body receptor mechanism are discussed with particular reference to those theories which ascribe functions to the reciprocal synapses.
1397	16811877	Persistence of acquired behavioral control in the context of imprinting.	Eiserer LA, Hoffman HS, Klein SH	J Exp Anal Behav	 1975 Nov;24(3):255-66	 doi: 101901/jeab197524-255	Newly hatched Khaki Campbell ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were exposed to a moving object that immediately suppressed distress vocalizations occurring in a novel environment. The static visual and auditory features of this object acquired the ability to suppress distress vocalizations after eight 20-min sessions of exposure to the object in motion. The acquired suppressive properties of these features were found to persist throughout thirty 20-min sessions given over 10 days. During these sessions, the ducklings were continually exposed to the static features in the absence of visual movement. In a second experiment, the ability of these features in the absence of visual movement. In a second experiment, the ability of these features to serve as reinforcement for a pecking response was shown to persist for up to 56 hr. In one duckling, presentations of the static visual features did not maintain pecking behavior. However, it was shown that pecking responses could be re-instated in this duckling by introducing novel stimuli to the environment.
1398	1239228	Effects of testosterone propionate on the social behaviour of groups of male comestic ducklings Anas platyrhynchos L.	Balthazart J, Stevens M	Anim Behav	 1975 Nov;23(4):926-31	 doi: 101016/0003-3472(75)90116-5	One-month old testosterone-injected ducklings were observed in groups of three males and their social behaviour compared to that of oil-injected control birds. Most elements of adult sexual behaviour and one pattern of aggressive behaviour (chest fight) occurred more frequently in the experimental animals. It was shown that the same hormonal treatment induces different behavioural responses in different animals. Unlike previous studies, no social displays were observed in the testosterone-injected ducklings. Possible explanations of this fact are discussed.
1399	1195498	Fluoroacetamide (1081) oisoning in wild birds.	Shlosberg A, Egyed MN	J Wildl Dis	 1975 Oct;11(4):534-6	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-114534	An outbreak of poisoning in four greylag geese (Anser anser) and 35-45 teal (Anas crecca) is described. Laboratory findings led to the conclusion that a wheat bait containing the rodenticide fluoracetamide (1081) caused the poisoning. Circumstantial evidence incriminated fluoracetamide as the cause of death in white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and chukars (Alectoris chukar).
1400	57744	Effects of hypothalamic lesions on levels of plasma free fatty acids in the mallard duck.	Hawkes MP, George JC	Arch Int Physiol Biochim	 1975 Oct;83(4):463-70		Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were measured in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) following hypothalamic lesions at various sites. The results indicate that ventromedial lesions produced hyperphagia, increased deposition of fat, and significantly elevated levels of plasma FFA. Anterior bilateral lesions resulted in aphagia, severe loss in body weight and a marked decrease in plasma FFA. Lesions in other regions of the hypothalamus produced various changes depending upon the extent of damage. The neural and neuroendocrine mechanisms which regulate FFA levels in the blood are discussed with respect to the involvement of pituitary hormones.
1401	1175207	Correlations between brain catecholamines, neurosecretion, and serum corticoid levels in osmotically stressed mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).	McNeill TH, Abel JH Jr, Kozlowski GP	Cell Tissue Res	 1975 Aug 18;161(2):277-83	 doi: 101007/BF00220374	The effects of depleting brain catecholamines with a combined treatment of reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine on serum corticosterone levels and release of immunoreactive neurophysin from the median eminence, in osmotically stressed and unstressed mallard ducks, were studied. Corticoid levels in salt loaded birds were more than three times that of unstressed birds. The combined treatment of reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine significantly decreased the concentration of brain monoamines in all experimental groups and raised serum corticoid levels in non-stressed birds to the same level found in the osmotically stressed animals. Immunoreactive neurophysin in the zona externa of the median eminence was depleted in all birds subjected to either osmotic stress and/or reserpine treatment but not in unstressed control birds. These preliminary data indicate that catecholamines may exert an inhibitory influence on both ACTH release from the anterior pituitary and neurophysin from the median eminence and that these two events may in some way be interrelated in the duck.
1402	169995	Corticoid uptake by the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus of the duck, Anas platyrhynchos.	Abel JH Jr, Takemoto D, Hoffman D, McNeill T, Kozlowski GP, Masken JF, Sheridan P	Cell Tissue Res	 1975 Aug 18;161(2):285-91	 doi: 101007/BF00220375	3H-corticoids were localized by autoradiography in small neurons in the area of the magnocellular paraventricular nucleus of mallard ducks. Correlative data show that: (1) the label is principally unmetabolized steroid, (2) the hypothalamus competitively binds corticosterone, (3) the paraventricular nucleus contains immunoreactive neurophysin, is richly innervated by boutons of monoaminergic nerves and is involved in the adaptive response to osmotic stress.
1403	1238438	Isolation-induced aggression in newly hatched ducklings.	Hoffman HS, Boskoff KJ, Eiserer LA, Klein SH	J Comp Physiol Psychol	 1975 Jul;89(5):447-56	 doi: 101037/h0077063	Newly hatched Khaki Campbell ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were initially housed in pairs and subsequently transferred to isolated housing conditions. Subjects living with another bird displayed filial behavior and little aggression upon encountering another duckling in a test arena. In contrast, ducklings housed in isolation exhibited aggressive pecking in addition to filial behavior when another duckling was subsequently encountered. In Experiment 2, ducklings were housed with an imprinting object (i.e., an object that elicits attachment behavior), but they were otherwise isolated from other birds. These subjects displayed little aggression when they were subsequently reunited with a conspecific, indicating that the aggression-precluding effects of social housing are not limited to the particular social stimulus with which the ducklings are housed. In Experiment 3, ducklings were again housed with an imprinting object, but this time the object was behind glass, thereby precluding tactile contact with it. Since these birds also exhibited little aggression when reunited with a conspecific, it is apparent that visual stimulation from an imprinting object is sufficient in itself to preclude subsequent aggression. These findings suggest that stimulation that elicits attachment behavior is the critical factor mediating isolation-induced aggression.

Bahl AK, Pomeroy BS, Easterday BC, Mangundimedjo S	J Wildl Dis	 1975 Jul;11(3):360-3	 doi: 107589/0090-3558-113360	Four type A infleunza viruses were isolated from tracheal swabs taken from apparently healthy ducks (mallards, Anas platyrhynchos) along the Mississippi flyway in Minnesota. Inital identification of group A influenza was made possible by the use of the agar gel precipitin test.
1405	241234	Virus neutralizing antibodies to arboviruses in birds of the order Anseriformes in Czechoslovakia.	Ernek E, Kozuch O, Nosek J, Hudec K, Folk C	Acta Virol	 1975 Jul;19(4):349-53		Sera from birds of the order Anseriformes in Czechoslovakia were examined for virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies to arboviruses. VN antibodies to Sindbis, Calovo and Tahyna viruses were found in 15, 5 and 6 out of 106 greylag goose (Anser anser) sera. Out of 38 ducks, 6 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 1 garganey (Anas querquedula) contained VN antibodies to Sindbis virus, 6 mallards to Calovo virus, 4 mallards and 1 garganey to Tahyna virus, 2 mallards and 1 garganey to tick-borne encephalitis (TE) virus and 1 mallard to West Nile (WN) virus.
1406	1171123	Comparison of scotopic sensitivity in diurnal (Anas platyrhynchos) and crepuscular (Dendrocygna autumnalis) ducks.	Wells MC, Lehner PN, Bolen EG, Rylander MK	J Comp Physiol Psychol	 1975 Feb;88(2):940-4	 doi: 101037/h0076444	Scotopic visual adaptation curves were obtained from 4 mallard ducks. A curve of best fit was used to compare the mallards' mean adaptation curve to the curve previously reported for the black-bellied tree duck, a crepuscular species. The curves did not differ significantly in either their slopes or base levels (thresholds). The mallards curve had a rod-cone "break" at approximately 25 min. This break is evident in the scotopic curve for pigeons, but is absent from the black-bellied tree ducks' curve. Examination of retinal tissues indicated that the black-bellied tree ducks had significantly more rods and cones, and a larger rod:cone ratio than the mallards. The mallards' scotopic visual threshold is exceeded by the natural illumination present under several nocturnal conditions.
1407	24173099	Lipid pattern and Na(+)-K (+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity in the salt gland of duck before and after adaptation to hypertonic saline.	Karlsson KA, Samuelsson BE, Steen GO	J Membr Biol	 1971 Jun;5(2):169-84	 doi: 101007/BF02107722	Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were fed hypertonic saline for eight days, resulting in an activation and hypertrophy of the salt gland. The Na(+)-K(+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase, an enzyme generally assumed to be part of the active Na transport system, increased its specific activity by about 200% during this activation. Sulfatides, the major glycolipids of the salt gland, increased their concentration to the same extent. Cholesterol, cerebrosides, and six phospholipid classes showed an increase of 20-80%.
1408	17774128	Radiotelemetry of the Respiration of a Flying Duck.	Lord RD Jr, Bellrose FC, Cochran WW	Science	 1962 Jul 6;137(3523):39-40	 doi: 101126/science137352339	Respirations of a flying wild mallard duck, Anas platyrhynchos, appear to be synchronized with wing beat in a ratio of 1 to 2. Wing beats come during exhalation and between respirations. The average number of respirations was 14 per minute for a resting duck and 96 per minute for a flying duck.
